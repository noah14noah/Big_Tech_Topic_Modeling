The Danish programmer is a successful entrepreneur who has testified before Congress to argue that Big Tech firms should be more regulated and started an anti-Facebook campaign. He is chief technology officer of Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration software, and is also the creator of a widely used software development framework called Ruby on Rails.</p><p><br/>Hansson spoke with The Associated Press to discuss remote work in the age of the pandemic and why Big Tech's power should be limited. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.<br/>Q: Basecamp is mostly remote. Has the pandemic affected how you work?<br/>A: So Basecamp has been been remote for about 20 years and we have all the systems and processes in place to be able to make that a pleasant experience. But I think what's important to look at with the pandemic is that it's not just remote work, it's remote work during a pandemic. So we have a lot of parents at the company. About half the people at Basecamp have families who all of a sudden have to deal with childcare at home or a spouse who has to share the one home office there. So the pandemic part of it has definitely been difficult.<br/>Q: Now we've been doing this for a few months, we've seen many companies basically switch to remote mode. Have you seen other companies making mistakes switching to remote work?<br/>A: The No. 1 mistake I've seen from other companies suddenly being forced to go remote has been that they tried to recreate the office remotely. So if what happened at the office was a bunch of meetings early on Monday morning, those just turned into some calls.<br/>And this whole idea that you can recreate the office remotely is a nonstarter. It's not a great way to work. Most companies, when they work in the office, work in a very synchronous way that's dictated around a meeting schedule that mandates where people have to be at a certain time.<br/>Getting rid of that and switching to an asynchronous work style where people don't have to be at a certain place at a certain time is the key to unlocking both the productivity and the sanity of anyone working remotely during a pandemic.<br/>Q: You have been critical about companies like Apple and Google being monopolies. Why do you think they're dangerous?<br/>A: The power that Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others have right now to dictate the terms of the digital economy, to capture the lion's share of all economic activity is unprecedented, astounding and incredibly dangerous.<br/>From 2000 to 2010, I think most people uncritically looked at these companies with just applause. Oh, isn't Google amazing? Isn't it wonderful we can connect to old classmates on Facebook? Look at all these wonderful devices. Apple is putting out.<br/>That was the honeymoon phase where these companies faced very little critical reception. That's not the case anymore. I don't think there's a lot of people who are just cheering on. Oh, isn't Facebook just universally amazing? Isn't it wonderful that Apple has an iron grip on all distribution of software to the iPhones in such a way that they can shake down individual software makers for 30 percent of the revenue?<br/>I think some of these storylines now have taken over this uncritical applause that these companies used to have. And that's a huge, powerful and important change that's paving the way for these regulatory actions. I mean, virtually all energy that goes in to legislation or regulation comes from public perception changing.<br/>Q: Is the way to fix this through regulation?<br/>A: I think these companies are now so large that they are to some extent immune from the normal pressures of competitive forces that normal companies operate under. If a normal company that does not have a monopoly continues to do bad things to piss off large numbers of their partners, vendors and customers, those partners, vendors and customers will simply choose another option.<br/>That can't happen when you have a monopoly. When there literally is no choice than to go through, say, the App Store to sell software to iPhone users. All you can do is kick and scream. And Apple knows this.<br/>What needs to happen is regulatory action, whether that is mandates on these companies' behaviors such as preventing them from monopoly abuses, of dictating terms of payment services, or, in Google's case, opening up their search index to other search engines so that they can use that.<br/>Q: Can you talk about your Facebook Free campaign? What is it exactly?<br/>A: So in 2018, well, in advance of what's been going on recently with the advertising boycott, Basecamp came to the conclusion that we should not be voting for more Facebook in the world. We had run some tests, an advertising test in 2017 that used Facebook, and we felt icky doing that.<br/>The Facebook machine is a massive engine of privacy and exploitation where targeted advertising violates the privacy of the recipients. And we thought, you know, why are we in this? Why are we doing this? Are we doing it just because everyone else is doing it? That's not a good reason. We need to stop.<br/>So we decided we would not spend any advertising dollars on any of Facebook's platforms. We didn't want more Facebook in the world. In 2020, clearly, we're no longer early on that. And hopefully it will stick and hopefully it will help change what Facebook is and again, not so much because Facebook is afraid of losing this revenue, but because public opinion will be in part turned by this, which will again fuel legislative and regulatory actions so that we get out of this dystopian hellhole that is a Facebook dominated world.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMAN-M1297522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HK-2Y51-DYDW-74C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Manufacturing News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The 'grand bargain' would continue existing opt-out consent requirements, except for critical services collecting sensitive personal data. </p><p>It rejects the notion of 'privacy by design' as well as data-minimization/data retention limitations and the right to be forgotten that is found in European law. In addition, it also rejects any private right of action to remedy violations. ITIF's 'grand bargain' would also preempt state laws such as California's Consumer Privacy Act and replace all existing federal privacy laws including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The proposal yielded a stinging rebuke from SenatorRichard Blumenthal (D-CT)[2] who stated : If Big Tech thinks this is a reasonable framework for privacy legislation, they should be embarrassed. This proposal would protect no one - it is only a grand bargain for the companies who regularly exploit consumer data for private gain and seek to evade transparency and accountability. Big tech cannot be trusted to write its own rules - a reality this proposal only underscores. I look forward to rolling out bipartisan privacy legislation that does in fact 'maximize consumer privacy,' and puts consumers first.

Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) said at the House hearing on Tuesday. \"When their data is misused, it's really outrageous we've let if get this far.\"</p><p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) even jibed at Democrats, saying House Republicans worked on privacy legislation since 2013, when Democrats were too enamored with the tech industry to rein it in.</p><p>\"We now realize this data-sharing is not a bug,\" Blackburn told industry leaders. \"It is a business model, and it has made Big Tech a whole lot of money by exploiting the use of this data. It's nice to come in here and talk about what we're going to do, but you all have been doing this for years. Trust is number one. They don't trust you now. What are you doing about that?\"</p><p>The industry witnesses didn't have an answer. So Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pushed harder.</p><p>\"What you've shown us so far is that you're willing to look the other way, that you're willing to put profits over people,\" he said. \"I think most people have no idea of the vastness of their vulnerability and how much data is collected, whether it's their locations or the voices of their children through toys or devices (like Alexa) they use in the name of security.\"</p><p>Senators also pressed the industry witnesses on what they think is a \"misuse\" of consumer data. Not all agreed on one definition, and some offered purposefully cryptic answers.</p><p>For example, even though Dodge said the retail industry wants a stronger privacy law than California's, he also defined misuse of consumer data as \"the relationship between retailers and customers is buying goods and services, so anything dramatically departed from that is misuse,\" a vague definition at best.</p><p>But not all the industry witnesses were so cagey. The Interactive Advertising Bureau's Chief Executive Officer Randall Rothenberg described a scenario where he's googling recipes for eggs, then that data is shared with his insurance company, then his insurance company raises the price of his insurance because eggs might negatively affect his cholesterol.</p><p>That, he said, is a gross misuse of consumer data.</p><p>Espinel told the Senate that tech industry culture must change in order for tech companies to stop misusing consumer data.</p><p>\"I think we need to have a culture where companies are focused on the consumer, and protecting the consumer,\" she said. \"Companies should be limited to uses that are relevant to the stated purpose of why they are using the data. I think it comes back to the consumer and having that as the central tenet for how companies are thinking about data.\"</p><p>Industry witnesses at the Senate hearing and tech experts at the House hearing mostly agreed that a federal privacy law should preempt state ones, except for a few outliers. Lawmakers' biggest concern is that a patchwork of state laws would hurt small businesses and chill innovation.</p><p>At the Senate hearing, Northeastern University's Professor of Law and Computer Science Woodrow Hartzog said he teaches his students to expect to deal with a patchwork of state laws on a variety of issues, so the argument that state regulation stifles innovation may not be true, because many industries consider it a legal reality.</p><p>\"In the United States we have a tradition of dealing with a patchwork of state laws,\" he said. \"While there are virtues to consistency, in my opinion it is not the obstacle that would strike me as the first thing we have to do to get privacy right.\"</p><p>Despite some pushback from some tech experts, all senators or representatives with statements or comments on privacy said they want a federal standard that preempts state laws.</p><p>Neither the House or the Senate unveiled draft privacy legislation at the hearings, but the industry expects draft legislation soon. Members of both chambers continue to hint that legislation is in the works.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Similar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.</p><p>  Lawmakers sent the requests on the same day they asked for scores of documents and personal emails from top executives at the four tech companies, according to the people. All of the companies have until mid-October to respond.</p><p>  The additional letters to more than 80 companies show the breadth of the offensive forming against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The recipients of the requests range from smaller firms in retail and advertising to large corporations in entertainment, software and social media, the people said.</p><p>  A range of companies, including News Corp., Oracle, Spotify, TripAdvisor and Yelp, have complained about the behavior of the four big tech companies and were likely to have received the requests. It was unclear how the queries to the more than 80 companies are split among the four tech giants.</p><p>  One person familiar with the requests said lawmakers decided against publicizing the requests to protect the complaining companies from potential retribution from the four tech firms -- though those firms have said they do not retaliate against critics.</p><p>  Companies have protested Silicon Valley's growing size and influence for years, but regulators and lawmakers in Washington have sharply increased their focus on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in recent months.</p><p>  The House investigation is largely centered on the market power and alleged anticompetitive practices by the four companies. The committee is examining accusations that the big companies favor their own products over rivals, buy smaller firms to head off competition and leverage their size to further cement their dominance.</p><p>  Lawmakers are also scrutinizing how the companies avoid taxes, are used to spread disinformation and handle people's personal information.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have said in the past that they face ample competition and do not engage in anticompetitive practices. When asked on Friday about the letter sent to the more than 80 companies, none of the companies offered additional comment.</p><p>  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that House lawmakers had sent requests to some of the tech companies' rivals.</p><p>  The various investigations are just beginning in earnest. How far they will go, what they will uncover and whether any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain.</p><p>  It is also not clear how the tech companies will defend themselves. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, met with President Trump and held discussions on Capitol Hill about election security, privacy and other issues.</p><p>  Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said on Thursday that it was time for the companies to be more upfront with the public.</p><p>  ''We've had a lot of talk from Facebook, and we have a troubling pattern, when they're up on the Hill, of them saying things that turn out to be either very misleading or at the end of the day it's just not true or they just don't follow through on it,'' Mr. Hawley said.</p><p>  The Department of Justice sent Google a formal request for information this year, and Facebook has acknowledged it is the subject of an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. When the agencies divided up responsibility for handling competition questions about Silicon Valley this year, the Justice Department also took Apple and the F.T.C. got Amazon.</p><p>  State attorneys general around the country have also banded together to start separate investigations into Google and Facebook.</p><p>  The House Judiciary Committee has held multiple public hearings on the subject of the tech companies' market power as part of its inquiry. It escalated last week when it sent the formal requests to the tech companies and their critics.</p><p>  In a statement last week, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee's investigation, called the document requests ''an important milestone'' in the fact-gathering stage.</p><p>  Separately on Friday, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, and Mr. Cicilline met with Mr. Zuckerberg, who left the meeting without offering a comment.</p><p>  Mr. Cicilline said afterward that Mr. Zuckerberg had offered an ''ongoing commitment to cooperate in the investigation, and that's a whole range of things, obviously document requests, requests for information, participation in a number of different ways.''</p><p>  ''And I take him at his word,'' he said.Jack Nicas reported from San Francisco and David McCabe from Washington.

San Francisco[1] and Seattle tech giants, like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, are doing particularly well during this pandemic. Amazon recently announced its intention to hire 100,000 new warehouse workers to meet the greatly increased demand the platform is experiencing. Facebook says its video calling traffic and private messaging have soared. And Microsoft's Teams software, an online collaboration tool, spiked tremendously in the past week. It looks like we may need to worry about small businesses and startups more than the big tech companies.Doubling Down on Digital ServicesIn self-isolation, many Amazon customers are ordering grocery and over-the-counter medicine delivery. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.hamodia.com/hamod-uploads/2020/03/2020-03-17T165654Z_1424045985_RC2SLF9U5FON_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AMAZON-COM-1024x409.jpg\">https://images.hamodia.com/hamod-uploads/2020/03/2020-03-17T165654Z_1424045985_RC2SLF9U5FON_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AMAZON-COM-1024x409.jpg</url>Netflix and YouTube's streaming numbers have seen a considerable bump recently, to the point where European officials asked both companies to reduce their video quality for streaming for 30 days so they don't hog up the bandwidth throughout the continent. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google were the strong contenders in cloud computing for enterprises, and they've continued to grow with more and more companies utilizing their data centers as employees shift to remote work. According to Microsoft executives, this sudden, global shift to remote work will completely change 'how we work and learn.' Facebook's WhatsApp app is mediating more voice calls than ever. Although the app and Facebook see a large spike in user engagement on New Year's Eve, the coronavirus spike is well beyond the typical New Year's Eve traffic. Daniel Ives is managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. He says, 'The largest tech companies could emerge on the other side of this much stronger.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/apple-store-london.jpgOne\">https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/apple-store-london.jpgOne</url> Step Forward &amp; Two Steps Back?But that's not to say the same large tech companies and many others aren't floundering due to the self-isolation mandates. Combined, the stocks of Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, have lost $1 trillion in market value[2] since the recent U.S. stock market crashes. Uber and Lyft are experiencing major slumps due to people socializing less. Airbnb's customer base has essentially vanished as users shelter in place, only leaving their home for groceries or restaurant take-out. Globally, the world economy (which was at $3.9 trillion last year) is expected to suffer greatly this year. It's not certain how badly the economy will be hurt, but we'll likely not experience any overall growth globally. What's also unknown is how long this war against the virus will last. If people don't follow self-isolation guidelines well enough, we may be experiencing virus-related problems until the end of the year. However, when life returns to normal for most people, the tech giants will benefit from users who changed their consuming habits during the quarantine.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://s3-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/amazon_prime_whole%20foods_i.jpg\">https://s3-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/amazon_prime_whole%20foods_i.jpg</url> Michael Crowe, who lives in Charlotte, N.C., ordered groceries from Amazon a few days ago for the first time ever to avoid going out to the local supermarket. 'I could see myself doing it longer-term when this is over,' Crowe said. Indeed, when most of the tech giants post their final numbers at the end of the year, they'll likely be the ones showing a profit, while many other companies, large and small, will declare bankruptcy.Problems With Medical ApplicationsOne major part of the coronavirus pandemic is the lack of access to adequate medical services, resources, and facilities. With Trump declaring a national emergency, the red tape has been peeled off of many medical rules and regulations. And because the major tech giants have their hands in almost every single new and emerging technology, they're able to provide high-quality tools and resources as part of the medical development[3] effort. For example, previously, privacy rules prevented health care companies and providers from using video chat features created by Apple and Facebook. Now, even though the tech giants all have a problem with data privacy, encryption, and security, it's easier for doctors and patients to get in touch with each other without having to jump through a lot of hoops.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/Inc_Second_Full_Page-final-web1_407735.jpg\">https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/Inc_Second_Full_Page-final-web1_407735.jpg</url> Congressmen and congresswomen hope that the new way of telehealth conferencing and remote monitoring during this crisis will carry over as the new and normal way of managing health. And it's not as easy as turning on the webcam for a patient consultation: telehealth providers will need to be current on federal rules and guidelines for screening and treating coronavirus. Providers will also need to be trained on patient comfort, using the technology, and troubleshooting the software. Privacy advocates fear that these lax guidelines will increase the risk for leaks and hacks of private and sensitive health data. These experts fear that the health system will rely on telehealth much more after the pandemic, and there are not enough laws and regulations governing the use of these conferencing systems and the data they generate.An Era of Uncertainty for BusinessIt's extremely uncertain how the next few days, weeks, and months are going to go. We will definitely see many businesses shutter their doors, while bigger companies thrive throughout and after the pandemic.

Websites kept loading. Apps kept opening. But what left UK technology entrepreneurs aghast was not just that Britain has chosen to leave the EU, but that all those years of trying compete with the giants of Silicon Valley could now be thrown into doubt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although Europe's 500 million citizens dwarfs the 323 million in the US, European startups had to deal with 28 jurisdictions, legislation and languages. But the EU had at least managed to harmonise (more or less) company operation, data sharing and hiring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hiring from a talent base of 500 million people was also an incredible asset to startups, as was raising funding from Venture capitalists. Based in Berlin? No problem. Developers in Slovenia, but the HQ is in London? No problem. And, after several Eastern European states had joined, suddenly the whole of Europe could tap into talent produced from Soviet-era education systems built on engineering and maths.</p><p>The truth is the overwhelming majority of the UK tech startup industry was for 'Remain'. Industry body COADEC found over 80% of companies were in favour of staying in the EU, citing the single market, free movement of labour and stability.</p><p>But Brexit has now thrown into enormous doubt how all of that will operate in the future.</p><p>The immediate effects on startups have been incredibly personal. Bewilderment is the word you hear most. European staff suddenly have no idea how long they will be able to work in Britain. They created friendships, relationships, often marriages. Their kids are in nursery schools and high schools across the country.</p><p>So many tech startups today are created by young people, who voted in droves for Remain. The decision to leave Europe will have disproportionate effects on them and their companies, which, ironically are often labelled by politicians as being the jobs of the future.</p><p>What now for them?</p><p>The immediate reaction of some in the sector has been typically entrepreneurial. \"Stay calm and make lemonade,\" wrote leading investor Saul Klein <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(see page 16 for how he thinks Remainers can reconnect with Britain)</emphasis>. VCs have been quick to come out as upbeat - anything not to 'frighten the horses' and potentially spook the pipeline of possible new companies to invest in (dubbed 'dealflow').</p><p>Klein's sanguine attitude is reflected by many VCs. Early stage startups are agile and can relocate if need be. Big tech companies are global and not overly dependent on the UK But VCs have warned that mid-stage companies too dependent on the UK could feel the heat of Brexit.</p><p>Taavet Hinrikus, Co-founder and CEO of TransferWise, a declared 'Remainer', says he is \"moving on\". His London-based company couldn't be more quintessentially European: he's an Estonian immigrant living in London. Half his staff are British, a third from mainland Europe, with others from the US, Latin America and elsewhere. TransferWise also benefits from \"passporting\": because it is regulated in the UK by the FCA, it's therefore regulated all across Europe. For now. But, he blogged, \"Five years ago, we chose to base TransferWise here in the UK - and we'll continue that plan.\"</p><p>And 'seize the day' was effectively the message put out by former Number 10 tech adviser Rohan Silva, who wrote in the Sunday Times that Britain should now embrace the technology future to use Artificial Intelligence to drive its society. Free from the constraints of a ponderous EU, the UK could now go feet-first into a tech-driven future. These were upbeat words from voices who had openly declared they were for Remain prior to the referendum.</p><p>However, the sunlit uplands of a world where the UK fully embraces the advances of technology seem suddenly far off when the realities start to bite closer to home.</p><p>The day after the referendum I was contacted by three separate startups to say their venture capital funding had been cancelled because they were being financially backed from the UK and were in the EU, or in the UK and backed by EU-based investors. Several more have come to me since with similar news. Uncertainty has gripped the normally upbeat tech sector.</p><p>And the complexity of the modern startup has been thrown into sharp relief. One UK-based founder contacted me: \"My entire budget is now completely invalid as we have employees in three different EU countries, and in the USA. We are deeply affected by the currency devaluation issue. Every single person I employ is from a different EU country. Most are based in London and now there is a real feeling of unease and uncertainty as to what will happened to them in the future - which means that this is affecting the day-to-day running of the business,\" she told me.</p><p>In addition, she was about to embark on a fundraising tour and was hoping to get US investors: \"I now think that this will be much more difficult, if at all possible. Which means that the six jobs I have created and the five more that I need to fill - will be in jeopardy.\"</p><p>The company in question also took on interns from underprivileged backgrounds. That programme will now likely be cancelled because of a lack of funding.</p><p>\"Long term I think I will have to relocate my business to the USA as the market in the UK is just too small to justify staying here,\" she told me. Others feel the EU had gone too far in regulation. One startup founder said the European Data Privacy Regulations could have \"ruined\" her online advertising business, which relies on being able to transport data between the EU and the US.</p><p>In Manchester, Tom New, CEO of Formisimo, believes startups in the North West and EU-backed UK regions will find it much harder to raise funding because part of their funding was EU-backed. Without that \"we would have likely have had to move to the South East and the North West's tech ecosystem would still be where it was back then,\" he told me.</p><p>The UK also could now face a potential brain drain of talent. Before June 23 London was seen as Europe's bigest powerhouse of startups. Just over a week later an adverting-hoarding truck was seen trawling the startup-filled streets of Shoreditch, extolling the benefits of moving to Berlin (London's chief tech startup competitor). The van was sponsored by a German political party. Suddenly other European hubs like Dublin, Berlin, Stockholm or Amsterdam look attractive as bases from which to reach the EU single market.</p><p>Tech companies will no doubt work around it all - moving people and HQs around, knowing they can all still work online. And it may be that the booming nature of a London's tech scene will now have to be spread more equally to Europe's other tech centres. Look for talented British entrepreneurs suddenly turning up in Berlin, Stockholm, Lisbon and Barcelona.</p><p>But one of the greatest myths ever told about the tech world is that it's about technology. The truth is, it's about people. And looking around at the average tech company, those people typically come from all over the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, the march of technology continues, as does the soul searching.

Websites kept loading. Apps kept opening. But what left UK technology entrepreneurs aghast was not just that Britain has chosen to leave the EU, but that all those years of trying compete with the giants of Silicon Valley could now be thrown into doubt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although Europe's 500 million citizens dwarfs the 323 million in the US, European startups had to deal with 28 jurisdictions, legislation and languages. But the EU had at least managed to harmonise (more or less) company operation, data sharing and hiring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hiring from a talent base of 500 million people was also an incredible asset to startups, as was raising funding from Venture capitalists. Based in Berlin? No problem. Developers in Slovenia, but the HQ is in London? No problem. And, after several Eastern European states had joined, suddenly the whole of Europe could tap into talent produced from Soviet-era education systems built on engineering and maths.</p><p>The truth is the overwhelming majority of the UK tech startup industry was for 'Remain'. Industry body COADEC found over 80% of companies were in favour of staying in the EU, citing the single market, free movement of labour and stability.</p><p>But Brexit has now thrown into enormous doubt how all of that will operate in the future.</p><p>The immediate effects on startups have been incredibly personal. Bewilderment is the word you hear most. European staff suddenly have no idea how long they will be able to work in Britain. They created friendships, relationships, often marriages. Their kids are in nursery schools and high schools across the country.</p><p>So many tech startups today are created by young people, who voted in droves for Remain. The decision to leave Europe will have disproportionate effects on them and their companies, which, ironically are often labelled by politicians as being the jobs of the future.</p><p>What now for them?</p><p>The immediate reaction of some in the sector has been typically entrepreneurial. \"Stay calm and make lemonade,\" wrote leading investor Saul Klein <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(see page 16 for how he thinks Remainers can reconnect with Britain)</emphasis>. VCs have been quick to come out as upbeat - anything not to 'frighten the horses' and potentially spook the pipeline of possible new companies to invest in (dubbed 'dealflow').</p><p>Klein's sanguine attitude is reflected by many VCs. Early stage startups are agile and can relocate if need be. Big tech companies are global and not overly dependent on the UK But VCs have warned that mid-stage companies too dependent on the UK could feel the heat of Brexit.</p><p>Taavet Hinrikus, Co-founder and CEO of TransferWise, a declared 'Remainer', says he is \"moving on\". His London-based company couldn't be more quintessentially European: he's an Estonian immigrant living in London. Half his staff are British, a third from mainland Europe, with others from the US, Latin America and elsewhere. TransferWise also benefits from \"passporting\": because it is regulated in the UK by the FCA, it's therefore regulated all across Europe. For now. But, he blogged, \"Five years ago, we chose to base TransferWise here in the UK - and we'll continue that plan.\"</p><p>And 'seize the day' was effectively the message put out by former Number 10 tech adviser Rohan Silva, who wrote in the Sunday Times that Britain should now embrace the technology future to use Artificial Intelligence to drive its society. Free from the constraints of a ponderous EU, the UK could now go feet-first into a tech-driven future. These were upbeat words from voices who had openly declared they were for Remain prior to the referendum.</p><p>However, the sunlit uplands of a world where the UK fully embraces the advances of technology seem suddenly far off when the realities start to bite closer to home.</p><p>The day after the referendum I was contacted by three separate startups to say their venture capital funding had been cancelled because they were being financially backed from the UK and were in the EU, or in the UK and backed by EU-based investors. Several more have come to me since with similar news. Uncertainty has gripped the normally upbeat tech sector.</p><p>And the complexity of the modern startup has been thrown into sharp relief. One UK-based founder contacted me: \"My entire budget is now completely invalid as we have employees in three different EU countries, and in the USA. We are deeply affected by the currency devaluation issue. Every single person I employ is from a different EU country. Most are based in London and now there is a real feeling of unease and uncertainty as to what will happened to them in the future - which means that this is affecting the day-to-day running of the business,\" she told me.</p><p>In addition, she was about to embark on a fundraising tour and was hoping to get US investors: \"I now think that this will be much more difficult, if at all possible. Which means that the six jobs I have created and the five more that I need to fill - will be in jeopardy.\"</p><p>The company in question also took on interns from underprivileged backgrounds. That programme will now likely be cancelled because of a lack of funding.</p><p>\"Long term I think I will have to relocate my business to the USA as the market in the UK is just too small to justify staying here,\" she told me. Others feel the EU had gone too far in regulation. One startup founder said the European Data Privacy Regulations could have \"ruined\" her online advertising business, which relies on being able to transport data between the EU and the US.</p><p>In Manchester, Tom New, CEO of Formisimo, believes startups in the North West and EU-backed UK regions will find it much harder to raise funding because part of their funding was EU-backed. Without that \"we would have likely have had to move to the South East and the North West's tech ecosystem would still be where it was back then,\" he told me.</p><p>The UK also could now face a potential brain drain of talent. Before June 23 London was seen as Europe's bigest powerhouse of startups. Just over a week later an adverting-hoarding truck was seen trawling the startup-filled streets of Shoreditch, extolling the benefits of moving to Berlin (London's chief tech startup competitor). The van was sponsored by a German political party. Suddenly other European hubs like Dublin, Berlin, Stockholm or Amsterdam look attractive as bases from which to reach the EU single market.</p><p>Tech companies will no doubt work around it all - moving people and HQs around, knowing they can all still work online. And it may be that the booming nature of a London's tech scene will now have to be spread more equally to Europe's other tech centres. Look for talented British entrepreneurs suddenly turning up in Berlin, Stockholm, Lisbon and Barcelona.</p><p>But one of the greatest myths ever told about the tech world is that it's about technology. The truth is, it's about people. And looking around at the average tech company, those people typically come from all over the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, the march of technology continues, as does the soul searching. Did those of us in London pay too much attention to our hackathons and our Flat Whites to notice that the rest of the UK wasn't interested in the tech startup revolution? It looks like we just found out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PICTURE, One of the Free Democratic Party's posters being driven around central London as it attempts to woo British startups to Berlin following the UK's vote to leave the EU, Photo: PA</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNUERO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNUERO2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NBK-G921-JC8V-44W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438601</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Archant Regional Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New European</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 8, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FREE DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009HPF</classCode><className>EDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp;

They all think America's technology titans are too big and powerful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The growing might of Google parent Alphabet, Apple Inc., Facebook and Amazon has been a recurring theme, particularly since last year when America's five tech kings became the five most valuable public companies in the world. The companies themselves haven't quite figured out how to deal with the hand-wringing over their power coming from politicians, regulators, academics and corporate enemies.</p><p>This backlash is one of the most serious business risks for America's tech superpowers, and they need to develop a coherent message fast.</p><p>I was surprised this week when Google executives seemed awkward addressing analysts' questions about regulatory investigations and data-privacy policies. At one point, Google CEO <person><nameText>Sundar Pichai </nameText></person>sounded as if he would have preferred to be trapped in Antarctic ice rather than tackle a query that touched on the company's move to combine data from several of its web services to improve ad targeting.</p><p>Mind you, the company first announced in 2012 that it was starting to share user information among Google services such as search and YouTube, and privacy watchdogs have howled about all subsequent policy changes that further mingle its troves of user data. When Pichai was asked whether Google's ads are more effective because of this data sharing, he vaguely talked about respecting users' privacy and being \"thoughtful.\"</p><p>A Word That Can Mean Anything or Nothing</p><p>Thoughtful</p><p>It's also possible European antitrust czars might eventually force Google to change its popular shopping ads in search results or how it distributes apps on Android phones. These changes could hurt Google financially, but Pichai and Alphabet Inc. Chief Financial Officer <person><nameText>Ruth Porat </nameText></person>either deflected questions on this or said Google would be fine if had to stop bundling many of its apps on Android smartphones. (If that's true, then why does it strike deals to ensure a number of its apps are pre-installed on Android smartphones?)</p><p>I don't want to overplay a few moments on an earnings conference call. But Google and the rest of the world's biggest tech companies now have problems everywhere. Thailand's king cracked down on Facebook Inc. because he was unhappy with images of himself. Canada's top court wants to change how Google search results are displayed globally. The U.S. Treasury Secretary hinted on Wednesday that the administration might target how Amazon.com Inc. handles sales taxes on products sold by independent merchants through its website.</p><p>Big Tech needs to learn how to competently discuss these issues with investors and the public. Somehow even the experience of the Edward Snowden intelligence leaks -- to which the tech giants were slow to respond -- didn't teach them a lesson.</p><p>The tricky thing is that discomfort about the tech superpowers is amorphous. There's no single policy issue or piece of legislation for the tech companies to rally around. It's all fragmented global issues stemming from general mistrust of companies that touch so many aspects of people's lives.</p><p>It's hard to have a coherent message about such hard-to-grasp concepts. Nevertheless, tech companies need to do better. Backlash is the cost of being successful.

Louisville won't present the same difficulty, but the Frogs will find another match-up problem with the Cardinals' 6-6 guard, Reece Gaines, who leads the team with 19.5 points per game.

Maurice Baker (17.2 ppg), recovering from a painful groin pull, wasn't the scoring machine he normally is (12 points) but played 37 minutes. His backcourt partner, Victor Williams, is up to 13.4, but Fredrik Jonzen continues to struggle at 12.0. Tyray Pearson (19.1) and Jake Sullivan (16.4) lead Larry Eustachy's Cyclones, who beat Missouri on Wednesday.

Or at the very least, a moral wrong. Neither is the right thing to do. But this is what big tech from the Silicon Valley have been doing for so long. They have been mining news gathered by newspaper companies to earn their fat ad revenues, all for themselves. The fault lies in the business model the big tech are using, what Bloomberg calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153content free-for-alls\u00e2\u20ac. This is slowly changing, and rightly so, as governments around the world come to realise that big tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stealthy ways and their impact on newspaper companies.</p><p>On Friday, the Australian government ordered Google and Facebook to negotiate with traditional media in the country on remuneration in good faith. This is no empty threat. If Google and Facebook fail to reach an agreement, things will get nastier: a binding arbitration process and penalties for breaching the media bargaining code of up to A$10 million or 10 per cent of local revenue will kick in. An example for Malaysia to follow? Google calls this Aussie move a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavy-handed intervention\u00e2\u20ac. Who is talking? For years traditional media companies watched helplessly as tech giants mined away their news gathered at great expense. Many bled out of existence. Big tech didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care then; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care now. Errant behaviour such as this needs to be regulated. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move is to correct what the government says is a power imbalance between two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most profitable companies and a local media industry that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bleeding jobs as it loses advertising revenue to digital platforms, according the Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Australia is doing the right thing. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just an Australian problem; it is a European problem and Asian problem as well. In Europe, France has done some Silicon Valley chasing, too. In April, French regulators ordered Google to pay media companies if they wanted to display \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snippets of articles\u00e2\u20ac. More interestingly, according to a Bloomberg report disclosing the order on April 9, the Autorite de la concurrence, the French antitrust regulator, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the search engine giant may have abused its dominant market power, causing serious and immediate harm\u00e2\u20ac to the media. No one should be surprised. In the words of Bloomberg, European publishers have been pushing regulators for over a decade to tackle the power of Google, which has lured away billions of euros in advertising revenue. This is the first time they have landed a punch.</p><p>Time for Asian regulators to do the same. Malaysia must deliver the punch for others in the region to follow. We needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reinvent the wheel either. Malaysia has a choice: the French one-two or the Australian uppercut. Either will sting like Muhammad Ali\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bee. But Malaysian regulators must first get big tech into the ring. They will not volunteer because the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153content free-for-alls\u00e2\u20ac model guarantees them free lunch for as long as we allow them to. Like in Australia, Europe and elsewhere, big tech are causing serious and present danger to journalism in Asia. Malaysia isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an exception. Google and Facebook know the value news displays bring them. They must pay for using the news. Failing this, like Australia, Malaysian regulators must order them to share the news revenue.</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H2-YBW1-JC85-C0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Desperate for the approval of others, and never long satisfied when we get it, we became hooked into an endless loop of posting and reciprocal clicking: thrilled when the Likes clocked up, despondent when they didn't.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/sean-parker-unloads-on-facebook-god-only-knows-what-its-doing-to-our-childrens-brains-1513306792-f855e7b4-4e99-4d60-8d51-2775559c2671.html\">knew right from the start</url> it was making something that would exploit vulnerabilities in our psychology, its founding president and now critic, Sean Parker, has said. And similar insights from the field of \"behaviour design\" or \"persuasive tech\", a discipline       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://captology.stanford.edu/about/what-is-captology.html\">founded at Stanford University in California in the 1990s</url>, are baked into much of big tech's hardware and software. Whether it is Amazon's \"customers who bought this also bought\" function, or the eye-catching red or orange \"something new\" dots on your smartphone app icons, big tech's products are not just good, but subtly designed to control us,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/addicted-tech-brain-chemical-imbalance-may-blame/\">even to addict us</url> \u2013 to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229710-600-obsession-engineers-mind-control-the-candy-crush-way/\">grab us by the eyeballs and hold us there</url>.</p><p>The result is the attention economy, whose currency is data. Every time we search for something, visit a website or like an image or news story or brand, Google and Facebook learn a little more about us. They use that information to tailor their services to us and keep us coming back \u2013 as well as to sell highly targeted advertising space. Similarly, the more Amazon knows about us, the more it can recommend items we really do want \u2013 and are more likely to buy.</p><p>Big tech's power comes mainly in the form of small, yet constant, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829221-700-nudge-youre-being-manipulated-have-you-noticed/\">behavioural nudges</url>, so it is often hidden. But its cumulative effect is like nothing before seen. It encourages us to think less about our decisions, be they which news stories we see, friends we interact with or events we go to, and be less aware of any alternatives. That crowds out competition, but also means information, for example, becomes judged not on truth, but on popularity: that's a big part of how the algorithms determine which stories to serve us. The result is fake news, accusations of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2115421-fake-news-shapes-our-opinions-even-when-we-know-its-not-true/\">fake news</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094629-beware-the-brexit-bots-the-twitter-spam-out-to-swing-your-vote/\">suggestions of elections lost and won through social media manipulation</url>.</p><p>The companies often don't know what they've built \u2013 it's a Frankenstein problem</p><p>\"We're no longer talking about harmless search algorithms. These companies permeate fundamental aspects of our lives,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/OlafGrothSF?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Olaf Groth</url> of Hult International Business School in San Francisco. \"These companies often don't really know what they've built,\" says internet policy adviser       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://researchictafrica.net/people/anri-van-der-spuy/\">Anri van der Spuy</url> at Research ICT Africa in South Africa. \"It's sort of a Frankenstein problem.\"</p><p>And the monster looks unstoppable. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, has said that the real threat to the company was the person working on the next big thing in a garage somewhere. But that's become just a fairy tale, says Moore. \"When you now have to invest upwards of \u00a3300-400 million in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130830-200-internet-30-how-we-take-back-control-from-the-giants/\">server farms</url> to make your system work, it's very hard to see anybody but the biggest people competing.\" And the established giants are streets ahead at collecting and analysing the data central to their business models. If they see anything threatening it, they just copy it \u2013 or buy it.</p><p>Take Waze. In 2006, Israeli coder Ehud Shabtai launched this app as a community project to let drivers share traffic information, for example about roadworks or an accident. By 2013, 50 million people were using it around the world, so Google bought it. Similarly, Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp. When Twitter became a competitor, Facebook made its newsfeed more Twitter-like. And when picture-messaging app Snapchat took off, Facebook added some of its popular features to its own service \u2013 so Snapchat is struggling. \"Any new competitor has a real mountain to climb,\" says Moore.</p><p>Sometimes this means better results for consumers. Waze's maps, for instance, now benefit from Google's unrivalled location data, and Waze's alerts pop up in Google Maps. But this market-narrowing behaviour has also caught the attention of perhaps the most public face of techlash, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's antitrust commissioner. In July 2017, Vestager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2139097-googles-e2-4bn-fine-is-small-change-the-eu-has-bigger-plans/\">fined Google a record \u20ac2.4 billion</url> for abusing its dominance in search to promote its online shopping business. She has also ruled that Amazon's EU tax arrangements are illegal, ordering it to pay back \u20ac250 million. Not content with that, European regulators are making noises about using antitrust laws to break up big tech companies \u2013 as are US politicians following the recent controversies about unregulated social media skewing elections.</p><p>But is that sensible? \"Antitrust law is a big tool, but it's a blunt tool,\" says Moore. It was first used in the US in the late 19th century to loosen the grip of large industrial monopolies such as the Standard Oil Company and keep consumer prices low. Even just a decade or so ago, Microsoft was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12654-microsoft-loses-antitrust-appeal/\">forced by the EU to stop bundling its Internet Explorer browser</url> and other proprietary software with Windows, which the EU viewed as abuse of its near-monopoly of computer operating systems.</p><p>This move, ironically, gave Google and its Chrome browser its big break. The problem now is not just that the tech giants give their best products away for free, but that they are also less easily cut down to size. Android phones alongside Google Maps, Chrome, Gmail and YouTube draw on a common pool of our data. Divorce any of those services from that source and they no longer work so well, while the central data hoard itself isn't obviously divisible. Ditto Facebook. Amazon, meanwhile, is essentially a logistics company with a vast shop window. Forcing it to stop selling certain types of product is like telling supermarkets they can sell fruit but not vegetables, says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/\">Benedict Evans</url>, a technology analyst at venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz in San Francisco.</p><p>An alternative is to change data protection laws to limit the power of companies whose lifeblood is data. That's the thrust of the EU's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130824-400-computer-says-no-europeans-can-now-challenge-that-decision/\">General Data Protection Regulation laws</url>, which come into effect in May. These will give people in Europe more say over how information about them gets used and force companies to be more transparent about what they do with it.</p><p>It is difficult to argue that's a bad thing, but Moore worries about unintended consequences. \"Not many policy-makers have thought through the whole ecosystem,\" he says. \"If they kick in one place, it's going to have a big effect somewhere else.\"</p><p>\"The internet is a global resource,\" says van der Spuy. \"You can't legislate or make decisions in one country, because it's going to affect the rest of the world.\" Clip the wings of big US companies and pretenders from other domains will take their place \u2013 Russia's search giant Yandex, for example, or Baidu, Weibo and Alibaba, China's answers to Google, Facebook and Amazon. Germany recently legislated to fine internet platforms if they don't take down fake news quickly, with the result, says Moore, that one of his students now sees his newsfeed differ dramatically depending on whether he views it in Germany or the UK.</p><p>That means the end to the web as a universal experience, even among countries with the same broadly liberal approach to censorship. But the distinction between even well-meaning state regulation and state censorship isn't a clear one. In 2014, Brazil enacted its Marco Civil, a bill of internet rights designed to protect people from surveillance and ensure access to popular online services. It has instead been invoked to ban WhatsApp in the country on at least three occasions, albeit only briefly, most recently when Facebook refused to provide chat logs related to a criminal investigation. Conversely, Apple's refusal in 2016 to weaken <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331100-600-encryption-wars-the-privacy-debate-raging-in-your-smartphone/\">security features such as encryption</url> to allow the FBI to crack phones apparently shows how big tech can stand up to overweening state power and defend privacy.</p><p>Arguably, big tech and the state now exercise similar power over our lives \u2013 with the difference being that we at least nominally have control over the state's actions. \"We don't want any one company, no matter what it is, having exclusive say over how decisions in our lives are made,\" says Groth. For him, the answer is self-regulation, and a 21st-century Magna Carta: a code of conduct that tech companies will voluntarily subscribe to. \"I don't want to stir up some anti-data intifada,\" he says. \"But as with other issues like climate change and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2146568-sugar-in-your-diet-the-not-so-mouthwatering-truth/\">sugar content in foods</url>, we need to become better educated and have some form of constructive voice in this as a society.\"</p><p>That would require engagement from big tech beyond \"do no evil\" self belief. Facebook only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116491-facebook-will-flag-false-posts-in-your-feed-to-tackle-fake-news/\">tardily and begrudgingly admitted</url> that its platforms might have assisted Russia's misinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential elections, while claiming that they were the best ones to deal with it by forging a global Facebook community. \"From Facebook's perspective, taking more responsibility and doing better means us doing more on Facebook, and them having more control of it,\" says Moore. \"That doesn't seem to be a place we want to be heading.\"</p><p>Turn off, tune out</p><p>Rosenstein certainly wants to find a different way. Now CEO of a company called Asana, he is still building software designed to funnel our attention. But his goals are now aligned with the principles of an organisation called <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.timewellspent.io/\">Time Well Spent</url>, set up by other big tech alumni, including some of Rosenstein's former colleagues. \"A lot of software tries to align users' attention with itself, with notifications or advertising,\" says Rosenstein. \"Our goal is to align users' attention with themselves.\"</p><p>For him, this means building software that shields us from distractions such as emails, app notifications and non-essential task reminders, and nudges us towards habits that help us focus on what we want to do.</p><p>A pipe dream, given big tech's attention-driven business model? Perhaps, but one positive consequence of techlash could be that the companies are taking heed. It is probably no coincidence that Mark Zuckerberg wrote last month (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571\">on Facebook, naturally</url>) that \"one of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent\". He was introducing changes to the platform's newsfeed that would give more weight to friends' posts, rather than news or commercial posts \u2013 part of Facebook's attempts, some think, to win back lost goodwill. Google, too, has begun a clean-up effort to stop controversial and \"fake news\" videos on YouTube getting an audience, as well as introducing stricter criteria for videos that want to earn money from ads, and vetting its more popular content. Apple has just faced calls from two shareholders to develop ways to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2157878-we-should-teach-kids-how-to-use-social-media-not-scare-them-off/\">combat smartphone addiction in the young</url>.</p><p>Time will tell how much of that is window dressing. Certainly, Facebook's refocusing does nothing to move away from the cycle of liking and wanting to be liked that hooks us to start with. But if big tech's power is based entirely on our behaviour, the most effective brake on their influence is to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22930560-600-take-control-of-your-life-by-mastering-the-force-of-habit/\">change our own bad habits</url>. The web is filled with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2152385-i-went-on-a-data-diet-and-all-i-got-was-ads-and-paranoia/\">tips for tuning out</url>. There are apps that hide notifications from other apps. Some people recommend setting your phone's screen to greyscale so your eye is less drawn to the candy-coloured icons. Or you can uninstall the apps that vie for your attention the most, keeping only those that you know you can control your use of, such as mapping apps.</p><p>Even Rosenstein, one of the architects of the modern social world, has now decided to opt out. \"I no longer have news apps on my phone or pretty much anything that could distract me,\" he says. \"If you're trying to lose weight, don't keep cookies in your pocket.\"</p><p>Ultimately, changing big tech will probably need a combination of approaches: governments nudging them from above, us squeezing them from below. Techlash serves a purpose in asking us what we want out of big tech, whose products make all our lives easier and more colourful. \"We veer between love and hate for these companies, but neither is quite right,\" says Moore. \"At the moment, there's a sense that we must intervene, we must bash them. But bashing for the sake of bashing doesn't seem very constructive.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article appeared in print under the headline \"Techlash\"</emphasis></p><p>Big tech is big</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2</emphasis> billionActive Facebook userssource: Facebook<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">88</emphasis> per centof Google's 2017 income came from advertisingsource: Alphabet<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">20</emphasis> per centof global spending on advertising goes to Facebook and Googlesource: Zenith</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg23731640500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKR-VXG1-DY5K-Y0M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 237</volume><issueNumber>No. 3164</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 7, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Then a rebound of market valuations hit the restart button. Scepticism towards US tech companies is on the rise. Expect a summer of renewed activism from privacy and antitrust campaigners.</p><p>The bigger the tech industry\u2019s combined market capitalisation, the more fuel is handed to those who argue the sector is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2e09235-b28e-438d-9b55-0e6bab7ac8ec\"> too powerful.</url> Last week, Apple became the first $1.5tn company \u2014 less than two years after reaching a $1tn market capitalisation milestone. Tech stocks have helped the wider US market to climb despite an economic downturn and country-wide protests. Just five tech companies: Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and Apple now account for almost 23 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 index. Five years ago they made up less than 10 per cent. </p><p>In the early days of the crisis Big Tech appeared to take a leading role in the response. Apple and Google won praise for their unexpected decision to work together to produce contact-tracing technology. Demand for cloud computing, video chat apps, online delivery and ecommerce were boosted by lockdowns. By late April, more than one-third of people questioned in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://theharrispoll.com/pandemic-blunts-tech-backlash/\"> US Harris Poll</url> said their view of the tech industry had grown more positive since the pandemic began.\u00a0</p><p>Public goodwill is now waning. Wary consumers are more likely to support regulatory intervention. Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all face investigations by the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice. Both Alphabet and Facebook face state investigations. The EU plans new digital platform regulation. </p><p>Companies could find Europe a more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1711b919-7699-4f5c-8881-113ac107601b\"> hostile environment</url>. Take Amazon. If its prices were deemed below cost its conduct could be unlawful under EU competition law, says the Brookings Institution. Yet below-cost prices would not violate US antitrust law. </p><p>The most drastic potential outcome are forced break-ups. Sum of the parts analysis suggests investors might benefit. Needham analysts see the combined shares of Alphabet\u2019s various companies trading one-third higher than the existing group. Yet the odds are slim. Microsoft, ordered to break up in the late 1990s, proves that rulings do not necessarily lead to division. </p><p>It will pay for tech to keep political relations friendly. In the first quarter of the year Facebook spent more than $5m on lobbying, according to database OpenSecrets, more than the annual average over the past three years. Instead of\u00a0broad antitrust legislation in the near future expect more fines, more voluntary corporate action and much more lobbying. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Have the tech giants got a problem coming?

The current techlash environment, and the overall neutrality framework proposed, means the proposals will have some momentum, especially in Europe.</emphasis>French regulator Arcep is looking to create a new framework to ensure the Internet remains open end-to-end, adding the principles of device or platform neutrality to the already-regulated principle of net neutrality. Arcep believes the lack of openness of devices, through the use of applications, and its domination by a few major operating systems pose a threat to consumer choice, which must be addressed. We believe the current context of industry backlash against the bigger tech companies will drive momentum for Arcep's proposals, especially in Europe.</p><p><table><title>Arcep's Proposals For A Fully Open Internet</title><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"432\"/><thead valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Proposals</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Definitions</p></entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Data-driven regulation</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>&amp;#xD;  Gather information from device manufacturers and OS providers, and disseminate it; &amp;#xD; Gather reporting from end users, both consumers and businesses; &amp;#xD; Promote comparison tools; &amp;#xD; Impose transparency on the indexing and ranking criteria that app stores use. &amp;#xD; </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Increase fluidity</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>&amp;#xD;  Closely monitor and, once tried and tested, assess initiatives designed to facilitate device switching. &amp;#xD; </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Lift certain restrictions imposed by key device market players</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>&amp;#xD;  Allow users to delete pre-installed apps; &amp;#xD; Enable alternative rankings for the online content and services available in app stores; &amp;#xD; Allow users to easily access applications offered by alternative app stores, once they have been deemed reliable; &amp;#xD; Allow all content and service developers to access the same device functions; &amp;#xD; Monitor the evolution of devicesa content and service exclusivity practices. &amp;#xD; </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Act quickly</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>&amp;#xD;  Invent an agile procedure for supporting businesses, and particularly SMEs and start-ups, when they encounter questionable practices. &amp;#xD; </p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Arcep   The table above highlights Arcep's proposals to improve transparency and consumer choice when it comes to device usage. The first primary targets are smartphones and tablets, and we believe this is where the regulator's argument is the weakest. While it is true that operating systems, including PCs, are dominated by three major companies - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> - and that usage has moved from web browsing to applications, we do not believe it has significantly harmed consumer choice. Users are still able to use and download the applications of their choice, and the issues raised by Arcep, such as pre-installed apps or their inclusion in a store, are already being investigated by antitrust and competition authorities in multiple markets, with Google having already been found guilty over Android. The tools are already in place.However, Arcep is right to raise the issue when it comes to future devices, such as smart speakers, voice assistants and even connected cars. In these situations, where voice becomes the key interface, regulatory tools need to be updated, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> another key company targeted, and the main issue being consumer choice. When using voice to purchase a product or ask for any information, unless the consumer is being very specific (such as asking for a specific brand), the platform will decide which particular product or which information to convey to the user, raising clear questions about competition.We believe Arcep will gain traction for its latest proposals, because it does so under the right context and at the right time. There is an industry backlash against big tech, and especially its largest companies. This means that any proposals will at least be considered, if not implemented, as governments look to regain the upper hand against the digital giants. This will especially be the case in Europe, which aims to take a leading role in digital regulation, and the balanced neutrality framework under which it has made its proposals, with network neutrality against telecoms operators, and device neutrality against technology companies, is likely to find supporters. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WEUTLI-1343189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WEUTLI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTD-F921-F0J5-84FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Arcep believes the lack of openness of devices, through the use of applications, and its domination by a few major operating systems pose a threat to consumer choice, which must be addressed.

The first primary targets are smartphones and tablets, and we believe this is where the regulator's argument is the weakest. While it is true that operating systems, including PCs, are dominated by three major companies - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> - and that usage has moved from web browsing to applications, we do not believe it has significantly harmed consumer choice. Users are still able to use and download the applications of their choice, and the issues raised by Arcep, such as pre-installed apps or their inclusion in a store, are already being investigated by antitrust and competition authorities in multiple markets, with Google having already been found guilty over Android. The tools are already in place.However, Arcep is right to raise the issue when it comes to future devices, such as smart speakers, voice assistants, and even connected cars. In these situations, where voice becomes the key interface, regulatory tools need to be updated, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> another key company targeted, and the main issue being consumer choice. When using voice to purchase a product or ask for an information, unless the consumer is being very specific (such as asking for a specific brand), the platform will decide which particular product or which information to convey to the user, raising clear questions about competition.We believe Arcep will gain traction for its latest proposals, because it does so under the right context and at the right time. There is an industry backlash against big tech, and especially its largest companies. This means that any proposals will at least be considered, if not implemented, as governments look to regain the upper hand against the digital giants. This will be especially the case in Europe, which aims to take a leading role in digital regulation, and the balanced neutrality framework under which it has made its proposals, with network neutrality against telecoms operators, and device neutrality against technology companies, is likely to find supporters. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1343189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RNK-00Y1-F0J5-82MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Business Monitor International Ltd.

After surviving multiple scandals, some wonder whether the sailing is going to get even tougher for Facebook, Twitter and other companies as the US political year heats up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the longest time, US technology giants like Google and Facebook could count on loose regulations and generally favourable reactions, at least from politicians in their domestic market. They tended to be seen as dynamic, flagship companies that secured America's place in the world of tomorrow.</p><p>Those times are gone.</p><p>In 2019, \"techlash\" struck the large Silicon Valley platform technology companies with full force, reshaping their relationship with US authorities. When Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is called before committees of the US Congress these days, he's often met with open hostility.</p><p>Google, Facebook and Amazon are subjects of an antitrust investigation by the US Justice Department. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Party candidate in the 2020 presidential election, advocates breaking up big tech companies to promote more competition. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) slapped Facebook with a record 5-billion-dollar fine for privacy breaches in July.</p><p>When Amazon announced plans to build a 25,000-employee second headquarters in the Queens borough of New York City, opposition from residents, activists and local politicians was so fierce that it abandoned the project. English actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, known in part for his movie \"Borat,\" recently made waves by calling Facebook and other social media \"the greatest propaganda machine in history.\"</p><p>How have things come to this?</p><p>A turning point was the US presidential election campaign in 2016, when Facebook and Twitter in particular were not only used by clever campaign strategists, but also to an unprecedented degree by propaganda teams from Russia. Nor was the public image of social media helped when Zuckerberg described the notion that fake news on Facebook may have influenced the election outcome as a \"pretty crazy idea,\" an assessment he later walked back.</p><p>Then Facebook was pilloried in 2018 for the scandal involving the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica, hired by US President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. In 2014, the firm gained access to private information on tens of millions of American Facebook users, which was used to target voters with personalized political advertisements.</p><p>The uproar over the data breach, which had occurred years earlier and looked almost harmless compared with several other slip-ups by Facebook, was a sign of the times.</p><p>However, the mood of the US populace is darkening. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based \"fact tank,\" the share of Americans who see technology companies as having a positive impact on the United States has tumbled to 50 per cent from 71 per cent four years ago. What's more, negative views of the companies' impact on the country have nearly doubled during this period, from 17 to 33 per cent.\u00a0</p><p>US politicians have left no doubt that the country's big technology companies face tighter regulations. But with a presidential election less than a year away, political calculation may beplaying a part. An investigation by the Justice Department into whether major digital technology companies engage in anti-competitive practices comes amid claims by Trump that they suppress conservative views.</p><p>At the same time, Facebook has been criticized for its decision not to automatically take down provably false content from politicians - and thereby stay out of the political fray.\u00a0</p><p>That said, business continues to go splendidly for the technology giants. Facebook easily digested the FTC fine in just a quarter. And Google, hit with antitrust fines from the European Union now totalling more than 8 billion euros (about 9 billion US dollars), ploughs ahead unfazed. The companies' users also keep growing in numbers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by:\u00a0Niels C\u00a0Sorrells, +49 30

Yet 2019's tidal wave did not quite break.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The movement has long been predicted: indeed, \"techlash\" was awarded digital word of the year by the American Dialect Society last January. It also made the shortlist of last year's Oxford English Dictionary (OED) words of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industry fears of a techlash were all the rage in late 2018 and well into 2019. From the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to shareholder revolts against Facebook, the phenomenon was perhaps most visible in the repeated grilling of technology chief executives before the US Congress and MPs in Parliament.</p><p>But the techlash faltered before it could truly take hold.</p><p>Facebook was slammed with fines, but they hardly made a dent on its income. The tech giant received a slap on the wrist from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office of \u00a3500,000, the maximum it could receive, for failures related to Cambridge Analytica. When it was slammed with a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) fine from the Federal Trade Commission, it barely blinked and its share price went up. In March, Google was hit with its third $1bn-plus fine by the European Commission.</p><p>Yet collectively, Big Tech has continued to soar this year. Facebook shares are up more than 50pc, Google nearly 30pc. Facebook has continued to pile on new users; it now has 2.5bn in total. The social networking giant is expected to post revenues of $70bn this year, up from around $56bn in 2018. Hardly signs of a crippling slowdown.</p><p>Following Facebook's fine and an order from the FTC last summer, former Facebook head of security Alex Stamos says: \"This is a natural consequence of the shallow nature of the techlash.\" The real problem, he says, is a lack of meaningful competition against Facebook and a failure of US privacy laws.</p><p>While politicians have railed against technology firms, it can be argued that their grip over users' digital lives has only grown stronger. On average, Brits spend three hours and 15 minutes each day online. Despite concerns about \"fake news\", more people are getting their news from social networks. Across the pond, 52pc of US adults get their news from Facebook, according to research from Pew.</p><p>In the advertising sector, some data suggests that technology giants have actually consolidated their power since new data regulations such as GDPR came into effect. The smallest advertising technology companies lost market share after it was introduced, but Google only grew.</p><p>Thomas Philippon, a professor at NYU Stern and author of The Great Reversal, a book on competition, says: \"In the US, we have seen a steady decline in enforcement in antitrust and regulations. Now there is a shift towards finally acknowledging there is a problem in digital markets.\"</p><p>He adds: \"Everyone understands there is a problem, but maybe some are paying just lip service.\"</p><p>Europe has certainly been ahead of the curve in cracking down on technology giants. While some people accuse Brussels of unfairly targeting US firms, many of its reforms are being copied in the US at a state level.</p><p>\"The one regulator that has taken a more active stance is the EU competition commission,\" says Florian Ederer, a professor at Yale. \"But more radical people argue that its billiondollar fines are just a slap on the wrist.\" Philippon reckons there has been a change in attitude in the past year, particularly in the US, where heavy regulatory changes could be on the way. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has demanded rules to break up Apple, Google and Facebook if she is elected president next year.</p><p>Furthermore, investigations into the activities of Google, Facebook and Amazon are under way. The FTC is now thought to be considering an injunction against Facebook to stop its efforts to merge its Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram services - a move that critics claim is an attempt by the technology giant to stop it being broken up. Even the Republicans have turned their ire on Facebook and Google, accusing them of suppressing free speech by demonstrating bias against conservative voices.</p><p>\"It's quite an achievement by Facebook that they are one of the only things policymakers in Washington agree on,\" says Philippon. \"They are the only people in the US who can encourage a bipartisan agreement.\"</p><p>Could 2020 actually bring reforms that curb the power of GAFA [Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon]? The UK may be heading that way: the Competition and Markets Authority recently launched a consultation on proposals that could break up part of Google. In Whitehall, there are discussions surrounding a new Digital Markets Unit to be a technology regulator.</p><p>Theresa May's Government floated plans for a regulator that could perform a duty of care and tackle malicious content, while Boris Johnson's manifesto in the recent election proclaimed a desire to make the UK the safest place to be online.</p><p>Germany has taken matters further.</p><p>The Bundestag is currently preparing its digital competition laws - the Digitalisierungsgesetz - which would make control over data a key factor in determining if a company is behaving anti-competitively.</p><p>According to law firm Hogan Lovells, there are as many as 450 pieces of legislation or rules proposed in 2019 that could fall on Big Tech in 2020. But as the decade draws to a close, there are perhaps even more pressing challenges - and more radical solutions - that could emerge.</p><p>Calls to break up Big Tech will most likely be a key battleground of the 2020 US election. \"What is weird about this market is it is critical to everyday life and national infrastructure, but it is all funded on an advertising model,\" says Professor Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. \"That's not sustainable.\"</p><p>Even fiercer regulation, such as classing services such as Facebook as utilities, could emerge, she suggests.</p><p>Meanwhile, technology companies are not standing still.

After a year when the big tech companies were rocked by scandals over data privacy concerns, reports of election manipulation and censorship practices, the Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar declared \"techlash\" the word that best summed up 2018. It was named digital word of the year in voting last week by the American Dialect Society (over which I presided). The Economist has been issuing dire admonitions about a backlash against the tech elite ever since November 2013, when an editorial warned of a \"coming tech-lash.\" </p><p>Oxford Dictionaries, which included \"techlash\" on its own shortlist for 2018 words of the year, identified that editorial as the first known use of the portmanteau term combining \"technology\" and \"backlash.\" Oxford noted that it initially was hyphenated, \"only later settling into its one-word state\"-a typical evolution for this kind of lexical blend.The success of the blend relies on being able to identify the \"-lash\" syllable as a shortened form of \"backlash,\" defined as a strong reaction by people against a trend or development. \"Backlash\" emerged in the early 19th century as a mechanical term for a jerking motion caused by loosely connected gears or other machine parts. \"Lash,\" in turn, has meant \"a sudden or violent blow\" since the 14th century, especially the strike of a whip. \"Lash\" also got transferred to the flexible part of a whip that delivers the blow. Other \"lash\" words followed from these basic meanings. \"Eyelashes,\" for instance, are so called because they resemble the lash of a whip. (In Old English, an eyelash was commonly known as a \"bru,\" which also meant an eyebrow or eyelid.) The rise of the term \"backlash\" for an adverse social reaction in the 20th century gave rise to all sorts of new variants. The 1964 presidential campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater was responsible for several such terms. Johnson faced a backlash from some white Democratic voters for the passage of the Civil Rights Act, which was confusingly called both a \"blacklash\" since it involved African-American civil rights, and a \"whitelash\" since whites were the ones reacting negatively. (As I wrote in a November 2016 column, \"whitelash\" reappeared in commentators' assessments of Donald Trump's electoral victory.)During the 1964 race, Johnson responded to poll numbers about the \"backlash vote\" by pointing to the possibility of a backlash against the backlash, which pollsters termed the \"frontlash\"-voters flipping to support the Democratic ticket because Goldwater's views were seen as too extreme. Johnson dissected the \"backlash\" and the \"frontlash\" on the campaign trail and even introduced a new variant, \"smearlash,\" for the backlash against Goldwater's negative campaigning.In a \"Peanuts\" comic strip from October 1964, the cartoonist Charles Schulz spoofed these developments. Linus was running for student body president, and his sister Lucy presented him with poll numbers showing that he was winning \"the backlash vote, the frontlash vote, the whiplash vote, the eyelash vote and the tongue lash vote.\" (Linus lost the election after giving an impassioned speech about the Great Pumpkin.)After the Johnson-Goldwater showdown, the creation of new \"-lash\" words died down, with occasional innovations cropping up like \"Vietlash,\" coined in 1968 by the syndicated columnist Joseph Kraft to describe a backlash against those protesting the country's growing military involvement in Vietnam. Half a century later, the \"techlash\" has emerged as a potent new social reaction to reckon with, and technology leaders would be wise to fear its repercussions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019011049049577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V67-B561-F103-33JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

After a year when the big tech companies were rocked by scandals over data privacy concerns, reports of election manipulation and censorship practices, the Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar declared \"techlash\" the word that best summed up 2018. It was named digital word of the year in voting last week by the American Dialect Society (over which I presided). The Economist has been issuing dire admonitions about a backlash against the tech elite ever since November 2013, when an editorial warned of a \"coming tech-lash.\" Oxford Dictionaries, which included \"techlash\" on its own shortlist for 2018 words of the year, identified that editorial as the first known use of the portmanteau term combining \"technology\" and \"backlash.\" </p><p>Oxford noted that it initially was hyphenated, \"only later settling into its one-word state\"-a typical evolution for this kind of lexical blend.The success of the blend relies on being able to identify the \"-lash\" syllable as a shortened form of \"backlash,\" defined as a strong reaction by people against a trend or development. \"Backlash\" emerged in the early 19th century as a mechanical term for a jerking motion caused by loosely connected gears or other machine parts. \"Lash,\" in turn, has meant \"a sudden or violent blow\" since the 14th century, especially the strike of a whip. \"Lash\" also got transferred to the flexible part of a whip that delivers the blow. Other \"lash\" words followed from these basic meanings. \"Eyelashes,\" for instance, are so called because they resemble the lash of a whip. (In Old English, an eyelash was commonly known as a \"bru,\" which also meant an eyebrow or eyelid.) The rise of the term \"backlash\" for an adverse social reaction in the 20th century gave rise to all sorts of new variants. The 1964 presidential campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater was responsible for several such terms. Johnson faced a backlash from some white Democratic voters for the passage of the Civil Rights Act, which was confusingly called both a \"blacklash\" since it involved African-American civil rights, and a \"whitelash\" since whites were the ones reacting negatively. (As I wrote in a November 2016 column, \"whitelash\" reappeared in commentators' assessments of Donald Trump's electoral victory.)During the 1964 race, Johnson responded to poll numbers about the \"backlash vote\" by pointing to the possibility of a backlash against the backlash, which pollsters termed the \"frontlash\"-voters flipping to support the Democratic ticket because Goldwater's views were seen as too extreme. Johnson dissected the \"backlash\" and the \"frontlash\" on the campaign trail and even introduced a new variant, \"smearlash,\" for the backlash against Goldwater's negative campaigning.In a \"Peanuts\" comic strip from October 1964, the cartoonist Charles Schulz spoofed these developments. Linus was running for student body president, and his sister Lucy presented him with poll numbers showing that he was winning \"the backlash vote, the frontlash vote, the whiplash vote, the eyelash vote and the tongue lash vote.\" (Linus lost the election after giving an impassioned speech about the Great Pumpkin.)After the Johnson-Goldwater showdown, the creation of new \"-lash\" words died down, with occasional innovations cropping up like \"Vietlash,\" coined in 1968 by the syndicated columnist Joseph Kraft to describe a backlash against those protesting the country's growing military involvement in Vietnam. Half a century later, the \"techlash\" has emerged as a potent new social reaction to reckon with, and technology leaders would be wise to fear its repercussions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019011049050959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V67-B561-F103-33KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the SaudiOPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the SaudiOPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us. Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, October 26th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average down 250 points right now. That's 1 percent lower. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent. And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq. That is two and a third lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning. Take a look at European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points lower. The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower. And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some cases. But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this morning. Take a look. Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this morning by a fraction. It had better than expected results and also better than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well. The company's profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the stock. Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also weighing on the stock. We're going to tell you what happened there at Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture. The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix. Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE: -- to fully automate discovery, and the second is discovery to get robots. Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE) because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview together. We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as well. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR: Good morning. Nice to be here, I think. We have a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a tough market this morning.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: Big morning. President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting times. We're seeing it in the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting times.</p><p>PETE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've been bullish on this market pretty much. Has anything changed?</p><p>BLOCK: I've gotten bullish down here. I wasn't that bullish to start out with. I've always been growth over value. Right now, my premise is this. Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged. You can go out and break your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the 30-degree weather. It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness. But I think over time when you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to talk about this because we want to zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points. Technology's leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings last night. The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see. Facebook down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5 percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67 percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty. Larry -- it's good to see you. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS: Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for example.</p><p>HAVERTY: I absolutely think it has -- Maria. You look at these stocks and they've been almost a religion. And I think some of the people are getting out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the easiest place to start. If you look at their report on the surface, it looks terrific. They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts developing. I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth. And you look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India. They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years and the shareholders sent the stock up. So that's a warning sign to Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY: The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin pressure from this shortage of employees. You go down to Florida and there are so many help wanted signs. I just don't think there are any legal workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY: And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY: So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create this uncertainty. Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: This is the longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II. It's been up for 115 months. The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of concerns. You've got China starting to slow down. Auto sales in China went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the most recent month. That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe. And in the U.S. interest rates are going up. They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example. Texas Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health. They do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015. So it's been almost three years since they missed the top line. They talked about every major end market slowing down and they weren't sure when it was going to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>NILES: I think you absolutely are. And this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of inventory out there. So if you pick the biggest company in the world -- Apple, for example. They have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported. The revenues are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well? They're going to have to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. And that's why we're seeing revenue under pressure -- Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Right. Dan Niles was mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations. That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the revenue?\" And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs because your taxes are lower. Ultimately if you're a growth company, you better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.</p><p>HAVERTY: Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening. And in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure. You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HAVERTY: And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China. China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is scary. So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't -- I think stocks are reasonable now. I don't think they're expensive. But they certainly aren't cheap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PETE: I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and after all, that does bring the multiples down. I'm not talking about tech necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.</p><p>HAVERTY: Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're --</p><p>PETE: Right -- which is another big factor --</p><p>HAVERTY: -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY: The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling. Most mutual fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market. And that pressure is going to erode. And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at 3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a 5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\" You know, what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them grow a little faster.</p><p>PETE: Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY: I think we're close to the bottom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day, the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent. So can you get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market, that's -- there you go.</p><p>BLOCK: We'll see. There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage pressures and the effect that they have on margins. I heard this argument six months ago. Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this. Banks were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases. That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got. And those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here? Can retailers pass on price increases in the holiday season?</p><p>HAVERTY: I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20 plus times for Google. So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be. The world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply accelerating their capital spending. And we'll see how that works later on. And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. But I think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HAVERTY: So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have been programmed not to like margin pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course, yes.</p><p>HAVERTY: And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're doing their thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Humans don't like margin pressure also. Machines and humans -- they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>HAVERTY: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very much appreciated. Larry Haverty joining us there.</p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package. The very latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning. Take a look at what we're expecting at the start of trading. Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost 1 percent. S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent. And the Nasdaq with a decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out. But this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10 suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well Maria -- federal investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida. They searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night. Several pipe bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These pipe bombs being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the rising cost of health care. Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries. If approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew. It's called the Witch's Brew frappuccino. Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty much an orange creamsicle. Not to give this away, I'm sorry. But that's basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which is green. They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat, breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\". There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Weird. That's weird.</p><p>CASONE: The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set. And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited time. This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino. And last year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino. Now we're getting the Witch's Brew Frappucino.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What color was the zombie? Do you remember? Was it the same color?</p><p>CASONE: No it wasn't purple as this one. The Zombie was more green. It's funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup. I'm like yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE: Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do these just work? Do these gimmicks work?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do they get people in?</p><p>CASONE: The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE: I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK: This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE: Well, we don't talk calories on the show.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK: It's gluten free. It's keto-friendly. Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: None of the above.</p><p>CASONE: Diet November 1st, people, come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right. Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning -- disappointing results from Amazon and Google. Those stocks lower and that is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure. The Dow Industrials down 200 points. The Nasdaq down 141. We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well. The Energy Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector. Oil prices falling as oversupply becomes a concern. As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the SaudiOPEC governor says a potential oil glut could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Secretary -- it's good to see you.</p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY: It's good to be here -- Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So your reaction to that? Are we looking at a glut now?</p><p>PERRY: It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and downs. So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but that can vanish in a hurry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and bigger producer. So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?</p><p>PERRY: Well, the world market does. And, you know, this is a global market. The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing country in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>PERRY: By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter. I mean it's just fascinating what's happened in a decade. It shows what innovation and technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all kinds of energy. When you think about the European market, the American LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also obviously relying upon other countries. You've got problems in Venezuela. You've got problems in Angola. The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest oilfield in the world --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>PERRY: -- is pipeline capacity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about that? What do we need to do in terms of infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?</p><p>PERRY: The President is really focused on this. He understands that you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues there. And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live literally. That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this infrastructure as fast as we can. That means FERC has got to be moving and moving quickly. That means that agencies that have regulatory control over all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very expeditious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Understood.</p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next week or --</p><p>PERRY: Correct, in November.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Next week -- in November. What's the impact on the oil market?</p><p>PERRY: Well obviously, we don't know completely. I suggest that the market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in, those contracts were already been forwarded by then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Anticipated.</p><p>PERRY: Anticipated -- yes, ma'am. So I don't think there will be much in the market standpoint. Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to Iran. Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have to face these kind of things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today. Tell us about that. Why is this facility important? Why are you going there?</p><p>PERRY: Well we have 17 national labs. And these are the most fascinating -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria. These national labs, all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos, through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of Energy. early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So these are medical labs?</p><p>PERRY: No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs. But they also -- we delve into things like into water. I mean these are where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on the end of Long Island. So this is my 17th lab to go to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY: This gets me --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America, right, what's really going on.</p><p>PERRY: And that's what national labs are really about, you know. You've got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD. They do like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant. They're fascinating men and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know that.</p><p>PERRY: It's fascinating work that's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain -- Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY: Correct. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on this migrant caravan? I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night. What do you see?</p><p>PERRY: Yes. I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges while I was the governor in the state of Texas. I asked for -- I requested 800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border of the United States. And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank God.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Especially since you have a whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on line to get in legally.</p><p>PERRY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line. So --</p><p>PERRY: You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is going to be sacrosanct. If you want to come in the United States, you come in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PERRY: And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up and say, we're going to stop it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PERRY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning, disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets. We've got more on that coming up after this.</p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd. The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the opening of trading this morning.</p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on markets this morning because revenue was light. Look at Amazon, down nine percent. Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent. Investors are watching out for that.</p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales numbers last night. And it is digging through the tech sector this morning. Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well. Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100 down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.</p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this morning. Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than Stellar earnings as well. We were just watching the price of oil which is down about one percent.</p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive. The leaders weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is the best in the business. CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE: It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion in R&amp;D. We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff we've got that's now available in the Cloud.</p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25 years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures. Almost like a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated. Hard for a customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and tools and middleware, etcetera.</p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to Larry's point. And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations. And our Cloud, we have one, one configuration.</p><p>Well, it's scaled. Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I understand. I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I was speaking to some financial services executives the other day. Jamie Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their data, on cyber in the next year. Which is -- that's what I'm saying. These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE: Well, --</p><p>BARTIROMO: To have any vulnerabilities.</p><p>ELLISON: Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon. I think he's the world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE). I probably made some enemies by saying that. He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.</p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their network, it's challenging for J.P. Morgan -- you know Chase to protect their network.</p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise. They can spend $1 billion. We spend more than $1 billion securing our network. So does Facebook. So does Google. It's a hard problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who are the bad actors? What do they want? Do they want to just -- what, they want anything, steal money? What do they want? And who are the bad actors?</p><p>ELLISON: There are two -- there are two classes. There are people who want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money. And then there are state actors who want to gain intelligence.</p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the -- Office of Personnel Management it's called. And the state actor took all of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I remember that (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>ELLISON: Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were able to analyze it. And they -- for example, they did something very clever. They said these are the people who work for the government. These are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city. How come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the capital city that aren't in the list of government employees? Maybe they all work for CIA.</p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just comparing data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>ELLISON: So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a much better job of securing -- of securing data.</p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't patch their databases in a timely fashion.</p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to fully automate the database patching. You have to fully automate threat discovery and the second is discover, your robots. Discover your robots have to patch it. Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many things more important than this.</p><p>HURD: Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURD: So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry and I have. I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HURD: -- is at the CEO level. The example that Larry just brought up, there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON: Yes.</p><p>HURD: And actually didn't implement it.</p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an encrypted Oracle database. Less, you talked about unlimited spending. Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are encrypted. Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not implemented it.</p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do. By the way, in our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.</p><p>ELLISON: Yes, there's no option. Right now -- historically, the customers were they've given a choice, encryption, optional. You can turn it on. Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little bit. In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted. It's encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.</p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to know what you even have. This one big customer who -- you know, had to go to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database called Apache Struts. And they -- there was a big security vulnerability. And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases. They couldn't even find all their databases.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you know, consumer financial records.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels. We know that. So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about growth. Does this even become part of the conversation? You cannot -- you know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your data.</p><p>HURD: First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only one that has this capability. So, when you look at the market depending on which competitors you're talking about. You know, we invest in technology. I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the entire company which is to continue to innovate.</p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through, patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent. The separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HURD: And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?</p><p>HURD: I told you what I thought yesterday. I mean, I think the U.S. economy is going fine. And when we look particularly at mid-market and I gave you the example of some of our --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Net suite.</p><p>HURD: -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURD: Which has had an unbelievable run.</p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more salespeople, to add more engineers. But at the same time, our net suite business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our fiscal Q1 in bookings.</p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE). Most of that growth was in the United States. And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is in the U.S. it's growing. It's investing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks coming up.</p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf custodian to tears by signing happy birthday. The amazing video, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are troubled this morning. Take a look, we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the Dow. S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of 147 points, that's better than two percent. NASDAQ getting hit as technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within tech.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be headed to Washington. Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Just getting this news this morning, Maria. National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's accepted. President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July. Trump was criticized after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding election meddling. Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the 2016 election.</p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris commemorating the end of World War I.</p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping. The maker of, yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from their store shelves. They're also removing exotic flavors from the market. This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me, called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic. Those flavors of course, very popular with kids. Altria stock is down 12 percent so far this year.</p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear James.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school. The Hickerson Elementary Kindergarten class surprised their friend. He's the custodian there known as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as you can see, they signed it as well. And I don't know, Maria, I think he's holding back tears in this video. It's kind of hard to see. But it was great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is beautiful.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'm crying.</p><p>CASONE: (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how sweet that all those kids learned it. That's tough. Sign language is hard, right, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it. I still know the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet. I taught myself out of the encyclopedia Britannic when I was five.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. That was so sweet. Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.</p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a prominent Democrat. RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh in. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now. I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel. Ronna, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC: Thanks for having me. Always good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how are you feeling 11 days out? Tell us -- set the stage for us for these midterm elections. What's most important and what has changed?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote. And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina. He reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP. We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, the money has been an issue, right? The last time we spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats. Tom Steyer in California $120 million. How are the Republicans doing on the money end of thing?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to buy this election. And so, we know what this congressional members would do if they come to Washington. They'll be withhold unto the special interest. But the RNC has raised record money. We just passed $269 million raised. We're putting it into the ground game in all these states. We've been building it for two years.</p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016. And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and we have something to say.</p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP. Our country is on the rise. What are Democrats going to say? We've obstructed and resisted at every turn? They have nothing to run on except stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their pocketbooks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the presidents' most vocal critics.</p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning. Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this. Funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential. Your reaction?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has said this is a time to unify. He has condemned obviously these heinous acts by these cowardly individuals. And the Democrats did the exact opposite. They play the blame game. They continue to divide. You saw the head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and Sarah Sanders.</p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why we need more Republicans in Washington. We need to reject the Democrat playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night. He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton. And he basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked out of restaurants because they lie. So, I mean, it's almost like they continue to have this dog whistles.</p><p>MCDANIEL: Yes, it's shameful. It's not good for our country. And the president has stepped up and led.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you. Thanks very much.</p><p>MCDANIEL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ronna Romney McDaniel.</p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure. We've got a lot more ahead of the GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018102602cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK6-S5S1-DXH2-64YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7394\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 26, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PJX</classCode><className>ALTRIA GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00022UF</classCode><className>TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p> Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p> For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p> Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p> Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p> Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p> Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p> All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p> PETE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p> BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p> The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p> We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p> Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p> Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p> And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p> HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p> Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p> But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p> And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p> But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p> You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p> What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p> I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p> They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p> NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p> Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p> One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p> So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p> I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p> PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p> HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p> So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p> PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p> BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p> Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p> Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p> Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p> HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p> I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p> So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p> So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p> But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p> Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p> HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p> Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p> Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p> This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p> Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p> Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p> Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p> It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p> CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p> Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p> CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p> PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p> CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p> CASONE:  I know.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p> CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p> Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p> Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p> RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p> PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p> With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p> So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p> So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p> The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p> PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p> When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p> So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p> All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p> Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p> PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p> PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p> Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p> Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p> PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p> Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p> PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p> PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p> The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p> PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p> PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p> Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p> We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p> PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p> PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p> Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p> And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p> We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p> And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p> Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p> It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p> The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p> So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p> Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p> But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p> This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p> ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p> The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p> We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p> There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p> The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p> HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p> ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p> So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p> So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p> Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p> Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p> HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p> And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p> HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p> HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p> Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p> I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p> And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p> Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p> The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p> Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p> And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p> And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p> So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p> We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p> The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p> Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p> Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p> Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p> For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p> Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p> Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p> Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p> Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p> All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p> PETE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p> BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p> The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p> We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p> Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p> Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p> And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p> HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p> Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p> But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p> And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p> But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p> You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p> What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p> I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p> They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p> NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p> Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p> One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p> So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p> I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p> PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p> HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p> So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p> PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p> BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p> Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p> Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p> Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p> HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p> I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p> So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p> So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p> But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p> Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p> HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p> Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p> Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p> This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p> Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p> Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p> Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p> It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p> CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p> Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p> CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p> PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p> CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p> CASONE:  I know.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p> CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p> Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p> Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p> RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p> PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p> With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p> So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p> So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p> The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p> PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p> When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p> So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p> All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p> Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p> PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p> PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p> Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p> Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p> PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p> Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p> PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p> PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p> The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p> PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p> PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p> Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p> We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p> PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p> PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p> Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p> And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p> We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p> And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p> Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p> It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p> The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p> So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p> Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p> But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p> This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p> ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p> The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p> We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p> There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p> The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p> HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p> ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p> So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p> So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p> Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p> Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p> HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p> And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p> HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p> HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p> Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p> I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p> And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p> Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p> The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p> Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p> And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p> And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p> So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p> We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p> The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p> Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p> Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average both gained around 0.2 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All three major gauges had slumped in the morning, but found some momentum in the afternoon, led by a rally in the technology sector.</p><p>\"It's a bit of a carryover from Friday, where stocks fell in the morning, and then recovered in the afternoon,\" said Chris Johnson, market strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research.</p><p>\"The Nasdaq was hit harder than the other averages last week,\" he added, \"so you're seeing that bounce the most today, even in the wake of the Dell news.\"</p><p>Discouraging corporate news from Dell had sent stocks lower in the morning. Worries about the economy in the wake of a big selloff in commodities had added to the selling.</p><p>Such concerns are unlikely to disappear at the start of what is likely to be a very choppy week for stocks.</p><p>\"I would expect a lot of volatility this week because you have a tremendous amount of important economic numbers coming out,\" said Barry Hyman, equity strategist at EKN Financial Services.</p><p>Reports include Tuesday's trade balance data; retail sales and business inventories on Thursday; and consumer prices and manufacturing on Friday.</p><p>Investors will be scouring the reports for clarity regarding the economy, specifically whether it is still growing, but not so much so as to push up inflationary pressures.</p><p>Stocks rallied Friday after a choppy start to September, as investors welcomed falling oil prices and soothing comments from a Federal Reserve official regarding inflation and interest rates.</p><p>In other news, Monday marks the five-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. (Full story).</p><p>Among the industries hurt by the attacks, five years later, airlines still struggle. (Full story).</p><p>Dell and other movers</p><p>Dell said it would delay filing its quarterly results after a Securities and Exchange Commission probe revealed possible accounting errors in prior quarters. The PC maker also said that because of these developments, it would suspend its share buyback program. Dell shares lost 1 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Europe's regulatory arm is looking into whether Intelencouraged Europe's largest electronics retailer not to sell computers that use chips made by its rival, Advanced Micro Devices. The probe was an extension of an ongoing investigation into Intelthat began in 2001.</p><p>Intelshares were little changed after falling in the morning.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard's board of directors held an emergency meeting over the weekend, yet no news has emerged on whether embattled chairwoman Patricia Dunn will be asked to resign. Dunn has been under criticism for her role in an internal probe of HP's board that allegedly used illegal methods to spy on directors and some journalists.</p><p>HP shares inched higher.</p><p>But other big tech shares gained, with Oracle, JDS Uniphase and Nortel Networks all rising.</p><p>Freescale Semiconductor jumped 20 percent and topped the New York Stock Exchange's most-actives list on news that two private equity groups are looking to buy the company for about $16 billion.</p><p>Market breadth was mixed. On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners barely edged advancers on volume of 1.11 billion shares.

With the California Legislature in the final three weeks of its session, big tech companies and business lobbies have so far had little success in getting changes to the California Consumer Privacy Act[1]. The landmark online privacy law - enacted in summer 2018 - takes effect Jan. </p><p>1, 2020. The law parallels a sweeping measure[2] adopted by the European Union that took effect in May 2018. It gives consumers the right to know who is collecting what data on them from their online browsing and provides them the choice of opting out from collection. Defenders of the state law say the reason it has been targeted so vigorously is because tech firms know that California often influences what other states or even Congress does. These companies prefer the present anything-goes data accumulation landscape allowed under federal law. The Golden State law did appear to inspire 24 states to consider online privacy laws this year, according to Pew's Stateline[3] research site, though few have been enacted so far.Critics: Flaws will hurt bottom lines, customersBut critics say they are going after the law because it is poorly crafted and could both drive companies out of business and reduce the ways that online information gathering actually helps consumers by connecting them to goods and services they are likely to want. Among the criticisms offered by the California Chamber of Commerce and the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business: The limits put on what 'personal information' can be gathered are so broadly written that they apply to broad swaths of information that can't be linked to individuals but that can help businesses develop marketing strategies. The provision banning businesses from the sale of information gathered online is so broad it will make it difficult for businesses to use information that it has gathered directly and legitimately from use of their websites to determine what customized content to provide customers. Legislation that would address these concerns has not advanced.Local agencies fear effect on public health, tax collectionThe Bay Area News Group also reported[4] on the failure of a bill that would have allowed government agencies to have access to consumer information for a variety of priorities, including helping government officials 'to collect child support, find people exposed to infectious diseases, locate foster children's family members, determine social service eligibility, and collect delinquent taxes and judgments.' One measure - Assembly Bill 25[5] by Assemblyman Ed Chau, D-Monterey Park - has made progress. It would make clear that the law doesn't cover employees acting within the scope of their basic job duties. As a co-sponsor of the original law, Chau had more credibility than some of the lawmakers' who appeared to be proposing changes at the tech industry's behest. AB25 passed the Assembly on a 77-0 vote[6] in May and an amended version was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 8-0 vote last month. But it has not been considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee since its referral. Dramatic late-session moves could resurrect some of the more controversial bills seeking to narrow the Consumer Privacy Act. But an official with the Electronic Frontier Foundation told the Bay Area News Group that come Jan. 1, the foundation expected that 'the same bill [adopted last year] goes into effect.'Why focus is likely to shift from Sacramento to AlbanyThe tech companies and lobbying groups could soon shift their attention from California, the richest state in terms of GDP, to New York, the third richest. In 2020, lawmakers there are expected to consider perhaps the most far-reaching[7] online privacy law in the world. One likely provision would make it a 'fiduciary duty' for companies to use the data they accumulate in ways that advance the customer's best interests.

With the California Legislature in the final three weeks of its session, big tech companies and business lobbies have so far had little success in getting changes to the California Consumer Privacy Act[1]. The landmark online privacy law - enacted in summer 2018 - takes effect Jan. </p><p>1, 2020. The law parallels a sweeping measure[2] adopted by the European Union that took effect in May 2018. It gives consumers the right to know who is collecting what data on them from their online browsing and provides them the choice of opting out from collection. Defenders of the state law say the reason it has been targeted so vigorously is because tech firms know that California often influences what other states or even Congress does. These companies prefer the present anything-goes data accumulation landscape allowed under federal law. The Golden State law did appear to inspire 24 states to consider online privacy laws this year, according to Pew's Stateline[3] research site, though few have been enacted so far.Critics: Flaws will hurt bottom lines, customersBut critics say they are going after the law because it is poorly crafted and could both drive companies out of business and reduce the ways that online information gathering actually helps consumers by connecting them to goods and services they are likely to want. Among the criticisms offered by the California Chamber of Commerce and the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business: The limits put on what 'personal information' can be gathered are so broadly written that they apply to broad swaths of information that can't be linked to individuals but that can help businesses develop marketing strategies. The provision banning businesses from the sale of information gathered online is so broad it will make it difficult for businesses to use information that it has gathered directly and legitimately from use of their websites to determine what customized content to provide customers. Legislation that would address these concerns has not advanced.Local agencies fear effect on public health, tax collectionThe Bay Area News Group also reported[4] on the failure of a bill that would have allowed government agencies to have access to consumer information for a variety of priorities, including helping government officials 'to collect child support, find people exposed to infectious diseases, locate foster children's family members, determine social service eligibility, and collect delinquent taxes and judgments.' One measure - Assembly Bill 25[5] by Assemblyman Ed Chau, D-Monterey Park - has made progress. It would make clear that the law doesn't cover employees acting within the scope of their basic job duties. As a co-sponsor of the original law, Chau had more credibility than some of the lawmakers' who appeared to be proposing changes at the tech industry's behest. AB25 passed the Assembly on a 77-0 vote[6] in May and an amended version was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 8-0 vote last month. But it has not been considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee since its referral. Dramatic late-session moves could resurrect some of the more controversial bills seeking to narrow the Consumer Privacy Act. But an official with the Electronic Frontier Foundation told the Bay Area News Group that come Jan. 1, the foundation expected that 'the same bill [adopted last year] goes into effect.'Why focus is likely to shift from Sacramento to AlbanyThe tech companies and lobbying groups could soon shift their attention from California, the richest state in terms of GDP, to New York, the third richest. In 2020, lawmakers there are expected to consider perhaps the most far-reaching[7] online privacy law in the world. One likely provision would make it a 'fiduciary duty' for companies to use the data they accumulate in ways that advance the customer's best interests. Depending on how this is interpreted, this could mean the end of the present model of micro-targeting of consumers through information gained from their online searches and activity - at least in New York state.

They also make sure their voices are heard through lobbying the House, Senate, White House and federal agencies.And 2018 proved to be another big year for lobbying, especially for internet companies. It's easy to see why. Besides intense scrutiny from federal regulators for facilitating Russian interference in the U.S. elections, they faced criticism for their handling of personal data, complaints that they are biased against conservatives and calls to hike the local taxes they pay.Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG[1]) Google spent the most of any other tech company in the country, according to OpenSecrets. </p><p>Its total expenditure for the year wasan eye-popping $21.74 million. Investopedia  Google's reach extended to every manner of policy decision. Last year, it lobbied on bills related to political ads, music licensing, autonomous vehicles, drones, green cards, data privacy, government surveillance, human trafficking, patent reform, corporate tax reform, the H-1B temporary worker visa[2], Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), cybersecurity and the opioid crisis.Internet companies Google, Facebook Inc. (FB[3]),Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[4]), Twitter Inc. (TWTR[5]), Alibaba Group (BABA[6]) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM[7]) spent record amounts last year to influence the government. Altogether, internet companies spent $77.2 million last year, up from $68.61 million in 2017. Over 60% of this was by the top three spenders \u2014 Google, Amazon and Facebook.There was a slight drop in how much electronics companies that develop software and hardware computer technologies spent. The total for this industry fell from $147.33 million in 2017 to $144.8 million in 2018.Microsoft Corp. (MSFT[8]), Samsung Electronics America, Intel Corp. (INTC[9]), Siemens AG and Dell Technologies were the only top spending companies (above $3 million) in this category to increase their budgets last year. Oracle Corp. (ORCL[10]) and Apple Inc. (AAPL[11]) spent record amounts in 2017 but did not loosen their purse strings again for 2018. Biggest Spenders Both Google and Amazon stepped up lobbying on transportation in 2018 and focused on bills that would establish a federal framework for autonomous vehicles and provide regulatory relief. Google even visited a skeptical Sen. Dianne Feinstein[12] in Washington D.C. last year to pitch her on self-driving technology, according to Recode[13]. It was ultimately a failed effort[14].The companies saw more success with the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which was signed into law in October 2018 and paves the way for drone delivery.\"Taxes\" continued to get manymentions in Amazon's lobbying reports after several attacks from President Trump on the matter. In 2017, the company caved and began collecting sales taxes in all states that have them, but this is only on goods sold directly by Amazon. Ironically,Amazon supports bills that would authorize states to require remote sellers to collect taxes and spent lobbying dollars to push for them to be passed. It's possible the firm realizes that collecting state sales taxes will make things significantly harder for its smaller online competitors. So contrary to what Trump says, Amazon does support internet taxes.Similarly, Amazon also lobbied for the federal minimum wage to be increased after it raised its own minimum wage, leading some to believe this was another strategy to hurt its competitors.Trump has also said the United States Postal Service charges the firm too little, and included in Amazon's lobbying reports are \"issues related to postal reform and postal rates including the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017 (H.R. 756).\"Pervasive in Google's lobbying filings arementions ofcompetition and antitrust issues, while Facebook, which was hit by massive data breaches and revealed data-sharing partnerships with Chinese firms, focused most on \"platform integrity\" and \"issues related to data security, transparency and disclosures.\"Both Google and Facebook also lobbied the government on the Honest Ads Act that would bring more transparency to political advertising on online platforms if passed.Tech companies have continued fighting the government on surveillance issues, especially government requests for data. Google has been a strong supporter of theEmail Privacy Act(H.R. 387), a bill introduced inJanuary 2017 that would require the government to gain a warrant before requesting access to private emails. The bill was also lobbied for by Twitter and Facebook. Lobbying reports of Google and Facebook also mention the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for warrantless surveillance by the NSA and was reauthorized in January 2018.While Facebook wants to curbgovernment surveillance, it is actively fighting at the same time to protect its own access to user information. The company is lobbying against the BROWSER Act, which would require it to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of the use, disclosure or access to sensitive data.It also lobbied on the threatening Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 that would allow newspaper companies to negotiate \"fair terms that would flow earned subscription and advertising dollars back to the publishers, while protecting and preserving Americans' right to access quality news.\" Public Enemy Asthe current administration takes away or threatens to take away things Big Tech holds dear,likenet neutrality[15],visas[16]andinternet privacy,and Congress members draw up bills to force companies to take responsibility and be held accountable for misleading political ads and privacy violations, the industry is rapidly losing the perception game. AsBuzzfeed[17]cautioned, Big Tech now has powerful people on both ends of the political spectrum thinking it needs reining in.While the leaders in the industry were once celebrated as noble and forward-thinking powerhouses,experts now worry tech giantsare monopolies unconscionably profiting as they harm everything from the the arts to small businesses, human relationships anddemocracy.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, recently published a Medium post[18] in which she advocated for \"breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.\" She wrote, \"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.\"Criticism is also emanating from the industry itself. Salesforce (CRM[19]) CEO Marc Benioff wants Facebook to be regulated like a tobacco company because of its addictive nature. A former employee said the company can't be trusted to regulate itself in a New York Times op-ed. A former Apple executive andtwo investorswant the company to be more proactive aboutpreventing user addiction.

Tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are being accused of a wide variety of sins: promulgating fake news, stifling innovative competitors, and crushing mom-and-pop shops, to name a few. Some critics have gone so far as to call for these powerful companies to be converted into public utilities. Others want the government to use its antitrust powers to break up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This borders on the absurd.</p><p>For the past half-century, the U.S. government has followed the best standard that economists and legal scholars have come up with to define anticompetitive behavior: Are these companies threatening or reducing the welfare of consumers as determined by the prices, quality of products and services, and choices consumers face and the benefits of economic innovation consumers enjoy?</p><p>This is the right standard. Another standard that could be used in antitrust enforcement is essentially \u201cbig is bad\u201d \u2014 the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of the political and economic influence they wield.</p><p>This vague, fuzzier standard is inferior. It ignores the good things that come from size, including the ability to produce output at lower cost. It also invites regulatory mischief. And it weakens the focus on the benefits competitive markets offer to consumers.</p><p>By the standard of consumer welfare, big tech is a blessing. I have been using Gmail every day for more than a decade. It operates flawlessly. And its search feature is so good that it acts as a virtual diary, allowing me to revisit correspondence from years ago with just a few keystrokes. Google, the creator and operator of Gmail, has charged me zero dollars for this fantastic product. Amazon is pushing prices so low that some believe it is reducing the rate of price inflation for the overall economy. Apple put a sleek computer \u2014 and the ability to access previously unimaginable quantities of knowledge \u2014 in our pockets.</p><p>In short, by the standards of consumer welfare \u2014 providing a variety of high-quality products, innovation, low prices \u2014 big tech is one of the best things to happen in the economy in decades.</p><p>A more subtle argument against big tech involves the future: Yes, many new and innovative products are given away free today. But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow\u2019s prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that would lead to innovation or lower prices tomorrow. I\u2019m not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had more competition.</p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the average American\u2019s choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, the decline of America Online, that many speculate Apple\u2019s ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \u201cis losing its teenage users\u201d because \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 \u201cparents killed it.\u201d</p><p>In other words: These companies haven\u2019t been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn\u2019t assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation \u2014 Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram and Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube, as examples. But it\u2019s just as possible that the opportunity for an entrepreneur to create something great and sell it to big tech encourages more innovation than it suppresses. And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that Amazon\u2019s master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales \u2014 including groceries \u2014 by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait</p><p>until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition. Online sales make up less than 10 percent of all retail sales. Walmart\u2019s revenue is more than twice Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s not time to call in the trust busters.</p><p>This is not to say that big tech is without concern. There is a conversation to be had about the influence social media companies such as Facebook have on the public debate and in our political system. Its guiding light must be the preservation of free speech. But issues like the role of bots, the hosting of political content and the amount of responsibility Facebook has over the content on its platform should be discussed.

Tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are being accused of a wide variety of sins: promulgating fake news, stifling innovative competitors, and crushing mom-and-pop shops, to name a few. Some critics have gone so far as to call for these powerful companies to be converted into public utilities. Others want the government to use its antitrust powers to break up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This borders on the absurd.</p><p>For the past half-century, the U.S. government has followed the best standard that economists and legal scholars have come up with to define anticompetitive behavior: Are these companies threatening or reducing the welfare of consumers as determined by the prices, quality of products and services, and choices consumers face and the benefits of economic innovation consumers enjoy?</p><p>This is the right standard. Another standard that could be used in antitrust enforcement is essentially \u201cbig is bad\u201d \u2014 the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of the political and economic influence they wield.</p><p>This vague, fuzzier standard is inferior. It ignores the good things that come from size, including the ability to produce output at lower cost. It also invites regulatory mischief. And it weakens the focus on the benefits competitive markets offer to consumers.</p><p>By the standard of consumer welfare, big tech is a blessing. I have been using Gmail every day for more than a decade. It operates flawlessly. And its search feature is so good that it acts as a virtual diary, allowing me to revisit correspondence from years ago with just a few keystrokes. Google, the creator and operator of Gmail, has charged me zero dollars for this fantastic product. Amazon is pushing prices so low that some believe it is reducing the rate of price inflation for the overall economy. Apple put a sleek computer \u2014 and the ability to access previously unimaginable quantities of knowledge \u2014 in our pockets.</p><p>In short, by the standards of consumer welfare \u2014 providing a variety of high-quality products, innovation, low prices \u2014 big tech is one of the best things to happen in the economy in decades.</p><p>A more subtle argument against big tech involves the future: Yes, many new and innovative products are given away free today. But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow\u2019s prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that would lead to innovation or lower prices tomorrow. I\u2019m not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had more competition.</p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the average American\u2019s choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, the decline of America Online, that many speculate Apple\u2019s ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \u201cis losing its teenage users\u201d because \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 \u201cparents killed it.\u201d</p><p>In other words: These companies haven\u2019t been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn\u2019t assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation \u2014 Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram and Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube, as examples.

And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that Amazon\u2019s master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales \u2014 including groceries \u2014 by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait</p><p>until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition.

Tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are being accused of a wide variety of sins: promulgating fake news, stifling innovative competitors, and crushing mom-and-pop shops, to name a few. Some critics have gone so far as to call for these powerful companies to be converted into public utilities. Others want the government to use its antitrust powers to break up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This borders on the absurd.</p><p>For the past half-century, the U.S. government has followed the best standard that economists and legal scholars have come up with to define anticompetitive behavior: Are these companies threatening or reducing the welfare of consumers as determined by the prices, quality of products and services, and choices consumers face and the benefits of economic innovation consumers enjoy?</p><p>This is the right standard. Another standard that could be used in antitrust enforcement is essentially \u201cbig is bad\u201d \u2014 the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of the political and economic influence they wield.</p><p>This vague, fuzzier standard is inferior. It ignores the good things that come from size, including the ability to produce output at lower cost. It also invites regulatory mischief. And it weakens the focus on the benefits competitive markets offer to consumers.</p><p>By the standard of consumer welfare, big tech is a blessing. I have been using Gmail every day for more than a decade. It operates flawlessly. And its search feature is so good that it acts as a virtual diary, allowing me to revisit correspondence from years ago with just a few keystrokes. Google, the creator and operator of Gmail, has charged me zero dollars for this fantastic product. Amazon is pushing prices so low that some believe it is reducing the rate of price inflation for the overall economy. Apple put a sleek computer \u2014 and the ability to access previously unimaginable quantities of knowledge \u2014 in our pockets.</p><p>In short, by the standards of consumer welfare \u2014 providing a variety of high-quality products, innovation, low prices \u2014 big tech is one of the best things to happen in the economy in decades.</p><p>A more subtle argument against big tech involves the future: Yes, many new and innovative products are given away free today. But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow\u2019s prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that would lead to innovation or lower prices tomorrow. I\u2019m not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had more competition.</p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the average American\u2019s choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, the decline of America Online, that many speculate Apple\u2019s ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \u201cis losing its teenage users\u201d because \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 \u201cparents killed it.\u201d</p><p>In other words: These companies haven\u2019t been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn\u2019t assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation \u2014 Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram and Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube, as examples. But it\u2019s just as possible that the opportunity for an entrepreneur to create something great and sell it to big tech encourages more innovation than it suppresses. And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that Amazon\u2019s master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales \u2014 including groceries \u2014 by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait</p><p>until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition. Online sales make up less than 10 percent of all retail sales. Walmart\u2019s revenue is more than twice Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s not time to call in the trust busters.</p><p>This is not to say that big tech is without concern. There is a conversation to be had about the influence social media companies such as Facebook have on the public debate and in our political system. Its guiding light must be the preservation of free speech. But issues like the role of bots, the hosting of political content and the amount of responsibility Facebook has over the content on its platform should be discussed. In addition, it is reasonable to be concerned about consumer ownership of social network data and search and purchasing histories, and about data security.</p><p>But break up big tech? No. That would shatter some of the greatest achievements of the American economy.</p><p>\u2014 Strain is director of economic policy studies and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are being accused of a wide variety of sins: promulgating fake news, stifling innovative competitors, and crushing mom-and-pop shops, to name a few. Some critics have gone so far as to call for these powerful companies to be converted into public utilities. Others want the government to use its antitrust powers to break up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This borders on the absurd.</p><p>For the past half-century, the U.S. government has followed the best standard that economists and legal scholars have come up with to define anticompetitive behavior: Are these companies threatening or reducing the welfare of consumers as determined by the prices, quality of products and services, and choices consumers face and the benefits of economic innovation consumers enjoy?</p><p>This is the right standard. Another standard that could be used in antitrust enforcement is essentially \u201cbig is bad\u201d \u2014 the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of the political and economic influence they wield.</p><p>This vague, fuzzier standard is inferior. It ignores the good things that come from size, including the ability to produce output at lower cost. It also invites regulatory mischief. And it weakens the focus on the benefits competitive markets offer to consumers.</p><p>By the standard of consumer welfare, big tech is a blessing. I have been using Gmail every day for more than a decade. It operates flawlessly. And its search feature is so good that it acts as a virtual diary, allowing me to revisit correspondence from years ago with just a few keystrokes. Google, the creator and operator of Gmail, has charged me zero dollars for this fantastic product. Amazon is pushing prices so low that some believe it is reducing the rate of price inflation for the overall economy. Apple put a sleek computer \u2014 and the ability to access previously unimaginable quantities of knowledge \u2014 in our pockets.</p><p>In short, by the standards of consumer welfare \u2014 providing a variety of high-quality products, innovation, low prices \u2014 big tech is one of the best things to happen in the economy in decades.</p><p>A more subtle argument against big tech involves the future: Yes, many new and innovative products are given away free today. But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow\u2019s prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that would lead to innovation or lower prices tomorrow. I\u2019m not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had more competition.</p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the average American\u2019s choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, the decline of America Online, that many speculate Apple\u2019s ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \u201cis losing its teenage users\u201d because \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 \u201cparents killed it.\u201d</p><p>In other words: These companies haven\u2019t been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn\u2019t assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation \u2014 Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram and Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube, as examples. But it\u2019s just as possible that the opportunity for an entrepreneur to create something great and sell it to big tech encourages more innovation than it suppresses. And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that Amazon\u2019s master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales \u2014 including groceries \u2014 by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait</p><p>until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition. Online sales make up less than 10 percent of all retail sales. Walmart\u2019s revenue is more than twice Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s not time to call in the trust busters.</p><p>This is not to say that big tech is without concern. There is a conversation to be had about the influence social media companies such as Facebook have on the public debate and in our political system. Its guiding light must be the preservation of free speech. But issues like the role of bots, the hosting of political content and the amount of responsibility Facebook has over the content on its platform should be discussed. In addition, it is reasonable to be concerned about consumer ownership of social network data and search and purchasing histories, and about data security.</p><p>But break up big tech? No. That would shatter some of the greatest achievements of the American economy.</p><p>\u2014 Strain is director of economic policy studies and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow\u2019s prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that would lead to innovation or lower prices tomorrow. I\u2019m not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had more competition.</p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the average American\u2019s choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, the decline of America Online, that many speculate Apple\u2019s ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \u201cis losing its teenage users\u201d because \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 \u201cparents killed it.\u201d</p><p>In other words: These companies haven\u2019t been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn\u2019t assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation \u2014 Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram and Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube, as examples. But it\u2019s just as possible that the opportunity for an entrepreneur to create something great and sell it to big tech encourages more innovation than it suppresses. And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that Amazon\u2019s master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales \u2014 including groceries \u2014 by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait</p><p>until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition. Online sales make up less than 10 percent of all retail sales. Walmart\u2019s revenue is more than twice Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s not time to call in the trust busters.</p><p>This is not to say that big tech is without concern. There is a conversation to be had about the influence social media companies such as Facebook have on the public debate and in our political system. Its guiding light must be the preservation of free speech. But issues like the role of bots, the hosting of political content and the amount of responsibility Facebook has over the content on its platform should be discussed. In addition, it is reasonable to be concerned about consumer ownership of social network data and search and purchasing histories, and about data security.</p><p>But break up big tech? No. That would shatter some of the greatest achievements of the American economy.</p><p>\u2014 Strain is director of economic policy studies and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Pradeep Dwivedi, CEO-India, Eros InternationalMedia Limited, talks about impact this convergence will have on the Indian Media &amp; Entertainment landscape and the new business models that it is likely to empower. <br/><br/>What's your view on the big technology companies acquiring stake in Indian telecom majors, and how do you think it will change the Indian media and entertainment landscape?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The convergence that has been predicted between telecom-media-technology(TMT) is now finally coming to the fruition. The value that the consumer gets is an amalgamation of all the three. For big companies that are well funded, the idea is that if they can extract revenues and market share and share of mind by actively participating in more than one part of the convergence chain, they gain a lot. So clearly a technology company which is well funded would then want to get into the content, distribution and even handset side of the ecosystem. So clearly the motives are financial integration of the value chain.</p><p>In the Indian context, there are large population opportunities which are now becoming internet savvy and hence telecom and mobile ecosystem is coming under a lot of interest. So from a technology and market perspective, India with around 1.4 billion population becomes a lucrative market for US based technology giants. The series of investments that private equity majors are doing in Reliance Jio is an indication about the market attractiveness, technology readiness and more importantly consumer willingness to pay for content.</p><p>What is your view on the advantages these tech majors will bring in when they collaborate with Indian telecom companies?</p><p>The telecom companies have access to consumers, so the handshake is actually happening through them and with the concept of net neutrality, telecom operators are obligated to provide equivalent services to the consumer. The advantage that some of these platforms bring by partnering with telecoms is that they will be able to get a better understanding of the customer. And depending on usage patterns, demographics, the geographical dispersion of the audiences they can define and customize better products to appeal to those audiences.</p><p>For example, Facebook's investment into WhatsApp was largely around capturing a large ecosystem of a messaging service which was gaining popularity in the world. And clearly since WhatsApp was not running ads, Facebook had to go ahead and launch, you know WhatsApp for business, which then they could monetize in a certain way.</p><p>But beyond that, even for WhatsApp to go to the next step from just being a messaging platform to a messaging cum commerce platform, they would need to get into the digital payments ecosystem, which for whatever regulatory reasons, they could never really get it. Now the advantage of working closely with Jio is that Jio already has a Jio wallet. And I'm speculating here, but perhaps there is an opportunity for Jio and Facebook to collaborate to create a more compelling wallet feature for the audiences or the subscribers that are largely tied into the aggressive tariff plan and good quality of services of Jio on a pan country basis.</p><p>So, there is a value proposition in many segments like digital e-commerce, physical commerce, entertainment and news content consumption, where big technology companies can gain by actually riding piggyback on the telecom network.</p><p>Also, telecom companies in India are under various AGR obligations and struggling due to huge financial liability. These investments also allows them to perhaps defray and pay off some of these obligations and ensure their own survival and sustainability in the long run.</p><p>What new business models and avenues are these partnerships likely to bring up?</p><p>Clearly, the way I look at it is the sky's the limit, you know this is one of those pivotal moments where they say it's a bit of a carte blanche mandate, a white paper mandate and you can draw almost anything on top of that. Big tech majors and their desire to connect with consumers compounded by having access to the pipes that actually provides the handshake with consumers will transform and impact every sector right from healthcare, education, commerce or even banking. I can't imagine any sector which is not going to get impacted by it. <br/><br/>It also provides a brilliant opportunity for a very large startup ecosystem to flourish, because even though this combination provides a lot of vanilla services to the consumers, there will be opportunities for specialized solutions to emerge by startups.</p><p>Taking a hypothetical example of Amazon, in case it happens to tie up with any telecom major in India, there could be a startup with the ability to create a longer delivery value chain, which then feeds into the Amazon network and allows it to go beyond the that it already has in India.</p><p>There is an opportunity to disrupt a lot of existing business models, in logistics, distribution, pure play content consumption or even creating new forms of content that can be consumed by audiences in different way. For example, a news app like that of TikTok which provides 30 second bytes of news as a stream, continuously on a channel. It could be around sports, entertainment or music.</p><p>I think this decade 2020 to 2030 is actually going to transform the Indian economy into a true blue digital economy which will thrive a lot on these collaborations between technology majors, telecom players an evolving consumer segment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXMDCO-0053692310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXMDCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607N-M1B1-DXMP-K0XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365080</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 exchange4media.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>exchange4media.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Future M&amp;A activity is always hard to predict, but the trends are going in the right direction, analysts say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you look at the first two quarters of the year it was almost at decade lows, which is pretty meaningful if you consider what else happened this decade\" with the dot-com bubble bursting, says Rob Fisher, leader of PwC's tech M&amp;A services group.</p><p>\"What we saw was basically the deal volumes doubled in Q3 compared to Q2 and actually basically doubled the year to date stats.</p><p>Given the announcements we've seen over the last few months it's our expectation we will see another doubling.\"</p><p>Billion-dollar deals made a comeback in the third quarter of this year with announcements such as Xerox's $6.5 billion purchase of Affiliated Computer Services and Dell's planned acquisition of Perot Systems for $3.9 billion.</p><p>Dell's acquisition of Perot closed in the fourth quarter and Xerox-ACS is still pending and so they are not included in the third-quarter figure. Another pending deal that could boost the stats is Oracle's $7.4 billion purchase of Sun, which is being reviewed by European regulators.\u00a0 A shortage of M&amp;A activity as well as a slowdown in the IPO market has made it difficult for new technology companies to secure venture capital funding, because investors are wary of putting money into new companies when they haven't received liquidity on prior investments. Michael Fitzgerald, founder and managing general partner of Commonwealth Capital Ventures in Massachusetts, has predicted that the venture capital industry will continue to shrink dramatically over the next three to five years.</p><p>But as long as the stock market doesn't crash again, the tech industry should see healthy levels of acquisitions and IPOs in 2010, says Robert Armstrong, a financial analyst and senior columnist at Dow Jones Investment Banker.</p><p>\"There's been a pretty torrid pace of tech deals in the second half of 2009,\" Armstrong says. \"Even if the stock market can just bumble along where it is, I think M&amp;A will continue apace.\"</p><p>As the market stabilizes, it's easier to determine a fair price for an acquisition, Fitzgerald says.</p><p>\"2009 was kind of an odd year because the macroeconomic environment was so uncertain,\" Fitzgerald says. \"The uncertainty and instability is always a problem when you think about making big decisions about mergers and acquisitions. A degree of stability next year should definitely help.\"</p><p>Many small start-ups that were nearly ready for an IPO but did not go public because of economic conditions are likely to take the plunge in the first half of 2010, according to Armstrong. This in turn will drive further M&amp;A activity as big companies go for takeovers to pre-empt the IPOs, he says.</p><p>One of the next logical questions is which types of tech companies will do the buying in 2010, and what types of companies will they take over.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are potentially hot properties in the social networking industry. Creating financial value in Facebook and Twitter will be a challenge, however, and therefore the list of companies willing to shell out big bucks for the sites is limited, Armstrong said. Armstrong believes LinkedIn may have more value to potential acquirers because the site is built around a quite significant type of transaction - the hiring of new employees.</p><p>\"Paying a billion or so dollars for Twitter would just be madness,\" Armstrong says.</p><p>In the enterprise market, Xerox-ACS, Dell-Perot and HP-EDS are examples of big tech vendors buying services firms, part of a trend in which IT vendors are seeking to become one-stop-shopping destinations. Oracle, a software company, is attempting to buy Sun, a hardware company, and HP is trying to become more like Cisco by purchasing switch and router vendor 3Com.</p><p>The convergence of historically segregated markets like networking, storage and server technologies, and convergence of hardware with software and services, is likely to trigger further acquisitions, Fisher says. Customers are demanding better pricing and vendor and product consolidation, putting the squeeze on pure-play vendors competing against larger, diversified product and service providers, he says.</p><p>Trying to predict unpredictable events like mergers and acquisitions \"is a great way to make yourself look stupid,\" Armstrong says, noting that analyst forecasts often turn out to be wrong. Many of the big vendors don't have an obvious need for a giant transaction along the lines of Oracle-Sun, so it's hard to say which companies are likely to pull off a blockbuster deal, he said.\"Does Cisco need to buy anything now? No. Does HP? No. Does IBM? No. They might be opportunistic and snap up something small, but they all have big, complete portfolios. There's nothing that screams out 'how can they compete without X'?\" Armstrong says.</p><p>Still, there are interesting cases like Juniper. Many of Juniper's investors would likely be happy if Cisco bought the company, but assuming that doesn't happen perhaps Juniper would bulk up itself by taking over competitors Riverbed, F5 or Blue Coat, he says.</p><p>More broadly, interest in healthcare IT and the desire of tech companies to expand market presence in China are factors likely to create more M&amp;A activity, Armstrong says.</p><p>Ultimately, the downturn in 2009 will just be seen as a temporary interruption of a longer-term trend toward industry consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, Fisher says.</p><p>\"Our perspective is this is basically the continuation of what's been a five-year trend in which the technology industry in general, which is consolidation,\" he says. \"We view that as having been interrupted by the recession. At least in the last two quarters, that consolidation wave has reignited and we're seeing increases in activity and overall deal volumes and values as a result. In a broad sense, we no reason to expect that won't continue.\"</p><p>Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWW-694595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWW2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7X9P-SNC0-Y9NM-5001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8090</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1104\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Network World, Inc.

They felt Apple could not survive without Mr Jobs' charisma and innovative mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> However, Mr Cook steered Apple to greater heights with subsequent releases of the iPhone and the successful launch of the Apple Watch - the first post-Jobs new product line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In August last year, Apple became the first public company from the United States to be worth more than US$1 trillion (S$ 1.36 trillion).</p><p>  In 2013, global digital camera shipments dropped by a staggering 36 per cent from the year before, according to figures by industry trade group Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association (Cipa).</p><p> This was the sharpest decline since camera shipments peaked in 2010 at 121.5 million units. In 2013, there were 62.8 million units shipped.</p><p> The start of this decline coincided with Apple releasing the iPhone 4s in 2011. The smartphone has an 8-megapixel camera capable of capturing decent shots.</p><p> Since then, the smartphone camera has improved by leaps and bounds and multi-lens camera systems are now the norm in smartphones.</p><p> Last year, only 19.4 million digital cameras were shipped, according to Cipa. This means the digital camera industry has lost more than 80 per cent of its worth since 2010. This trend is expected to continue into the next decade.</p><p>  Despite naysayers predicting its flop, the Apple Watch (above right) - launched in April 2015 - turned out to be the best-selling smartwatch, due to its premium design, ease of use and health features such as a electrocardiogram function. There are numerous stories of how the function has helped save lives.</p><p> It also helped Apple gain a foothold in not only the smartwatch market, but also the entire wristwatch market.</p><p>Apple does not reveal the exact sales figures of the Apple Watch.</p><p> However, in September 2017, Apple CEO Mr Cook said during the launch of the iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3 that Apple has become the No. 1 watch-maker in the world, beating the likes of industry giants Rolex and Omega.</p><p> Research firm Strategy Analytics estimated 22.5 million Apple Watches were shipped last year.</p><p> According to the Swiss watch-maker association, the entire Swiss watch industry shipped 23.7 million units during the same period.</p><p>  Uber officially launched its ride-hailing service in San Francisco in July 2010. It was soon served with a cease-and-desist order by the city.</p><p> But that did not stop the start-up, which launched in cities around the world.</p><p> It also ventured into food delivery in 2014. Despite attracting controversy for its questionable business tactics, Uber kept expanding and went public this year for US$82.4 billion (S$111 billion).</p><p> Uber has reported a profit only once - last year - after selling its South-east Asian business to rival Grab, but it has undoubtedly changed the face of transportation.</p><p>  Mr Satya Nadella became the chief executive of Microsoft in 2014.</p><p> At that time, the tech giant was increasingly seen as washed-up and stagnant, eclipsed by Apple and Google.</p><p> By doubling down on cloud, embracing open source and working with competitors, Mr Nadella transformed the perception of Microsoft from aggressive monopolist to enlightened collaborator.</p><p> Under his watch, Microsoft became the world's most valuable company from July to October this year, with a market capitalisation of more than US$1 trillion.</p><p>  In 2016, AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by Google-owned AI firm DeepMind, beat 18-time Go world champion Lee Sedol by four games to one.</p><p> It was the first time a machine had beaten a human in Go, a game believed to be too complex for AI programs then.</p><p> But AlphaGo used a novel blend of AI techniques (deep learning and reinforcement learning) to master the game, improving itself by playing itself.</p><p> The success of AlphaGo brought even more attention to AI and its potential application in fields such as medicine and finance.</p><p> By the end of the decade, many countries, including Singapore, would be racing to develop their AI expertise.</p><p>  News broke last year that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which did work for the Donald Trump election campaign in the United States, had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users worldwide, including more than 65,000 users in Singapore.</p><p> The fallout: calls to boycott Facebook, its share prices tumbled and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg was summoned to testify to the US Congress.</p><p>Facebook was fined US$5 billion in July this year. More importantly, the scandal drew attention to the role of social media in influencing elections as well as the data collection practices of big-tech firms.</p><p> Wary governments are beginning to examine ways to regulate these tech firms.</p><p>  Early in the decade, players were hungry for new gaming consoles, with the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 having stayed mostly unchanged for more than seven years.</p><p> In 2013, Sony and Microsoft at last released their new consoles, packing in exclusive features each company thought would best appeal to customers.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox One had a focus on entertainment, including the ability to multitask, by snapping applications such as Skype and Internet Explorer to the side of the screen.</p><p> Meanwhile, Sony prioritised social interaction on its PlayStation 4, by giving the console the ability to record and share gameplay videos.</p><p> Furthermore, it priced its console US$100 cheaper than the Xbox One.</p><p> Both consoles have done well through the decade, but many would say their time is over.</p><p> Gamers are eagerly anticipating a new console war that will see Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X go head to head next year.</p><p>Amazon unveiled in 2014 the Echo smart speaker, which popularised the use of voice assistants powered by artificial intelligence.</p><p> With a simple voice command to the speaker, Amazon's assistant Alexa can help users switch off the room lights, set an alarm, play music, add items to their online shopping cart or forecast the weather, among a slew of other things.</p><p> Alexa can even tell a joke.</p><p> Users today have a whole host of smart speakers to choose from, such as the Google Home, Apple HomePod or Alibaba's Tmall Genie.</p><p> But the convenience comes with a trade-off - there have been reports of privacy concerns, such as last year, when thousands of private voice-recording files of an Alexa user were accidentally shared with another Alexa user he did not know.</p><p>  The digital music format MP3 and file-sharing software Napster marked the decline of physical CD sales in the 1990s.</p><p> Piracy was reaching new heights and even Apple's launch of the iTunes store in 2003 could not save the music industry, which struggled to monetise a new digital medium.</p><p> Three years later in Sweden, Spotify was developed. But it was not until July 2011 that the music-streaming software and service launched in the United States.</p><p> Wary music labels signed licensing deals and the era of music streaming was born.</p><p> In the third quarter of this year, Spotify said it had 248 million total monthly active users.</p><p> With 113 million premium subscribers, Spotify has learnt to monetise digital music - offering an advertisement-supported free plan with limited song skips, alongside an advertisement-free paid subscription plan.</p><p> What is next for the company'</p><p> With Apple Music, Tidal and Google's new YouTube Music wanting a piece of the streaming pie, Spotify's recent purchases seem to point to a future in creating original podcasts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-647422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTN-6PS1-DYX4-01Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It's not that Apple Inc. or Facebook Inc. didn't give a fig before. It's just that they've come to realize that people doubt their sincerity when it comes to industry slogans like \"Don't be evil.\"  </p><p><br/><br/>All the main players face questions about whether they harm democracy, people's health, fair competition, economic equality and privacy. This has been front-page news throughout this year and a hot topic in business circles and among politicians.<br/><br/>It makes sense, then, that tech companies are concerned. And that's showing up in varying degrees with charm offensives and less public attempts at molding the perception of their impact on the world.<br/><br/>The most visible effort to combat tech backlash is Mark Zuckerberg's highly public tour of America, which featured Facebook's billionaire chief executive attending an African-American church in South Carolina, chatting with recovering drug addicts in Ohio and sitting on a tractor at a farm in Wisconsin.<br/><br/>I don't want to imply that Zuckerberg isn't earnest about trying to make Facebook, or his wealth, forces for good. But his quasi-presidential tour was also useful to tilt the narrative away from the escalating political and social crises faced this year by big technology companies, including his.<br/><br/>And he's not the only tech titan trying to shape his company's image for the better. Apple CEO Tim Cook is no stranger to scandals about how Apple suppliers mistreat workers or the environmental harm of smartphones.<br/><br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos used to mostly tweet about his cool personal space initiatives. Now his Twitter account is threaded with anecdotes about good works. The company has also been busy behind the scenes countering news articles that suggest it is harming other retailers, weighing down local economies or squashing competition.<br/><br/>There's less direct evidence of Google's perception campaigns, but news organizations this year have reported on ways that its parent company, Alphabet Inc., has sought to shape opinions by swaying research on its influence and backing legal scholars who support the way it uses its market power.<br/><br/>Big tech companies' feel-good campaigns are also accompanied by hard-headed lobbying in pursuit of their interests. Google has for some time been one of the savviest power brokers in Washington, although its influence may be waning. The other big U.S. technology companies are quickly learning to navigate the Beltway. Google and Amazon are among the biggest corporate spenders on federal lobbying this year, and Facebook isn't far behind, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.<br/><br/>Washington is now rethinking its relatively light-touch regulation of internet companies, and the tech companies have been working behind the scenes to counteract or reshape proposed legislation that would require more disclosure of political ads on their websites and potentially expose them to legal liability for users' digital activity.<br/><br/>It's understandable for big tech to find multiple approaches to tackle the backlash against their size, wealth and influence. Being forced to account for their rising power was the biggest industry theme of 2017, and the reckoning will continue. So these companies can't stop at talk and mythmaking. They also must persuade, with actions, that they're doing more good than harm.<br/><br/>Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist.<br/><br/>Shira Ovide<br/><br/>Columnist<br/><br/>Bloomberg  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALTMS-uscpcent02-6xxqii2ajz5xxxxgpm1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R54-W8V1-JCW9-X1V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">230747</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SCRIPPS Howard Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corpus Christi Caller-Times</publicationName><edition>1, CallerTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 11, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

This is also a significant win for TD as Canadian banks continue to solidify their rewards ecosystems and defend market share in an increasingly digital marketplace.\"</p><p>The other shot fired across the banks' bow on Tuesday was by Facebook Inc., which officially announced a plan for a new digital currency by as early as next year.</p><p>That plan - which includes an independent, not-for-profit governing entity based in Geneva, Switzerland called the Libra Association - is \"as loud an announcement of entry into Fintech as you will find,\" said Lex Sokolin, global fintech co-head at blockchain technology company ConsenSys.</p><p>\"The incumbents in the banking industry rightly stand to lose both marketshare and future market opportunity as a result of this move,\" he said in an email.</p><p>Libra, the planned cryptocurrency, is to be a \"stable currency built on a secure and stable open-source blockchain, backed by a reserve of real assets, and governed by an independent association,\" according to a white paper released by the Libra Association.</p><p>But the vision also includes \"more access to better, cheaper, and open financial services,\" and backing from companies like Mastercard and Uber Technologies Inc.</p><p>\"We believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system,\" the white paper added. \"And this approach can deliver a giant leap forward toward a lower-cost, more accessible, more connected global financial system.\"</p><p>Traditional lenders have cautiously embraced big tech, which is a significant source of customers and consumer data, but also a cause for concern due to the possibility that the banks will be elbowed aside by new players in the financial system.</p><p>There is risk to reputation as well, as big-tech companies face renewed scrutiny from governments and regulators over competition and privacy concerns.</p><p>In April, following Apple Inc.'s announcement of a credit card with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., TD president and chief executive Bharat Masrani was asked about the possibility of a similar big tech-big bank partnership. The CEO responded that partnerships are not a new thing for the bank, which is a card issuer in the U.S. for retailers Nordstrom Inc. and Target Corp.</p><p>\"Any opportunity, if they were to present themselves, we would look at it,\" Masrani told reporters following TD's annual meeting of shareholders. \"And (it) depends on which market, what's the positioning, what kind of partner do we have - because our brand is also exposed there, and that's important to us - what kind of risks are acceptable.\"</p><p>While the target of Facebook's payments plan may actually be more along the lines of Chinese financial-technology giants such as Ant Financial Services Group and its Alipay platform, Sokolin said banks may be prompted to join in the crypto-endeavour.</p><p>\"I expect that many of them, if the initiative at least appears to be successful, may want to become nodes in the network to sustain the cryptocurrency,\" he said. \"The fact that traditional financial institutions are not leading something like this, and instead it is being built by Silicon Valley, tells a powerful story about who can take advantage of frontier technology.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Times &amp;; Transcript (Moncton)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMTE-394158969MOTT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-RG91-JCT2-M3JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Times &amp; Transcript.

Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie who masterminded the Cambridge Analytica 'hack' of Facebook Photo: AFP / THOMAS SAMSON So great is their potential power over society and people's lives, that tech professionals need to be subject to the same codes of ethics as doctors and lawyers, he told AFP as his book was published in France.\"Profiling work that we were doing to look at who was most vulnerable to being radicalised... was used to identify people in the US who were susceptible to radicalisation so that they could be encouraged and catalysed on that path,\" he said. </p><p>\"You are being intentionally monitored so that your unique biases, your anxieties, your weaknesses, your needs, your desires can be quantified in such a way that a company can seek to exploit that for profit,\" said the 30-year-old. The whistleblower who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal says Facebook and other tech firms should be regulated just like the tobacco industry Photo: AFP / Kenzo TRIBOUILLARD Wylie, who blew the whistle to the British newspaper, The Guardian, in March 2018, said at least people now realise how powerful data can be.\"We are now talking about it, whereas before we weren't. For a long time I think journalists and society at large really did drink that Kool-Aid.\"They bought the message that the tech industry is good and they can do no wrong. What we're now seeing is that big tech is just like any other industry. When push comes to shove, when it affects profit, they make decisions just like an oil or tobacco company would,\" he added.Which is why regulation is urgent, argued Canadian-born Wylie.He made the comparison with the construction industry, which must conform to a plethora of norms and standards, whereas in the digital world the individual is left to protect themselves from a whole array of risks they cannot possibly hope to understand.\"Facebook is an architecture, it is a construction, it is a product of engineering. And just like any other highly-technical sector, whether it's aerospace, automobiles, energy or biotech, there are rules in place that regulate.\"Wylie also compared the \"feeling of outrage that I think a lot of Americans are feeling\" to what \"voters in Africa or in a lot of South Asian countries\" have suffered for decades at the hands of big corporations of their former colonial masters.\"There would be large businesses, or indeed countries, that would hire firms to influence elections. And the internet has made colonialism 2.0 really easy,\" he said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX10876715839235561007577610007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD7-05C1-JCMN-Y2XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><timeReceived>10:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
