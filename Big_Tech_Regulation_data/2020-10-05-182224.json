Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p>White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p>Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p>But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p>Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p>Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p>MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p>FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p>FORBES: Worries --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p>MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p>FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p>ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p>So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p>ROLLINS: There's -</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p>ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p>FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p>ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p>ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p>FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p>ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: How do you -</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p>BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p>ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p>FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p>BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p>ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p>ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p>BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p>ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p>BELL: It's not your money. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p>ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p>FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p>FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p>CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p>British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p>And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p>CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p>KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p>Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p>So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p>FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p>FORBES: They know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p>The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p>Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p>Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p>New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p>Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p>FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p>In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p>YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p>And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p>Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p>BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p>So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p>YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p>But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p>FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p>FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p>YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p>FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p>YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p>MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p>YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p>FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p>YORK: Well --</p><p>FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p>FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p>FORBES: Exactly.</p><p>YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p>BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p>YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment.

So there  is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of  June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.  Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi  Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the  movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo  Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef 'O'  Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that  also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p>Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for  the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb  recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super  fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to  find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they  did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel,  the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares  of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right,  I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it  for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise. </p><p>BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle. </p><p>FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie  star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with  Mel Gibson. We've got the details right after this. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well move over Michael Jordan, here comes Lebron.  Jared has the story right now. Hey Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. More folks saying  \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has  played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p>Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his  point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p>Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning,  before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever,  March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this  week. Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it gives us an opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP) </p><p>MAX: Yes, alll 30 MLB teams were scheduled to play today, but the Reds game  in Cincinnati against the Nationals postponed because of a rainy forecast.  They'll make it up tomorrow, first game 12:40 in Miami between the Cubs and  the Marlins. </p><p>History will be made in the NFL next season, the L.A. Rams are going to  have two male cheerleaders. While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore  Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton  Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of  the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p>Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves.  Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p>MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p>MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio. By the way, Gronk, I get to tell my one Gronk story. I saw him  wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once. </p><p>MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big  screen. </p><p>MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts --  tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still  pretty good -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p>MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p>FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in  2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\"  everyone laughed. Now they're best buddies. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow interesting, Jared, thank you. Jared Max, catch the sports  sports reports and Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius XM115.

Great to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, there is.</p><p>BELL:  A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge.  We're going  to talk about that, I know.  It will be interesting to see what the next  step has to say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then of course, the final day of the -- of the  quarter.  We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the  first quarter, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook,  let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm  going to teaser up.  Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal  has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as  care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to  borrow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get  things back to reality.  Markets been worried about what might happen.   Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  We're going to get back to what's  happening in terms of the fundamentals.  We have this breaking news, the  President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning.  I have stated  my concerns with Amazon long before the election.  Unlike others they pay  little or no taxes to state and local governments.  Use our postal system  as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United  States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business.  The  President just tweeted that about Amazon.  Now, the President is taking his  pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as  a proposal stalls out in Congress.  Adam Shapiro covering the story from  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  And a good morning to you, Maria.  The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p>And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p>Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p>FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p>FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p>FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p>FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p>Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.  But yes,  this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of  user data, interacting abuser.  So we'll let you decide on this one.   Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year. </p><p>OK.  Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving  at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start  a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours.  They're going to install  new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for  you, Maria.  We're going to keep watching.  And then finally there is this.   Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC  in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR:  And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great  again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back  episodes.  That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of  the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us.  And also  President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on  the show's early success.  Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p>BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p>FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for  years.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.  He'll  weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well.   President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more.  Stay with us for  that.  Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show.  We're  taking you there.  Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official  opening tomorrow.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula,  North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have  decided to meet on April 27th.  This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p>If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p>Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p>Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p>We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p>RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p>RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p>RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p>RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p>RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p>RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p>RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p>RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p>Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p>And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p>You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p>GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p>FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stu, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p>White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p>Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p>But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p>Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p>Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p>MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p>FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p>FORBES: Worries --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p>MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p>FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p>ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p>So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p>ROLLINS: There's -</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p>ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p>FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p>ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p>ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p>FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p>ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: How do you -</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p>BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p>ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p>FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p>BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p>ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p>ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p>BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p>ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p>BELL: It's not your money. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p>ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p>FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p>FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p>CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p>British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p>And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p>CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p>KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p>Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p>So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p>FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p>FORBES: They know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p>The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p>Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p>Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p>New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p>Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p>FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p>In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p>YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p>And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p>Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p>BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p>So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p>YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p>But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p>FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p>FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p>YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p>FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p>YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p>MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p>YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p>FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p>YORK: Well --</p><p>FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p>FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p>FORBES: Exactly.</p><p>YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p>BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p>YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment.

So there  is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of  June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.  Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi  Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the  movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo  Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef 'O'  Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that  also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p>Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for  the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb  recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super  fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to  find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they  did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel,  the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares  of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right,  I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it  for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise. </p><p>BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle. </p><p>FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie  star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with  Mel Gibson.

Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p>Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning,  before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever,  March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this  week.

Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p>MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p>MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio.

The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p>And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p>Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p>FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p>FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p>FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p>FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p>Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.  But yes,  this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of  user data, interacting abuser.  So we'll let you decide on this one.   Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year. </p><p>OK.  Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving  at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start  a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours.  They're going to install  new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for  you, Maria.  We're going to keep watching.  And then finally there is this.   Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC  in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR:  And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great  again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back  episodes.  That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of  the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us.  And also  President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on  the show's early success.  Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p>BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p>FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for  years.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.  He'll  weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well.   President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more.  Stay with us for  that.  Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show.  We're  taking you there.  Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official  opening tomorrow.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula,  North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have  decided to meet on April 27th.  This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p>If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p>Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p>Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p>We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p>RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p>RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p>RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p>RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p>RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p>RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p>RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p>RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p>Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p>And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p>You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p>GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p>FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stu, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p> Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p> White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p> Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p> And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p> Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p> FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p> BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p> We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p> BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p> BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p> BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p> BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p> FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p> FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p> BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p> BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p> FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p> FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p> FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p> And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p> Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p> Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p> And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p> JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p> ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p> FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p> BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p> And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p> By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p> BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p> FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p> FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p> FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p> FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p> Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p> And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p> Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p> Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p> And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p> And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p> In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p> Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p> FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p> FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p> FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p> Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p> FORBES:  Hello.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p> FORBES:  Come on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p> FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p> FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p> FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p> And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p> And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p> OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p> All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p> Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p> BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p> FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p> FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p> Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p> Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p> But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p> Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p> In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p> Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p> Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p> And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p> MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p> BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p> FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p> FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p> BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p> FORBES: Worries --</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p> MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p> BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p> FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p> ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p> ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p> So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p> BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p> MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p> ROLLINS: There's -</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p> ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p> FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p> ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p> ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p> ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p> FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p> ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BELL: How do you -</p><p> ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p> BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p> ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p> BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p> ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p> BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p> ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p> FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p> ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p> FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p> BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p> ROLLINS: Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p> ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p> MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p> ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p> BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p> ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p> ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p> BELL: It's not your money. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p> ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p> FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p> FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p> MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p> ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p> BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p> ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p> CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p> British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p> And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p> CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE: You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p> KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p> Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p> So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p> BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p> MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p> BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p> FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p> MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p> BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p> BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p> BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p> MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p> FORBES: They know.</p><p> BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p> The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p> Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p> Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p> New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p> Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p> FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p> In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p> BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p> YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p> And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p> Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p> BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p> So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p> YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p> But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p> FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p> BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p> FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p> YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p> FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p> YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p> YORK: Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p> MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p> YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p> FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p> YORK: Well --</p><p> FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p> BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p> FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p> FORBES: Exactly.</p><p> YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p> BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p> YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p> YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Her visit is expected to last four  days. Well, the Saudi Arabian stock market is joining FTSE Russell's  emerging market index. That's going to start March of next year. The move  is expected to draw billions of dollars of foreign portfolio investment  into the country. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister was on the show earlier  this week, talking about the country's reforms launched by the crown prince  Mohammed Bin Salman. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, FINANCE MINISTER, SAUDI ARABIA: We are at the stage  where we moved from planning over the past two years to execution. So there  is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of  June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.  Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi  Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the  movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo  Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef 'O'  Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that  also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p> Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for  the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb  recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super  fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to  find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they  did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel,  the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares  of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right,  I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it  for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise. </p><p> BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle. </p><p> FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p> CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p> FORBES: Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie  star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with  Mel Gibson. We've got the details right after this. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well move over Michael Jordan, here comes Lebron.  Jared has the story right now. Hey Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. More folks saying  \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has  played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p> Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his  point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p> Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning,  before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever,  March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this  week. Take a listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it gives us an opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP) </p><p> MAX: Yes, alll 30 MLB teams were scheduled to play today, but the Reds game  in Cincinnati against the Nationals postponed because of a rainy forecast.  They'll make it up tomorrow, first game 12:40 in Miami between the Cubs and  the Marlins. </p><p> History will be made in the NFL next season, the L.A. Rams are going to  have two male cheerleaders. While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore  Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton  Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of  the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p> Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves.  Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p> MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p> MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p> BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p> MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p> BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio. By the way, Gronk, I get to tell my one Gronk story. I saw him  wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once. </p><p> MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack. </p><p> BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big  screen. </p><p> MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts --  tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still  pretty good -</p><p> MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p> MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p> FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in  2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\"  everyone laughed. Now they're best buddies. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Wow interesting, Jared, thank you. Jared Max, catch the sports  sports reports and Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius XM115. Still ahead, we  head to outer space. That's next. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Forbes Media chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate, Steve  Forbes.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be here this morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, there is.</p><p> BELL:  A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge.  We're going  to talk about that, I know.  It will be interesting to see what the next  step has to say.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then of course, the final day of the -- of the  quarter.  We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the  first quarter, Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook,  let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm  going to teaser up.  Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal  has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as  care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to  borrow.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FORBES:  The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get  things back to reality.  Markets been worried about what might happen.   Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  We're going to get back to what's  happening in terms of the fundamentals.  We have this breaking news, the  President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning.  I have stated  my concerns with Amazon long before the election.  Unlike others they pay  little or no taxes to state and local governments.  Use our postal system  as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United  States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business.  The  President just tweeted that about Amazon.  Now, the President is taking his  pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as  a proposal stalls out in Congress.  Adam Shapiro covering the story from  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  And a good morning to you, Maria.  The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p> And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p> DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p> Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p> FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p> FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p> FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p> FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p> FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p> Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.  But yes,  this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of  user data, interacting abuser.  So we'll let you decide on this one.   Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year. </p><p> OK.  Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving  at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start  a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours.  They're going to install  new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for  you, Maria.  We're going to keep watching.  And then finally there is this.   Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC  in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSEANNE BARR:  And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great  again.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back  episodes.  That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of  the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us.  And also  President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on  the show's early success.  Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p> BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p> FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for  years.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.  He'll  weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well.   President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more.  Stay with us for  that.  Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show.  We're  taking you there.  Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official  opening tomorrow.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula,  North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have  decided to meet on April 27th.  This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p> If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p> NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p> Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p> NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p> Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p> We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p> RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p> RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p> RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p> RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p> RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p> RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p> RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p> RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p> RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p> RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p> RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p> RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p> RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p> RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p> RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p> Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p> And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p> VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p> GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p> You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p> GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p> BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p> FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p> FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stu, take it away.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p>White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p>Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p>But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p>Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p>Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p>MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p>FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p>FORBES: Worries --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p>MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p>FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p>ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p>So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p>ROLLINS: There's -</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p>ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p>FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p>ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p>ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p>FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p>ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: How do you -</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p>BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p>ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p>FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p>BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p>ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p>ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p>BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p>ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p>BELL: It's not your money. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p>ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p>FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p>FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p>CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p>British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p>And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p>CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p>KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p>Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p>So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p>FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p>FORBES: They know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p>The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p>Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p>Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p>New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p>Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p>FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p>In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p>YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p>And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p>Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p>BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p>So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p>YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p>But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p>FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p>FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p>YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p>FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p>YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p>MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p>YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p>FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p>YORK: Well --</p><p>FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p>FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p>FORBES: Exactly.</p><p>YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p>BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p>YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Her visit is expected to last four  days. Well, the Saudi Arabian stock market is joining FTSE Russell's  emerging market index. That's going to start March of next year.

More folks saying  \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has  played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p>Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his  point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p>Hey, happy Hope-ening Day.

Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for  the sport.

While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore  Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton  Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of  the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p>Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves.  Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p>MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p>MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio.

I saw him  wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once. </p><p>MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big  screen. </p><p>MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts --  tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still  pretty good -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p>MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p>FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in  2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\"  everyone laughed.

And  then protecting our borders as President Trump unveils new pictures of  construction of the wall, hundreds of law enforcement officials are  throwing their support behind that billed out.  Then hacks planes  ransomware reportedly strikes Boeing.  What you need to know as the company  becomes the latest to be hit by the WannaCry virus.  </p><p>Then this.

All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Forbes Media chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate, Steve  Forbes.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, there is.</p><p>BELL:  A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge.  We're going  to talk about that, I know.  It will be interesting to see what the next  step has to say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then of course, the final day of the -- of the  quarter.  We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the  first quarter, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook,  let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm  going to teaser up.  Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal  has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as  care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to  borrow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get  things back to reality.  Markets been worried about what might happen.   Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  We're going to get back to what's  happening in terms of the fundamentals.  We have this breaking news, the  President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning.  I have stated  my concerns with Amazon long before the election.  Unlike others they pay  little or no taxes to state and local governments.  Use our postal system  as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United  States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business.  The  President just tweeted that about Amazon.  Now, the President is taking his  pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as  a proposal stalls out in Congress.  Adam Shapiro covering the story from  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  And a good morning to you, Maria.  The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p>And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p>Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p>FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p>FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p>FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p>FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p>Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.

Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p>BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p>FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.

And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.

This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p>If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p>Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p>Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p>We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p>RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p>RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p>RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p>RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p>RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p>RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p>RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p>RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p>Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p>And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p>You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p>GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p>FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stu, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.

And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th.

Happy Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown. Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory. Take a look at those numbers, the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's personal data scandal. Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life. I think it's an invasion of privacy. Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years. We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business this week, today, actually. Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday. S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of trading. Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent. S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving. And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline of 55 points, right now. In Europe stocks are also higher. Take a look, the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up one percent. In Asia overnight, green across the board. Best performer there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China. Point of a quarter percent.</p><p>White House shake up once again now. Veterans Affairs, Secretary David Shulkin is out. President Trump has nominated White House position, Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position. The details on Shulkin's departure, coming up right here.</p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation. The shocking revelations coming up this morning.</p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left. The sitcom delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut. More as the show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.</p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green. The company's creator looks to brew up a new business with marijuana infused beer. We will tap in to that story, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell. Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning. Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us, Steve.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Steve has seen it all in terms of investing, in terms of politics. So, again, nobody better to have on the program this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. What's the most important to you this morning? What are you looking at? Markets, obviously under pressure.</p><p>FORBES: What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these tech companies to the assault. They did not see it coming, not more than Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them. Right now, Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor in his response. He should've laid out. They should've had better auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed. But you know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free, but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did they not see that coming, Dagen? I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for 2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\". Because we've been talking about this literally for years. I have said verbatim on this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management of it and it wasn't just the privacy data. It was like, rolling out, I've said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network. You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door. And it's not going to be (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FORBES: And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the algorithms on Facebook and other places. Conservative websites, dumb thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know that.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories. You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.</p><p>BELL: What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you know, just under one percentage point. So, maybe this means the bleeding could be done for the tech sector. We saw Facebook and Google who got had the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors react. Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning. Former Reagan Budget Director, David Stockman is here. Great America PAC Chairman and former Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us. And the CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as well. We got a big show this morning. So, do stay with us.</p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street. U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased regulatory oversight. They slammed chairs at big tech companies, yesterday. Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four percent. After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds. Facebook shares have fallen 14 percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting tool.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms over Facebook's data privacy practices. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOK: The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money. We've elected not to do that. We care about the user experience. And we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life. I think it's an invasion of privacy. I think it's -- privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.</p><p>BELL: It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last year plus. So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings. This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector. In the last six quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by almost eight percentage point. That's a huge beat. Usually S&amp;P 500 companies get four percent beat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But does this cut into that growth? I mean, does the reason to only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?</p><p>BELL: I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here. And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see how that comes out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent growth? In earnings for the first quarter?</p><p>BELL: 18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which actually exact the year for the quarter?</p><p>BELL: Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent. That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter. Steve, let me ask you about Amazon. Because once the President got in place. We were all speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency. So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon. And then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big. What are your thoughts on the White House? I mean, it's pushing back, by the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or antitrust ground. This is what we heard yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field for all businesses and this is no different. He's going to always look at different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES: Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial, denial. And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington Post,\" because he wanted to do it. But he thought there by political protection in Washington. He didn't realize it's going to make him a target. With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a different attitude. In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing that company down just as it does with any other company over time. I'm old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company. IBM when that was a big tech company. Microsoft's going to take over the world. Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling. So, let the free markets play out. Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been. Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company fresh and on the cutting edge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.</p><p>FORBES: Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon. If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people cut you slack. Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10 or 12 years to bring something to market. Amazon you know what they're doing, trying to build up volume successfully. But they make enough money to show they're not just losing money. They know how to make money if they want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a division in this companies that how people analyze them. Because I don't think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about Facebook's future. And I'm not talking about the regulators. I am talking about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy protections. And temple does have a line to stand on. Because these are the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple. So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the Facebook. Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the limiting the information they share with data broker. So, I think, when you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.</p><p>BELL: So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at this given time. And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to decline. And this (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FORBES: And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL: And in this country their biggest market. So, expect to see more of that in the first quarter, especially after this --</p><p>FORBES: Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his position because he sells product. Facebook is just selling the experience. Not a hard product. And Facebook's motto is now under threat. And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they don't want to pay up for content either. I'm sorry Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform. I want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually friends on Facebook. And what Mossberg former wall street columnist. He just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly personal ad free no data mining subscription service. Where people use that to share their most personal information. That data you pay to have it protected and they don't share any of that information. Essentially the same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and groups with their family members. He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES: And that had better be un-hackable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. I don't know if anybody wants to share anything at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on, you're sucked in to it. This is -- this is part of your life. They've conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in your relationship better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES: Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on her.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will take a break. When we come back, another cabinet shakeup. President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A. More on the Obama hold overs departure coming up.</p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot. Getting healthy viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning. We're expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up 75 points right now. The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police station in Venezuela. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: That's right Maria, at least 68 people died after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela. It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed. Angry families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.</p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the company's bonds touched a new low. Tesla close down more than seven percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of self-driving car technology. Of course, that does follow that fatal accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the technology sector a part of this as well. Tesla does depend on access to capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan. But Tesla shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two percent. So (INAUDIBLE) It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential legal battle. The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona. The terms of this had not been disclosed. Uber though did suspend itself driving testing program following that accident. The fall out is spreading, other companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the show wasted no time taking on politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE: Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should grow up and be president. Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on fire. Thank you for making America great again.</p><p>JACKIE RETORTS: Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?</p><p>ROSEANNE: Not on the real news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two back to back episodes. Making it the second most-watched entertainment program of the season. Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should add. President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on the shows early success. We should take a look at Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date. But if the show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria. Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she says.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday. We were talking during the break. It feels like this is the conversation happening across America right now. And to see family fighting over, it's real.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just were awful. Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much. It's not funny anymore. But this is true to Roseanne's character. And again, its finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in America. Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks. Which, those jokes have been told.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place. And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian and writer. She was a real important addition to the show. And these actors are phenomenal. John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You watch it? Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES: I'm going to have to watch on YouTube. But yes, I'm glad that it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your bubble. You'll find an audience out there. They make that mistake in movies and making on T.V. It's amazing. They're supposed to be in the business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of their audiences. Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Get out of your bubble. You're right.</p><p>BELL: I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as well. Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They also may bring people together. We'll keep watching that. Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this. Newly uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out. They're between the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the CIA early in the Russia investigation. The outrage coming up.</p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning. Beer company Blue Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Another White House shakeup. President Trump ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin. The President took the twitter last night to make the replacement. Here's what he writes. I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronnie L. Jackson, MD. As the new Secretary of the V.A. Jackson had been serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment. Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle. Lea, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration? We know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin. Your reaction to this decision.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to make it look like it was legitimate. Went to Europe then they accepted tickets to Wimbledon. And he said that these tickets were from a close personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government regulations.</p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first name when interviewed. So, I think what this really comes down to is sort of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job. And there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know, modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease wait times, increase access to mental health care. But when you are, you know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.</p><p>BELL: Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private care and they kind of sort of turned on him?</p><p>GABRIELLE: You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court would say. But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them. I think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything. People can say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things. But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the getting free tickets to Wimbledon. He did pay -- he did payback for the trip. He tried to --</p><p>FORBES: Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation. Is there any possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well. Huge deregulations still in place. You can just take your coupon or whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A. Of course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure out what the overall cost would be. I don't know how Admiral Jackson going to run the V.A. I think, one of the questions people are raising about him is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995. He's done a combat deployment where he did combat medicine. He's a very good reputation. And he started working, caring for the president health of the George W. Bush administration. But the question is his executive experience. You know, and I think that, that's really important in the V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer. The question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be able to bring to the table?</p><p>FORBES: And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's an important point. And he did a good job on that press conference about the president health about a month ago.</p><p>GABRIELLE: He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border wall. The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall construction to Twitter. He posted it yesterday. He showed a united front for the President. 380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for increased border security. They say this: Without border security and immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime. Now is the time to act. Lea, what's your take here?</p><p>GABRIELLE: You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they voted President Trump into office. I think that, illegal immigration was a huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall. They want to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the defense spending. Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this? Numerous reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military budget. We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place, that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the military. Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL: They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly needed to fight harder for the funding of border security. Wouldn't they get $1.6 billion in border security?</p><p>FORBES: Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Proper fencing. Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions or limits on how the cities use federal funding. I think that that -- I think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all comes together. He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before. I'm talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs. Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep rolling.</p><p>GABRIELLE: I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an issue if he tries to use military funding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE: We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence of appropriation made by law. And then there is of course U.S. code that says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law. He's going have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.</p><p>FORBES: Terms of illegal immigration and crime. Why do the Democrats think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to crackdown?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's pretty extraordinary.</p><p>GABRIELLE: I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to get in to, we don't have time. But I think, you know, for the Democrats is that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come from that population that are becoming Democrats now. So, I think that there's a political reason that Democrats do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll watch all that Lea. Thank you. Thank you very much. Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the date is set. Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set a date for their historic nuclear summit talks. Details on that, plus how this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market this morning. Tech stocks are higher across the board. Take a look, Facebook now up one and a quarter percent. We're back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter. It's been a wild quarter, that's for sure. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track for their first quarterly decline in more than two years. It's been a tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see. Stocks closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost one percent. In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next month, the implications from this meeting, coming up. Plus, North Korea eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds. And the CME group makes a major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than $5 billion. There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.</p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in its IPO last year. Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some eyebrows, this morning. And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you about it.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly uncovered text messages, which also these were coming. GOP Congressional investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia investigation. No shock here.</p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The more texts that come out really put the story together in terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe. What do you make of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN: Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen. Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan. And those documents supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something like this could actually take place. You know, you have the FBI that's supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe, about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES: Absolutely. That's the real collusion. And what's amazing is they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously. They'd never thought this guy was going to win. They were going to do everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and continued doing these illegal things. They should be in jail for abusing their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a massive abuse of power. That's why the story enrages me. I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES: And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES: What they don't want to say is, the President then President Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what these text messages are leading. Amy, what do you think about that? I mean, how far up the chain did this go? Did Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN: Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this, taking place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN: You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not just, you know, recently. So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee members. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser, Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.</p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: You can't have the most important law enforcement organization in the world, conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just extraordinary. And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures. He said he was going to subpoena for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents. So they start this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they sent 3,000, over six months. It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>FORBES: He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down. He cannot (INAUDIBLE) he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best. He's got to make a fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here? Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok and his girlfriend, Lisa Page. Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN: You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office, I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really tired of it. I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN: I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what else is incredible? When you look at the participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is this? They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES: Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>FORBES: Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of this went on, on your watch. And you're over this, selling your book, and again, attacking this president. I mean, it's a joke.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows. There, he is not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his leadership, they're not going to press him on it. They're going to ask him how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And what they tried to do is muddy the waters. They come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES: Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what he needs to do. Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES: That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES: Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA warrant, the last one, the last renewal. So he's got -- his hands aren't clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so that they can keep spying on him. Final word from you, Amy, we've got to jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN: Yes. Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions does stop up. I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly. So, let's hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we certainly will keep on it. Amy, good to see you, thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there. Coming up, singing the blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing their appetite for last year's hot IPO? The stock is down five and a half percent.</p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice, is tasked to get on the board of Netflix. This comes after her former boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The date is set for a historic meeting between North and South Korea. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th. A rare summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before. Japan, also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit. Discussions are reportedly underway there. All these developments follow Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week. It was his first trip outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.</p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist. The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.</p><p>OK. Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4 billion. NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S. treasuries. CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in Europe and Asia. CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.</p><p>All right. Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors. Rice saying, Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\" Rice's former boss, President Obama, may not be far behind her. Earlier this month, the New York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix subscribers. He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we should say. Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.</p><p>Finally, there is this. Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green. The brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers. They're alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana. They're going to be served chilled only available in Colorado. They're going to starts that this fall. Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer, and a stout beer just to start. Shares of Blue Moon's parent company, Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year. Pot-infused beer, Maria. Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado. Here's a good tweet on that Susan Rice story. Dagen, what do you think about Susan Rice joining the board of Netflix? Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\" Big mistake, I spy. I don't know, she unmasked. She did all that unmasking, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on national television and lied to the American people and lied to the families about why those individuals were killed. Oh, I remember it was a video.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was a video. And it happens to be September 11th, but it was a video.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not a terrorist attack. But, I don't know, but her experience to go on the board of Netflix.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a love fest, baby. Come on! A lot of documentaries that they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. OK.</p><p>BELL: This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment, I don't think. Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see.</p><p>FORBES: Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt. And what does he expect to get? He loves crony capitalism. He loves regulation and helps Netflix. It's so called net neutrality debate which is regulating the Internet to help the big guys. What's his game plan on this? What does think he's going to get out of it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES: It alienates half the country. You can have your opinions and voice them. But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward of, come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really important to put that out. We're going to take a break. When we come back, pulling on the apron strings. Blue Apron seems to be in trouble after its flashy IPO last year. We're taking a look at what the future holds for the meal kit company next. And then, of course, there's Tesla, stay with us on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again. Lauren Simonetti with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: It's an ugly tart, Maria. I mean, this is the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share. It's at a $1.88. We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to $360 million. So, it's certainly running on fumes. Mismanagement by the company, over spending. Competition not only with the -- look at the char -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue Apron. So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in to buy them and who should that person be? Rumors say Costco could be a potential buyer. But is this the state of the IPO market this year? Not necessarily the case. In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new numbers for the first quarter which ends today. We've seen 43 IPOs raising $15.6 billion. This is being led mostly by tech and by technology companies.</p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday. I remember Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon tumbled three percent each. And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on that day, shares popping 36 percent. And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21, not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a share. So, so far so good. Tuesday, we hear from Spotify. So, we'll see how IPO market holds up. Do you guys know Yeti, by the way? The Yeti Coolers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a cooler. They look cool. It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their plans; they withdrew their listing. And speculation is, it could have something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium product.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck. But he said, they're a bear to get into. And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough. That's how he --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the flaws in Yeti Coolers.</p><p>SIMONETTI: A premium product, not that many. They don't -- I guess they don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first quarter?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the first quarter ever while markets were volatile. Markets were actually down for the first quarter. But the IPOs did well. Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Could be the worst margin in 17 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it. Still ahead, as questions mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change ASAP to protect yourself. That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast: trouble for technology.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p> Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p> White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p> Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p> And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p> Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p> FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p> BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p> We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p> BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p> BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p> BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p> BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p> FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p> FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p> BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p> BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p> FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p> FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p> FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p> And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p> Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p> Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p> And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p> JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p> ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p> FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p> BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p> And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p> By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p> BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p> FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p> FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p> FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p> FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p> Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p> And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p> Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p> Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p> And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p> And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p> In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p> Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p> FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p> FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p> FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p> Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p> TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p> FORBES:  Hello.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p> FORBES:  Come on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p> FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p> FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p> FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p> TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p> And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p> And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p> OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p> All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p> Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p> BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p> FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p> FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p> Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast: trouble for  technology.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p>White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.

CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th.

Happy  Thursday to you, and good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th, your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast: Technology tumbling, shares of several big  tech names fell yet again yesterday amid fears of a regulatory crackdown.   Both Facebook and Twitter are now in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon all in correction territory.  Take a look at those numbers,  the slide coming amid fears of a regulatory crackdown following Facebook's  personal data scandal.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, slams Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  We're not going to traffic in your personal -- your  personal life.  I think it's an invasion of privacy.  Privacy to us is a  human right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decline weighed on the major averages once again yesterday.   The Dow, the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March in  nearly 20 years.  We are ending the month, ending the quarter for business  this week, today, actually.  Dow Industrials down nine points yesterday.   S&amp;P500 down seven, and the NASDAQ down almost 60, almost one percent lower  in yesterday's trade.</p><p>Let's check futures right now, we're looking at a balance at the start of  trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 90 points, that's one- third of one percent.  S&amp;P500 up half of percent with the 12-point moving.   And the NASDAQ is up almost one percent bouncing after yesterday's decline  of 55 points, right now.  In Europe stocks are also higher.  Take a look,  the major indices higher across the board with the DAX Index in Germany up  one percent.  In Asia overnight, green across the board.  Best performer  there as you see, up KOSPI Index and the Shanghai Composite in China.   Point of a quarter percent.  </p><p>White House shake up once again now.  Veterans Affairs, Secretary David  Shulkin is out.  President Trump has nominated White House position,  Admiral Ronny Jackson to take over the position.  The details on Shulkin's  departure, coming up right here.  </p><p>Collusion in the capital newly uncovered checks show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the Justice  Department along with democratic leadership over the Russia investigation.   The shocking revelations coming up this morning.  </p><p>And Roseanne storms back despite criticism from the left.  The sitcom  delivers a staggering 18 million viewers in its return debut.  More as the  show story gets a congratulatory call from the commander-in-chief.  </p><p>Plus, Blue Moon going green.  The company's creator looks to brew up a new  business with marijuana infused beer.  We will tap in to that story, coming  up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, FOX Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  Forbes Media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes is here and CFRA  Investment strategist, Lindsey Bell joining us this morning.  Good to see  you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Steve has seen it all in terms of investing,  in terms of politics.  So, again, nobody better to have on the program this  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  What's the most important to you this morning?   What are you looking at?  Markets, obviously under pressure.  </p><p>FORBES:  What you want to see is what's going to be the reaction to these  tech companies to the assault.  They did not see it coming, not more than  Microsoft 20 years ago so the intrusive coming after them.  Right now,  Facebook has got the biggest problem because Zuckerberg has been very poor  in his response.  He should've laid out.  They should've had better  auditing, better follow-up to make sure their rules were followed.  But you  know, we all knew, when we go on those things, we get those things free,  but They're going to use our data to sell us (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did they not see that coming, Dagen?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to start setting his alarm for  2:00 a.m. West Coast time and watching \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Because  we've been talking about this literally for years.  I have said verbatim on  this program, if you don't start typing up your business in the management  of it and it wasn't just the privacy data.  It was like, rolling out, I've  said the Facebook live video, policing terrorists on your social network.   You're asking for regulators to walk in the front door.  And it's not going  to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And you also alienated conservatives by discriminating with the  algorithms on Facebook and other places.  Conservative websites, dumb thing  to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- and that happened throughout the election, we know  that.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, googling Hillary Clinton to get one set of stories.   You Google Donald Trump, you get a whole different set of stories.  </p><p>BELL:  What I just noticed, was the Nasdaq was up to most this morning, you  know, just under one percentage point.  So, maybe this means the bleeding  could be done for the tech sector.  We saw Facebook and Google who got had  the most in this privacy concern and they were flat yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right yesterday -- this morning we'll see how investors  react.  Joining the conversation, White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro is with us this morning.  Former Reagan Budget  Director, David Stockman is here.  Great America PAC Chairman and former  Reagan Chief White House Political Adviser, Ed Rollins joins us.  And the  CIO of Blackrock Global CIO with fixed income Rick Rieder is with us as  well.  We got a big show this morning.  So, do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with technology stocks weighing on Wall Street.   U.S. markets closed lower yesterday after worries set in about increased  regulatory oversight.  They slammed chairs at big tech companies,  yesterday.  Amazon among the day's worst performers losing better than four  percent.  After Axios reported that President Trump wants to go after  Amazon on taxes or antitrust grounds.  Facebook shares have fallen 14  percent this month but rose slightly yesterday at the close after the  social network announced it would shut down a third-party ad targeting  tool.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook added his voice to the scores of criticisms  over Facebook's data privacy practices.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our  customer, if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money.   We've elected not to do that.  We care about the user experience.  And  we're not going to traffic in your personal -- your personal life.  I think  it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's --  privacy to us is a human  right.  It's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to hear Apple talk about Facebook that way, Lindsey  and it really did hit a whole slack of tech companies yesterday.  </p><p>BELL:  It really did, and you know what, it is concerning because the tech  sector really has been the bellwether for the stock market for the last  year plus.  So, we're going to be really watching first-quarter earnings.   This is a sector though that I have to remind people, you know, the  fundamentals really are intact for the tech sector.  In the last six  quarters you saw technology, sector companies beat earnings estimates by  almost eight percentage point.  That's a huge beat.  Usually S&amp;P 500  companies get four percent beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this cut into that growth?  I mean, does the reason to  only stops change with the bigger regulatory bite?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, yes, it's definitely going to be a concern, but I do think  that when you look at the market overall, you look at the 11 sectors and  the S&amp;P 500, it's going to be hard to find growth like you've seen here.   And sure, Amazon and Facebook are huge components of that, but we'll see  how that comes out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's quite a weigh, you're still looking at 16 percent  growth?  In earnings for the first quarter?  </p><p>BELL:  18.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which actually exact the year for the quarter? </p><p>BELL:  Sorry that's for the quarter, for the first -- for the year -- the  first-quarter we're looking at 16.5 percent.  That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, 16.5 percent for the first quarter.  Steve, let me ask  you about Amazon.  Because once the President got in place.  We were all  speculating what would happen with Amazon, I mean, we know how the  \"Washington Post\" has treated this president throughout his presidency.   So, they were speculation that maybe he would want to go after Amazon.  And  then you look at the size of the company and the number of businesses that  Amazon is in, and you do question whether or not it is getting too big.   What are your thoughts on the White House?  I mean, it's pushing back, by  the way, on the Axios report that the President may target Amazon on tax or  antitrust ground.  This is what we heard yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field  for all businesses and this is no different.  He's going to always look at  different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this  time. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, your thoughts.</p><p>FORBES:  Mark those words, at this time. That tells you, denial, denial,  denial.  And what you see here is that I think, basis book the \"Washington  Post,\" because he wanted to do it.  But he thought there by political  protection in Washington.  He didn't realize it's going to make him a  target.  With the Washington Post and said Donald Trump's the greatest  thing since George Washington, I think you'd see a little bit of a  different attitude.  In terms of Amazon, free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough remember G.M. when that was the big bad company.  IBM when that  was a big tech company.  Microsoft's going to take over the world.  Wal- Mart was going to take over the world, now struggling.  So, let the free  markets play out.  Well, it's amazing that Amazon has successful it's been.   Jeff Bezos, by the way uses teams internally to try to keep this company  fresh and on the cutting edge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's hard to compete with a company that doesn't mind  losing a lot of money quarter after quarter.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you see this is another lesson for Wall Street from Amazon.   If you step down the terms on what you're going do your business, people  cut you slack.  Just like drug companies, they're always going to take 10  or 12 years to bring something to market.  Amazon you know what they're  doing, trying to build up volume successfully.  But they make enough money  to show they're not just losing money.  They know how to make money if they  want to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook largely though, I think that maybe you start to get a  division in this companies that how people analyze them.  Because I don't  think you can value those earnings with so many question marks about  Facebook's future.  And I'm not talking about the regulators.  I am talking  about individuals who finally are waking up to abuse of their personal  information and how for more than a decade Facebook hasn't given a flying  flip about really protecting it and really lying to their users about what  they were doing with it or, and not being upfront about privacy  protections.  And temple does have a line to stand on.  Because these are  the principles that Steve Jobs put in place from very early on it Apple.   So, I think that you don't know how many users will leave, how much growth  will slow at Facebook, how the time spent on the platform might shrink and  how that will ultimately affect the advertising dollars that flow the  Facebook.  Because Facebook is raining in, (INAUDIBLE) one finger doing the  limiting the information they share with data broker.  So, I think, when  you try to come up with a valuation on Facebook at this point, that  (INAUDIBLE) is a very big question mark.  </p><p>BELL:  So, I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty around Facebook at  this given time.  And the fourth quarter we saw daily active users start to  decline.  And this (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FORBES:  And in this country, yes.</p><p>BELL:  And in this country their biggest market.  So, expect to see more of  that in the first quarter, especially after this --  </p><p>FORBES:  Although you have to say Tim Cook (INAUDIBLE) could be in his  position because he sells product.  Facebook is just selling the  experience.  Not a hard product.  And Facebook's motto is now under threat.   And their going to have be more of an information sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't want to pay up for content either.  I'm sorry  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say, Facebook's an advertising platform.  I  want to pass along, follow up Mossberg on Twitter, and where actually  friends on Facebook.  And what Mossberg former wall street columnist.  He  just throughout the idea yesterday of what if Facebook offered a highly  personal ad free no data mining subscription service.  Where people use  that to share their most personal information.  That data you pay to have  it protected and they don't share any of that information.  Essentially the  same way as a lot of people use iCloud that they share information and  groups with their family members.  He just threw the idea out there.</p><p>FORBES:  And that had better be un-hackable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  I don't know if anybody wants to share  anything at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once you're sucked into it, that's what Facebook is betting on,  you're sucked in to it.  This is -- this is part of your life.  They've  conned you into thinking they're doing this to make the communication in  your relationship better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you're not.</p><p>FORBES:  Resources say the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, instead of looking at you're -- the photos your  mothers posting on Facebook, how about picking up the phone and call on  her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break.  When we come back, another  cabinet shakeup.  President Trump fires V.A. secretary Davis Shulkin and  taps his White House position as the replacement at the V.A.  More on the  Obama hold overs departure coming up.  </p><p>And then ratings win for Roseanne the sitcom reboot.  Getting healthy  viewership in its return and the show start gets a boost from the  president.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, pretty good telling this morning.  We're  expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow is up  75 points right now.  The NASDAQ is up 45 and the S&amp;P up 10 points right  now.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, dozens of people killed after a fire at a police  station in Venezuela.  Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria, at least 68 people died  after a fire broke out during a riot in a police station jail in Venezuela.   It reportedly started after prisoners set fire to their mattresses and  authorities there say that 66 men and two women were killed.  Angry  families did clash with police afterwards demanding answers.  </p><p>Well, Tesla shares tumbling yesterday following a credit downgrade as the  company's bonds touched a new low.  Tesla close down more than seven  percent, that's after the stocks took a hit last week over scrutiny of  self-driving car technology.  Of course, that does follow that fatal  accident involving a Tesla in California and overall weakness in the  technology sector a part of this as well.  Tesla does depend on access to  capital market as it struggles to roll out its Model 3 sedan.  But Tesla  shares are trading higher in the free market right now, there up to two  percent.  So (INAUDIBLE)  It's been a tough few weeks for Uber, but they've avoided one potential  legal battle.  The company has settled with the family of a woman, run over  by one of their self-driving cars last week in Tempe, Arizona.  The terms  of this had not been disclosed.  Uber though did suspend itself driving  testing program following that accident.  The fall out is spreading, other  companies now are putting the brakes on their self-driving test as well in  several states.</p><p>And then finally, there's this, Roseanne's return to the small screen  brought in massive viewership for \"ABC\" in the breakout premiere and the  show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, ROSEANNE:  Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should  grow up and be president.  Even if they're a liar, liar, pants suit on  fire.  Thank you for making America great again.  </p><p>JACKIE RETORTS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse?  </p><p>ROSEANNE:  Not on the real news.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show wrapped up an astonishing 18.2 million viewers over two  back to back episodes.  Making it the second most-watched entertainment  program of the season.  Behind (INAUDIBLE) after the Super Bowl, we should  add.  President Trump even gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his  congratulations on the shows early success.  We should take a look at  Disney, ABC's parent company down nine percent year to date.  But if the  show keeps doing well, the stock may change course as well, Maria.   Roseanne Barr of course, has been very vocal about the fact she is a  supporter of President Trump and you're going to see that in the show she  says.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, look, it got a great reaction yesterday.  We were  talking during the break.  It feels like this is the conversation happening  across America right now.  And to see family fighting over, it's real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was saying that, the reason the ratings on the Oscars just  were awful.  Jimmy Kimmel again, the jokes about the President, the Vice  President about Trump, they -- mind that -- mind that so much.  It's not  funny anymore.  But this is true to Roseanne's character.  And again, its  finding the comedy in the division in families, and the division in  America.  Whether they're just making fun of say, the president's looks.   Which, those jokes have been told.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's not funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a lot of people didn't find it funny in the first place.   And another thing, they brought in Whitney Cummings who is a star comedian  and writer.  She was a real important addition to the show.  And these  actors are phenomenal.  John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, people were longing  for these characters to come back and see these actors at work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You watch it?  Did you watch it Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I'm going to have to watch on YouTube.  But yes, I'm glad that  it's happening, and I think it also shows Hollywood, get out of your  bubble.  You'll find an audience out there.  They make that mistake in  movies and making on T.V.  It's amazing.  They're supposed to be in the  business of free enterprise in terms of meeting the needs and wants of  their audiences.  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get out of your bubble.  You're right.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's a good way to bring the millennials back to T.V. as  well.  Nostalgic for those folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They also may bring people together.  We'll keep watching that.   Coming up, new Russia pro-bombshell, wait till you hear this.  Newly  uncovered text messages that I told you were coming out.  They're between  the FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggesting a  coordination between Obama's White House, former Senate Democrats and the  CIA early in the Russia investigation.  The outrage coming up.  </p><p>And then, this bugs for you, taking on a new meaning.  Beer company Blue  Moon launching a marijuana infused brew, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another White House shakeup.  President Trump  ousting Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin.  The President took the  twitter last night to make the replacement.  Here's what he writes.  I am  pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral  Ronnie L. Jackson, MD.  As the new Secretary of the V.A.  Jackson had been  serving as the White House physician remember prior to disappointment.   Joining us now to talk more about that, FOX News Correspondent, Lea  Gabrielle.  Lea, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) the holdover from the Obama administration?  We  know that, but initially the President was pretty high on Shulkin.  Your  reaction to this decision.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the fact that people  lost trust in him because of this I.G. report that came out basically  saying that he the fraud -- he used government money to take his wife on a  trip that his chief of staff doctored an e-mail to make it, you know, to  make it look like it was legitimate.  Went to Europe then they accepted  tickets to Wimbledon.  And he said that these tickets were from a close  personal friend because then that would be acceptable by government  regulations.  </p><p>By, he couldn't even remember this personal -- close personal friends first  name when interviewed.  So, I think what this really comes down to is sort  of the loss of trust and it's really unfortunate because there are a lot of  veteran organizations who felt like he was doing a really good job.  And  there's -- there've been a lot of improvements in the V.A. you know,  modernizing the appeals process, improves peace and satisfaction, decrease  wait times, increase access to mental health care.  But when you are, you  know, in this sort of position and you are prudently using government money  for personal trips, that sort of the end of it for you.  </p><p>BELL:  Does this have anything to do with the fact that, you know, the  administration wanted to move forward with government subsidizing private  care and they kind of sort of turned on him?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think that that's probably what people in his court  would say.  But I mean, look, when you're in this position and you're being  trusted by veterans who expect a certain level of integrity among  themselves and among the people who are supposed to be supporting them.  I  think, that's what it really comes down to more than anything.  People can  say that politics was involved, people can say a lot of different things.   But I think, bottom line is you can't be in this kind of position and  supposedly leaving the V.A. where integrity is paramount, and you know, the  getting free tickets to Wimbledon.  He did pay -- he did payback for the  trip.  He tried to --</p><p>FORBES:  Ronnie Jackson has a very good reputation.  Is there any  possibility of getting vouchers for veterans so, instead of trying to do  these internal reforms, some hospitals do it, some don't do it so well.   Huge deregulations still in place.  You can just take your coupon or  whatever, stamp with whatever and go to whatever hospital you want to go  whatever treatment you want and get that kind of competition and shake the  thing up instead of trying to do a top-down.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I mean, I think that is certainly one of the ideas that  people have thought of for correcting some of the issues on the V.A.  Of  course, there's you know, the cost benefit analysis and trying to figure  out what the overall cost would be.  I don't know how Admiral Jackson going  to run the V.A.  I think, one of the questions people are raising about him  is, you know, he's been serving the military since 1995.  He's done a  combat deployment where he did combat medicine.  He's a very good  reputation.  And he started working, caring for the president health of the  George W. Bush administration.  But the question is his executive  experience.  You know, and I think that, that's really important in the  V.A. because he is -- he is a career physician and military officer.  The  question is, you know, what kind of executive experience is he going to be  able to bring to the table?  </p><p>FORBES:  And will he get to appoint personnel who can round out his team?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an important point.  And he did a good job on that press  conference about the president health about a month ago.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  He did, he put him on a diet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the border -- I want to get to the border  wall.  The President is posting photos of the U.S.-Mexican border wall  construction to Twitter.  He posted it yesterday.  He showed a united front  for the President.  380 sheriffs from 40 states signed a letter calling for  increased border security.  They say this: Without border security and  immigration reform, more Americans will continue to be victims of crime.   Now is the time to act.  Lea, what's your take here? </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, I think this backs up what voters felt when they  voted President Trump into office.  I think that, illegal immigration was a  huge issue in this election and I think that not just law enforcement, but  the people of the united states want some sort of a border wall.  They want  to plug the jug on the illegal immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I was struck by the -- by the conversation around the  defense spending.  Dagen, I wonder, what do you think about this?  Numerous  reports now say that the President has suggested funding the construction  of the newly 2000-mile long Mexican border wall through the U.S. military  budget.  We know, well, what went on to get that military money in place,  that's spending disaster $1.3 trillion, but they needed to fund the  military.  Will some of that money go to the border wall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They should fight the Republicans and President Trump frankly  needed to fight harder for the funding of border security.  Wouldn't they  get $1.6 billion in border security?  </p><p>FORBES:  Just maintenance.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Proper fencing.  Again, not cracking down on sanctuary cities  where the Congress has the power to purse, they didn't put any restrictions  or limits on how the cities use federal funding.  I think that that -- I  think, to now try to take the money from the military is questionable and  another thing, you know what, President Trump where in this all -- this all  comes together.  He ran on draining the swamp and instead he has his  cabinet secretary spending taxpayer money essentially to buy fan boats, so  they can navigate the swamp that's even murkier than it was before.  I'm  talking about like even Ben Carson and the $31,000 dining table and chairs.   Again, they need to start answering for this and heads are going to keep  rolling.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to agree with this, President Trump is going to have an  issue if he tries to use military funding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I figure.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We go back to the constitution Article one section nine clause  seven says, No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in consequence  of appropriation made by law.  And then there is of course U.S. code that  says that appropriation shall be applied only to the objects for which  appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  He's going  have to go back to Congress in order to -- in order to get money from the  military that was appropriate specifically when it comes down to balance  the power the way our government --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Democrats he's fighting back about this wall.  </p><p>FORBES:  Terms of illegal immigration and crime.  Why do the Democrats  think that's a winning issue being on the other side of trying to  crackdown?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, I think, this is a whole bigger issue we're about to  get in to, we don't have time.  But I think, you know, for the Democrats is  that our population of our has changed and they have more voters that come  from that population that are becoming Democrats now.  So, I think that  there's a political reason that Democrats do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch all that Lea.  Thank you.  Thank you  very much.  Lea Gabrielle, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, the date is set.  Kim Jong-un and South Korea's leader have set  a date for their historic nuclear summit talks.  Details on that, plus how  this affects trade, coming up next.</p><p>And then we continue to watch the volatility in markets, particularly  technology after the Facebook fallout and the impact on the broader market  this morning.  Tech stocks are higher across the board.  Take a look,  Facebook now up one and a quarter percent.  We're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March  29th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  higher this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the  start of trading by about 75 points on the Dow, 10 points higher on the S&amp;P  and 41 points higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today marks the final trading day of the month and the first quarter.  It's  been a wild quarter, that's for sure.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are on track  for their first quarterly decline in more than two years.  It's been a  tough quarter on stocks, down about four percent, as you can see.  Stocks  closing the day, yesterday for the downside, the NASDAQ was the worst  performer, down almost one percent, as technology traded lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check European indices right now, they are  higher across the board, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up almost  one percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks ended higher, and it was just  edging higher, really, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite, up  one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>And historic summit on the Korean peninsula, North Korea's dictator Kim  Jong-un, excited to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, next  month, the implications from this meeting, coming up.  Plus, North Korea  eyed in a Bitcoin heists, Pyongyang's hackers reportedly stealing from an  exchange as the Kim regime hunts for funds.  And the CME group makes a  major acquisition, the exchange giant acquiring any NEX group for more than  $5 billion.  There's a chart of the CME group, this morning.  </p><p>And a fall from grace for Blue Apron, the company now has a market  evaluation of roughly $350 million, that's down from nearly $2 billion in  its IPO last year.  Plus, Netflix, making a change to its board of  directors, the streaming giant says it will add President Obama's National  Security Adviser, Susan Rice, to the board, the choices raising some  eyebrows, this morning.  And a rocking mountain high for Blue Moon, for the  beer giant, adding a new ingredient to its beer, marijuana, we'll tell you  about it.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, FBI theory over nearly  uncovered text messages, which also these were coming.  GOP Congressional  investigators tell Fox News the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  administration, Former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI and  the Justice Department, during the early stages of the Russia  investigation.  No shock here.  </p><p>In one of the text messages, Strzok texts Page this, internal joint cyber  cd intel piece for D, which refers to former FBI Director James Comey, is a  scene setter for Former Chief of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  brief, Trainor, the head of the FBI cyber division, directed all cyber info  be pulled.  I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be  best for D, the director, to have it before the Wednesday White House  session.</p><p>Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who's been  leading the charge on this, reacted to the new developments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  The  Democrats appear like they weaponize to some degree, the intelligence  services, you know, by using the foreign intelligence surveillance  apparatus in this country, to go and target the opposition campaign, is  totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Republican Strategist and Former Nevada  State GOP Chairman, Amy Tarkanian, Amy, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>AMY TARKANIAN,FORMER CHAIRWOMAN, NEVADA STATE GOP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The more texts that come out really put the story together in  terms of how they came up with this whole Russia probe.  What do you make  of all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, it's really -- it's frightening, you have Sen.  Reid who was briefed by then CIA Director Brennan.  And those documents  supposedly being leaked and used for a Yahoo news story to actually  catapult this into these allegations, it is mind blowing that something  like this could actually take place.  You know, you have the FBI that's  supposed to be, you know, basically, and an independent agency and what we  find in this, they are abusing their power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it certainly appears, Steve, that they were all  in this, in terms of a fix, coming together with a story about a probe,  about a story about Russia collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,  which never existed, and they seemed to be all in on it.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  That's the real collusion.  And what's amazing is  they tried to redact some of this stuff, tried to hide it, obviously.   They'd never thought this guy was going to win.  They were going to do  everything they could to keep him from winning, and then when he won, you  know what they said, oh, you know what, and they continue to cover up and  continued doing these illegal things.  They should be in jail for abusing  their authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a massive abuse of power.  That's why the story enrages  me.  I just -- they have these powerful seats and they used that power to  actually take down a political enemy, Donald Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  And what they don't want to say is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Based on nothing.</p><p>FORBES:  What they don't want to say is, the President then President  Obama, probably knew all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what these text messages are leading.  Amy, what  do you think about that?  I mean, how far up the chain did this go?  Did  Obama direct all of this?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and I would  actually find it very hard to believe that he didn't know about this,  taking place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  of course.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, we are finding out more and more about the abuse that  the FBI and CIA have been doing over -- actually, for quite some time, not  just, you know, recently.  So, you know, it stinks to high heaven and I  think it does start at the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we know that the FBI and the Department of Justice  are now officially under investigation for the alleged FISA abuses in the  Russia probe, following allegations last month by GOP House Intel Committee  members.  DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday, he's  reviewing what FBI officials and the Department of Justice knew, when they  asked a Federal Court to let them spy on Former Trump Campaign Adviser,  Carter Page, during the presidential campaign.  </p><p>Here's what House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has to say about the investigation, last  night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  This is not a simple move for the Inspector General to make, to go  after the top people in the FBI.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  You can't  have the most important law enforcement organization in the world,  conducting itself in the manner it did in 2016 and on into 2017.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just extraordinary.  And you know, Bob Goodlatte joined me last  two weeks ago on Sunday Morning Futures.  He said he was going to subpoena  for the documents, then they slow walked all the documents.  So they start  this investigation and they say, look, we want 1.2 million documents, they  sent 3,000, over six months.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, but now, Christopher Ray, he's adding more men.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doubling it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He's adding more manpower and womanpower to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>FORBES:  He has got to make a decision, whether he's going to be the guy  who cleans up the FBI and saves the FBI or go down.  He cannot (INAUDIBLE)  he's due announcing, oh, we're trying our best.  He's got to make a  fundamental decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amy, what I want to know is, will there be any justice here?   Look, we know that the people who had these powerful seats have abused  their power, I'm talking about Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce or, the  Department of Justice and a couple of others, not to mention Peter Strzok  and his girlfriend, Lisa Page.  Are we going to see justice here?</p><p>TARKANIAN:  You know, with somebody like President Trump, being in office,  I sure would hope there is going to be, but it seems to be a pattern that's  happened over and over where these individuals are actually just released  and let free, and it's very disappointing, and I think the public is really  tired of it.  I would hope so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  I would like to see that take place, finally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what else is incredible?  When you look at the  participation of the CIA and John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, who have been  all over CNN, all year, so critical of this president, how arrogant is  this?  They were also in on it, it appears.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and even more arrogant, Comey, coming out with a book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this went on, on your watch.  And you're over this,  selling your book, and again, attacking this president.  I mean, it's a  joke.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they should throw the book at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey is going to go on all these talk shows.  There, he is  not going to get pressed, people are not familiar, they choose not to  familiarize themselves with what was going on at the FBI under his  leadership, they're not going to press him on it.  They're going to ask him  how much he hates Trump on a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what they tried to do is muddy the waters.  They  come up with lots of different information to just confuse everything, when  we actually know, very clearly, what went on here.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, can the Attorney General Sessions step up to the plate and  make sure that this is going to be done with the department he has today?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he needs to do.  Will he do it?</p><p>FORBES:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  Especially with that number 2 he has as part of that collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rod Rosenstein, yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And while Rosenstein signed off on the renewal of the FISA  warrant, the last one, the last renewal.  So he's got -- his hands aren't  clean on that either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Well, they did renew that FISA warrant, four  times, right, once, and an additional three times, Amy Tarkanian, with the  same information, the same dossier they used to just keep renewing it so  that they can keep spying on him.  Final word from you, Amy, we've got to  jump.</p><p>TARKANIAN:  Yes.  Well, I actually -- I hope that Attorney General Sessions  does stop up.  I know that there have been a number of Republicans in the  base that have been disappointed with him, moving so slowly.  So, let's  hope that he goes in the right direction with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we certainly will keep on it.  Amy, good to see you,  thanks so much, Amy Tarkanian joining us there.  Coming up, singing the  blues, meal kit company, Blue Apron, shares plummet, are investors losing  their appetite for last year's hot IPO?  The stock is down five and a half  percent.  </p><p>And then this, Former National Security Adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice,  is tasked to get on the board of Netflix.  This comes after her former  boss, Barack Obama, is reportedly working with the media company as well,  back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The date is set for a historic meeting between  North and South Korea.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, South Korea announcing today that President Moon Jae- in will meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27th.  A rare  summit between the two countries, which have only met twice before.  Japan,  also, is putting out fillers to North Korea about a bilateral summit.   Discussions are reportedly underway there.  All these developments follow  Kim's surprise visit to China earlier this week.  It was his first trip  outside of his country since he assumed power back in 2011.  </p><p>And separately, investigators in South Korea are looking into North Korea's  possible involvement in a Bitcoin heist.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting this morning that investigators are looking to see if North Korea  was behind the hacking of Youbit, it's a South Korean cryptocurrency  exchange.  Officials believe that North Korea is so desperate for currency  because of the crushing sanctions that they've turn to Bitcoin for relief.  </p><p>OK.  Breaking overnight, CME Group buying Britain's NEX Group for $5.4  billion.  NEX owns the biggest electronic platform for trading U.S.  treasuries.  CME says the deal is also going to expand its presence in  Europe and Asia.  CME Group owns the Chicago Border Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  CME shares up merely nine percent so far this year.  </p><p>All right.  Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador, Susan  Rice, now has a new role on Netflix's board of directors.  Rice saying,  Netflix is \"a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality  productions, and unique culture I deeply admire.\"  Rice's former boss,  President Obama, may not be far behind her.  Earlier this month, the New  York Times reports that the former president and first lady were in talks  with Netflix for a deal, possibly involving exclusive content for Netflix  subscribers.  He's already appeared with David Letterman on Netflix, we  should say.  Shares of Netflix up 95 percent, 95, over the last year.  </p><p>Finally, there is this.  Blue Moon Beer is adding a little green.  The  brewery company is launching three marijuana infused beers.  They're  alcohol free, but again, they're filled marijuana.  They're going to be  served chilled only available in Colorado.  They're going to starts that  this fall.  Company says, they will begin with light beer, a wheat beer,  and a stout beer just to start.  Shares of Blue Moon's parent company,  Molson Coors, down about eight percent so far, this year.  Pot-infused  beer, Maria.  Those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and, you know, marijuana is legal in Colorado.  Here's a  good tweet on that Susan Rice story.  Dagen, what do you think about Susan  Rice joining the board of Netflix?  Here's a tweet from Karen Nelson, she  says: \"Big mistake, Netflix,\" and then a picture of Susan Rice, \"I spy.\"   Big mistake, I spy.  I don't know, she unmasked.  She did all that  unmasking, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then, she lied about the Benghazi attacks that she went on  national television and lied to the American people and lied to the  families about why those individuals were killed.  Oh, I remember it was a  video. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a video.  And it happens to be September 11th, but it  was a video.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a terrorist attack.  But, I don't know, but her experience  to go on the board of Netflix.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a love fest, baby.  Come on!  A lot of documentaries that  they have on there and I watch a lot of them, they're very, very left- leaning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p>BELL:  This isn't going to help them in the current regulatory environment,  I don't think.  Regulatory is currently in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While this focuses on a bigger bite from Washington, you see. </p><p>FORBES:  Consider the reception of Roseanne and what the hasting is doing  with Netflix bringing on these far left-wing people is going to hurt.  And  what does he expect to get?  He loves crony capitalism.  He loves  regulation and helps Netflix.  It's so called net neutrality debate which  is regulating the Internet to help the big guys.  What's his game plan on  this?  What does think he's going to get out of it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a very good point.</p><p>FORBES:  It alienates half the country.  You can have your opinions and  voice them.  But, you've got a company that you're supposed to be steward  of, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we just saw the success of Roseann, really  important to put that out.  We're going to take a break.  When we come  back, pulling on the apron strings.  Blue Apron seems to be in trouble  after its flashy IPO last year.  We're taking a look at what the future  holds for the meal kit company next.  And then, of course, there's Tesla,  stay with us on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investors are hoping meal kit company, Blue  Apron, can cook something up as the stocks lived again.  Lauren Simonetti  with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  It's an ugly tart, Maria.  I mean, this is  the stock that in June of last year, IPO-ed a $10.00 a share.  It's at a  $1.88.  We were talking at one point of like $2 billion value slashed to  $360 million.  So, it's certainly running on fumes.  Mismanagement by the  company, over spending.  Competition not only with the -- look at the char  -- not only the likes of Amazon but also with other meal preparation kit  companies like Hello Fresh, which is bigger, believe it or not, than Blue  Apron.  So, you know, if they're running on fumes, and someone to come in  to buy them and who should that person be?  Rumors say Costco could be a  potential buyer.  But is this the state of the IPO market this year?  Not  necessarily the case.  In fact, Renaissance IPO is out with some new  numbers for the first quarter which ends today.  We've seen 43 IPOs raising  $15.6 billion.  This is being led mostly by tech and by technology  companies.  </p><p>Speaking of tech, Dropbox, Unicorn, they IPO-ed on Friday.  I remember  Friday because that was the day when the big tech companies like Facebook  and Amazon tumbled three percent each.  And you have Dropbox IPO-ing on  that day, shares popping 36 percent.  And look at this, they IPO-ed at 21,  not even a week ago, and they're trading in the premarket at $31.00 a  share.  So, so far so good.  Tuesday, we hear from Spotify.  So, we'll see  how IPO market holds up.  Do you guys know Yeti, by the way?  The Yeti  Coolers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a cooler.  They look cool.  It's a cooler.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, I'm glad you say it like that because they dropped their  plans; they withdrew their listing.  And speculation is, it could have  something to do with the steel and aluminum tariffs, because obviously  that's what's in their tumblers, and their thermoses, and coolers or they  don't want to go the way of, you know, GoPro -- you have a great premium  product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As my father told me, I know those Yeti Coolers look real cool  hanging off the back of somebody's pickup truck.  But he said, they're a  bear to get into.  And he said, I can't get my bud quick enough.  That's  how he -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We had long family discussions at the dinner table about the  flaws in Yeti Coolers.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A premium product, not that many.  They don't -- I guess they  don't want to go the way of GoPro, for instance, but nonetheless, is bags  questions: what is the state on IPO market right after a good first  quarter?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting to see such a strong quarter in the  first quarter ever while markets were volatile.  Markets were actually down  for the first quarter.  But the IPOs did well.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Could be the worst margin in 17 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren Simonetti, we'll follow it.  Still ahead, as questions  mount about your privacy on Facebook, we've got the sever Genie to change  ASAP to protect yourself.  That's next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 29th.

Zuckerberg has no intention of providing money that somehow enhances our liberty. Like Trump[11], Zuckerberg is working for his own interest[12], not the general welfare.

France, Italy, and Germany recognize the threat Libra poses to liberty and sovereignty. French Minister of the Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire explained why he and allies Germany and Italy oppose Facebook money: He noted that Libra was due to be backed by a basket of currencies and assets, a principal sticking point. 'All Facebook [16]would have to do would be to decide to use more or fewer dollars or euros to affect the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar, and thus have a direct impact on trade, industry and nations which use the dollar or euro as their base currency,' he said. This could harm monetary policy and affect governments' efficiency, he added. 'Do we want to put monetary policy in the hands of a private company like Facebook? My answer is clearly no,' he said. Still, Le Maire said he was not opposed to the creation of a digital currency, which France could develop 'in a European framework.' 'The right answer is not a private digital currency under the control of one of the largest multinationals on the planet,' he said, referring to Facebook's more than two billion users ['European Countries move to Block Facebook's Libra Digital Currency[17],' France 24, 2019.10.18].

The campus has 70 people recruited from industry, academia and across government, and its role is \"across the government's statistical service as an analysis function.\" </p><p>Smith commented that the \"government and the civil service has a huge skill set.\" The question is how those are shared and \"how do we build up cross-government capability for data sharing and also for sharing the tools and techniques that we are developing?\" </p><p>However, the government is not necessarily the best placed to exploit its own data, according to Cathrine Armour, director of the customer division at the UK Hydrographic Office. </p><p>\"How can government use its own data more effectively? Perhaps we shouldn't be using it, perhaps, particularly where it's not GDPR collected, we need to provide it to others who have better domain expertise and understand our customers and their journeys more than we do,\" she said. </p><p>\"Not all data is created equal, we need to be really conscious of the fact that we want integrity of the decisions that we are making, we need integrity of the data we are proving to make those decisions,\" Armour added. </p><p>On the issue of building up skills within government, Steven Steer, head of data, Ofgem commented: \"We need to have expertise ourselves to be able to have good approaches to policies on the market. He cited the rise of online consultations in recent years as an example of how digital technology can increase participation in government. In Ofgem's case, the organisation is moving towards \"self service of regulation\" and \"crowd sourcing of regulatory rules,\" he said. </p><p>\"We need data and digital capabilities to enable the right decision to be made, not necessarily to be the ones directly doing it,\" Steer commented. </p><p>The issue of greater standardisation over the collection, sharing and usage of data dominated the discussion. Marcus Bell, director at the Cabinet Office's race disparity unit, expressed concern over a lack of standardisation in data. </p><p>He outlined how different departments use different words and terms to define ethnicity, something which is part of a wider issue. \"Big tech is based on linking together different data sets. If the currency is all different it's almost impossible to do that, so I'm wondering if there's a case for a bit more top down prescription about data standards,\" he said. </p><p>'We now have a whole wealth of data, all collected in lots of different ways, the question then is can we share it?' </p><p>The case for common standards was reiterated byErika Lewis, deputy director, national data strategy at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport. \"We are pulling together, with ONS and GDS, some work for a spending review package but the focus will be on some cross governmental work but also a big push on standards because that's exactly what I've been hearing since I arrived in DCMS, that's the big thing, we've got to grab it by the horns,\" she said. </p><p>Using master data management, where there is a central source of data that everything else spins off from, \"is a very standard way of doing things in the private sector\" and could be useful for government too, according to Matthew O'Kane, VP EMEA head of AI and analytics, Cognizant. </p><p>In terms of the wealth of data available, not just within government, Julie Pierce, director of openness, data and digital, Food Standards Agency, commented: \"There's a huge amount of global data out there that's open and published and that's a huge asset to us all.\" </p><p>Potential legal issues around the use of data were raised by Wendy Hardaker, commercial law director at the Government Legal Department. She warned: \"It's about the way in which you've collected the data, often, as to what you can then do with it, and you can fall into all sorts of elephant traps if you've not thought about that at the start of the process. We now have a whole wealth of data, all collected in lots of different ways, the question then is can we share it?\" </p><p>Some of the difficulties around the use of data revolve around trust, according to Yatin Mahandru, head of public sector, Cognizant. \"The citizen's trust in the data and what government are going to do with it and the service the government is going to provide, and then also the trust between departments when you are exchanging that data as to what it's going to be used for, whether it's enforcement or something else.\" </p><p>Manzoni brought the discussion to a close by outlining what he called \"three big dilemmas as we nudge forward.\" The first is the \"top down bottom up one, do we let a thousand flowers bloom, do we put in the standards, at what point do we do this?\" </p><p>The second surrounds open data. \"Is it a total muddle or does it have value for somebody else and if it has value for somebody else why would I give my data away when I could sell it?\" he asked. </p><p>Third is the skills issue. \"How do we actually teach people to frame the question right, so have we got that right or are we focussing on the high-end data scientists or actually, should we do something completely different?\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVSCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVSCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-N4F1-JD3S-J38W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><timeReceived>9:14 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Civil Service World (online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WWI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

And hopefully, you get a chance, if you haven't been in here before, to enjoy one of our new facilities. So welcome to the new center of our business here in London, 250 Bishopsgate.</p><p>We're going to spend the next wee while talking to, I think, the progress we've made but, importantly, the platform we've laid for our technology for this organization. And obviously, we'll leave some time for questions at the end, but I'm going to be accompanied by 2 of my colleagues. We're 3 very small representation, actually, at the end of the day, a very large part of the bank's organization, but Kevin Hanley, our Director of Innovation; and Christine, who's our CFO for this part of the organization. So all 3 of us are going to present over the next, let's see how long this takes, let's say an hour. Famous last words, right? Might take a little less.</p><p>So I'm going to open up. Christine is then going to talk to the financial highlights, which means actually getting into the finance in a little bit more detail than I'm going to go. And then Kevin is going to talk to our innovation agenda. And then I'll do a wrap-up on that, and then we'll come to some questions if that's okay.</p><p>So it's a very grand slide. We all know that the business of banking is changing. In fact, it's been in a constant state of change through certainly my experience and time in this industry. I joined as a technology graduate with an interest in economics and statistics as your first degree in that many years ago. And what we're seeing is actually the delivery of new and disruptive capabilities and new emergence at a rate that we've not seen before in the industry. So what I want to do today was to really reflect on our response to that.</p><p>Now I stood on a stage not far from here, actually, 280 Bishopsgate 5 years ago. Ross had just gone into the job as Chief Executive, and I had just joined the organization to be the Chief Administrative Officer. And we were presenting in the first results session and laying out the plan for the next 5 years. I got a chance at the time to say we were going to do 4 things with the platforms of the bank. The first thing I said we'd address were their resilience. Now coming on the back of some of the challenges we'd had, think in 2012, that was an obvious focus for us.</p><p>Second thing I said we'd do is simplify things. The third thing I said we would do was to deliver more efficient outcomes for our customers and for ourselves. And the last thing I said, and I whispered, was the word innovation. And at the time, actually, a number of people said to me, \"You're not here to do that. Get back in your box.\" And you'll see some of what we've done by ignoring that feedback and that advice. There's a theme there. These have evolved to the 4 threads really of our strategy here, and it's not one at the expense of the other. These are the 4 dimensions of how we have nurtured, enhanced the platform for this bank over the last 5 years.</p><p>As you'll have seen, the cost base of this organization has reduced quite substantially over the time in which Ross has been in the seat and I've been in the organization. But some things you might not have seen is actually the quantum of investment through that time, which has been quite substantial. It's about GBP 7 billion, which is what we said we would spend. And that really has gone into transforming this bank and giving us a platform now that we think is a strong platform and a strong foundation. You'll see a couple of the metrics here just in terms of how the dynamics of that spend has changed over time as well. And we've gone from, I guess, more of a focus in the mandatory and regulatory investments into a greater focus in what I consider to be discretionary over time.</p><p>That's yielded some real outcomes, and I quite like this slide because it captures on one slide -- you ever heard the term walk and chew gum? This is the virtuous outcome of the investment that we've made over the last few years to those 4 dimensions of investment. Firstly, back in 2014, we saw over 300 outages to our core infrastructure that impacted our customers during that year. In the last 12 months, we saw 13. This year-to-date, there have been 3. By the way, you haven't seen any of those, I think, this year, yes? That's a dramatic improvement in terms of the availability of the service. Now we've done that through investment. We've done that through the simplification of the estate here.</p><p>So another metric I put up on this chart is, actually, we have less systems now than we had back in 2014. We've gone from around about 5,000 to, I think, the slide here says, what, 2,300. It's closer to 2,100 now, and we're on a path ultimately to closer to 1,500. So you'd like to think we're probably doing less than we were doing before, but actually, we're doing considerably more than we were doing before. There are applications in the estate now that didn't exist at all. So this is the net outcome from a significant investment that has created new capability at the same time as we've actually rationalized the estate. We've gone from multiple solutions to some problems to single solutions.</p><p>We've also enhanced what we term here the control environment through that period. So not only have we stabilized the platform and simplified it, it now merits a rating, which is shared externally from a control perspective, which is markedly better than it was. And we said it was a 3 at the outset. We have a grading scale here of 1 to 5. 1 is [an attainment] of perfection, not really where you want to be as a price point. That doesn't make any sense. But we've now got a satisfactory with the exceptions control environment for this platform that we didn't have back in 2014.</p><p>Interestingly as well, and I say this is a virtuous cycle or outcome, the volume of change going through this estate has increased as well. So it's up about, what is it, 20%? So more change going through the environment. Change typically and historically has created issues, but we've seen a dramatic reduction in the lack of availability of the service or an improvement in the availability of the service. Not only that, the cost of this platform has gone down. So to run this platform back in 2014, as it says, cost more than GBP 1.1 billion, close to GBP 1.2 billion a year. It's now around GBP 900 million. So volume of change up, cost down, control environment improved and the performance and the availability of service markedly improved.</p><p>Now we could have spent less and yielded a different set of dynamics, we could have actually introduced less change that would have definitely reduced the volume of issues I had, but we didn't, okay? So it's a virtuous outcome across those dimensions. And why is that? Because, actually, what we have now is a managed service and a managed estate. And there's just one other stat I'll put out there. Back in 2014, we had 550 projects running in the bank at that time each of which had met, and you guys will be familiar with this, some financial hurdle. We said there was going to be return on them and so on. The problem was that they had nothing to do with the other 549, okay? We now run a single portfolio and have done over 5 years and as a benefit to that, continuity. So we've steered this through time. And the emphasis over time has gone away from the mandatory, it's gone away from the refresh and has gone into the new.</p><p>One aspect of security -- sorry, one aspect of the resilience of our platforms is the overall security and the availability of those services. I tell this story because it was a very stressful point in our time together, Ross, wasn't it? There was a Friday night and it had been a pretty full-on week here, and we were seeing, as you saw, and exhibiting more than one significant outage on a daily basis. It was a Friday night, and I was -- at the end of the week going with my wife out for the evening in Edinburgh, which is where I live. And Ross was in London going out with his wife, Steph, for the evening. And I got a call to say, actually, our mobile platform is not available, and there's been a DDoS attack and it is not available again. By the way, 34 times in that first year, our mobile platform wasn't available, not all for DDoS attacks, but in that particular case, it was.</p><p>And Ross said to me, \"What's it like talking to the shortest tenured CEO of all time?\" And I remember saying to him, \"Actually, what's it like talking to the shortest tenured CAO of all time?\" That was pretty stressful that once a day, I was having to call Ross to say, \"Actually, the service is not available.\" And not in all circumstance, but in many circumstance, it was due -- not -- in some circumstance, it was due to external attack.</p><p>We went through the whole of last year without a minute lost despite the volume of external attacks on this platform, so DDoS attacks, up by, well, significant volume last year. The quantum of the scale of those attacks is like a hundredfold of the scale of those attacks back in 2014. So not a minute lost through the whole year. And why is that? Because, actually, we decided to invest in the capability. By the way, ahead of the competition. So we were the first here. We've seen others follow our lead subsequently, but we chose to take the proactive step to secure this environment to protect us from those DDoS attacks.</p><p>We've also and have decided that we were going to invest in our fraud capabilities. Now there are 2 ways of funding fraud. One is to give it to the fraudsters by actually replenishing every day everything that our customers lose through fraud, whether they're at fault or not. The other complementary way is to actually reduce the volume of fraud in the first place. So we've been very focused on investments that we could make that reduce the fraud that we've seen for the bank here. Now this is an ongoing arms race in many respects. So the more we do, the more that's thrown at us. But we've seen a marked improvement in terms of our fraud performance through that time, and some of the stats are here despite the volume of fraud within the industry increasing.</p><p>And the last thing I just wanted to call out here is in the last 12 months, and I sort of made this case, I've had to talk to an airline, to a hotel chain, to a telco, all of whom are part of the system that ultimately make up the financial system of the U.K., because they take data from our customers and they take payments, and a number of them have been compromised. There is a certain amount I can do to secure our perimeter, but we have to work with the broader community. And so Alison and I back in February hosted an event for our customers to come in, where they thought they were going to have a bit of a lecture. And what we did was actually run a scenario where they'd been compromised, and we ran them through the next 2 hours what they would do in that circumstance.</p><p>They were, to a person, resounding in their appreciation for what had been run for them and their sense to -- because it's not until it's happened to you that you really feel the pain of the compromise of that data, and this happened, you say, with increasing -- so there's a certain amount we can do for ourselves. There's a certain amount we're doing for the industry. We're also working with some of our peers in the other banks to build a community to further protect our customers.</p><p>Moving on. The world of cloud. We've gone from no cloud to everything in the cloud. Neither of those statements make any sense nor are they ever true. We've been deploying cloud capabilities internally and externally for some time. The volume of those capabilities will grow, continue to grow. You can see here we've mapped out how we anticipate an increasing proportion of those applications, the 1,600 that we're tracking towards, will be hosted in a combination of our mainframe, other traditional distributed infrastructure but, importantly, the build in both external and internal cloud. Now that has an advantage from a cost perspective for some of those services, but not all. So where it makes sense, we'll do that. From a resilience perspective, there are inherent advantages in, for example, some companies supporting their own applications through an integrated solution.</p><p>And for us, the cost and the time to spin up new environments. Back in 2014, it would take, on average, 6 weeks if we wanted to embark on a new initiative to spin up the environment that allowed our developers to start working on that in a material way and to deploy new capability for the organization. It now takes me less than 30 minutes. Now might think 20 minutes is better and 10 minutes is better. 30 minutes gives you enough time to get yourself a coffee, get your head together and get on then with producing and using those capabilities. So that's the transformation that we're seeing of our capabilities in delivering new services for our customers.</p><p>I quite like this slide. I hope you do, too. It shows you on the bottom of this slide the volume of change that we have had to deliver that has been decided for us in the last, what, 3, 4 years. By the way, it's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of regulatory challenge, but I'll put those out there because these are some of the more substantial external demands on our time. Now we could have been completely consumed by that work, but we haven't been. What I show you on the top line are all the things that we've done in terms of deliverables for this bank that have enhanced our platform during that same window. It would have been very easy because regulatory and things you're told to do are a lot easier to do. You can just say, well, actually, I've got to do it. The other stuff, you had a choice about.</p><p>Two things I'm particularly proud of. The quality of the work we've done on the bottom line there. Our APIs were delivered on time for open banking. Now you might say that's obvious. Well, that's not true of every participant. In fact, it's true of only a small subset of the participants. So delivered on time of the highest quality. Future clearing. We've been ready and ahead of the rest of the industry.</p><p>And Brexit preparation, I'll tell you a story. I got a call a week before the deadline, the second one in April, and I was asked by somebody who works for another financial institution in the U.K. what we were planning to do in terms of the migration of our customers to an entity somewhere in Europe to transition our payments and were we going to do a big bang on that day in April or were you going to actually not be compliant for a period of time and just phase in the first important one and then run it over time.</p><p>And I said to them, \"Actually, we're done. We moved all our customers to that gateway a couple of months back.\" So actually, all I have to do on the day is to change the label, but all the engineering has been done. So we delivered Brexit on time, which is more than certainly the government has. And certainly, you can see in the comment I've made that the approach of some of our competitors wasn't as well prepared, I'd suggest, as the work that we've done.</p><p>So the other thing is an overlay to this. Remember, we were the bank that actually had the even more special treat of the overlay of Williams &amp; Glyn. So while we were doing all this, we were having to deliver a new bank. And as you're all aware, that was a significant overhead on the organization. I personally was consumed in looking to steer and to navigate that with a very big team within the organization looking to stand up what made no sense as we've said before just in terms of the scale of that, I mean, a brand-new broad-based bank. So that was the overhead, at the same time all this was done.</p><p>And by the way, that top line there, you haven't seen a single disruption to our service through the delivery of -- did you hear about people not getting paid? It's a pretty material change putting a new payroll system out there. Did you hear about actually us struggling to get the numbers out? So we put a new ledger in. Bankline, which we delivered for our customers, all this is being done to a high quality. And by the way, it sort of works, right? People quite like this stuff. I'll say some more about that.</p><p>When we launched the program back in 2014, we said there were the 4 dimensions I mentioned earlier. We also said we were going to invest in 6 areas. Firstly, distribution, and you can see that with our new Bankline and with our mobile platform, for example; secondly, the simplification of our estate, and you can see that in the metrics that I put out there; thirdly, in the area of data, and I'll come back to that; fourth, payments, the simplification and the enhancement of our capabilities there; and 2 other things. One was our base infrastructure. It's not often that gets called out. People like to talk about things other than that. But actually, we're seeing a peace dividend for the investment that we made in the base infrastructure.</p><p>But the last thing we said we'd do was invest in workforce enablement, we called it. Now my first day in this job -- actually, before I started, I was living in Singapore and I decided to go and meet some of my new colleagues in RBS in Singapore. So I went into the office and I said, \"So how do I get onto the network?\" And they said, \"We don't have one.\" I said, \"You're joking.\" I actually used the guest network of ANZ downstairs to actually access the services the first day. There isn't a part of this bank now that doesn't have not only WiFi but has the highest-quality WiFi, our entire branch network, our entire Indian operation because we need the bandwidth for the services we're now putting through.</p><p>4 years ago, the only company on the planet that used Facebook at work were a company called Facebook. And actually, Kevin and his team, at my suggestion, actually, walked through the front door of Facebook and said, \"You're using it to run your company. We've got all these things like Yammer and so on that actually, to be honest, people don't use outside of the workplace. People are already using Facebook around work with closed groups and so on. It's inevitable you're going to end up in the workplace. Why don't you work with us?\"</p><p>And there's somebody -- actually, Sean Ryan, who's one of the senior executives in Facebook, who said -- actually, he was told to meet Kevin and the team for breakfast in London to discuss this proposition. And he tells the story that, actually, at least he thought he was going to get breakfast, right? Out of that meeting, we became the first significant company on the planet to deploy Facebook at work became Workplace. We've got 75,000 people using that platform.</p><p>And I'd suggest that one of the drivers of the engagement scores in the organization is, by the way, not a minute's training in terms of the delivery of that platform. So 75,000 people being able to share in a positive sense what they want to within the work environment. We can live stream and do from anywhere to anyone and not only Ross, myself but actually anybody in this organization. So we don't control that. We don't say you can't do it. We let people actually be grown-ups and determine what they think makes sense for others and if people don't listen then --.</p><p>The virtual desktop on here. The end of the winter last year, I think it was, we couldn't actually get anybody into the building certainly in Scotland. Back in 2014, it would be an absolute disaster. You had no access to any services at all. Now 75,000 people essentially in this bank can work from home. And obviously, if you need some of the access to some of the services in the call center, not everything is done from home and the same with the branches for good reason as well. But that day, there were about 2 of us in the office in Gogarburn. Literally, the whole organization didn't miss a heartbeat, and people could work from home. So using that infrastructure to actually continue to run this organization.</p><p>Zoom, which you may have heard of, is now the tool of choice here. By the way, we do this stuff for the whole bank. We don't have different departments doing it. Hopefully, you get the sense that this is one program of work for one organization, and that's a key differentiator. 38,000 of our colleagues, it was none at the beginning of this year, can now access Zoom and can actually structure meetings that allow them to meet with their colleagues across the organization. It will be the same 75,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>That has allowed us, these initiatives and then many more in here, to reduce our property footprint quite substantially. As you've seen -- I remember when I arrived here, we had Bankside 1 and 2, they have gone; Aldgate Union is gone; Premier Place is gone; 135 Bishopsgate is gone; 280 Bishopsgate is going. So we're literally coming down now to here and a building in Islington that used to be a cash center. That is where we do a lot of our innovation. So the property costs have come down quite substantially.</p><p>And we've seen a dramatic reduction in our T&amp;E expense. And actually, that's continuing. It's actually picking up pace. We see here 13% T&amp;E costs. I have actually reduced my travel expense, not my personal one, yes, well actually, even mine as well, but actually, my organization's travel expense by 50% this year on the run rate for last year. These are material improvements in our cost to deliver through the delivery of technology across the organization.</p><p>I talked about the simplification of our portfolio and from 5,000 applications now to 2,100. What you see here are some of the new things that we've done. So these are some of the active things, the first paperless mortgage in the U.K. By the way, the NPS scores of these new capabilities is substantially above some of those legacies in the 50s and the 60s. That's what we expect.</p><p>I mentioned earlier Bankline and the investment we've made in the mobile platform there. We are the only bank in the U.K., I think, that provides a mobile-based service for commercial businesses that allow them to authenticate and approve payments without having to go to a desktop and actually use their mobile device. So that's a differentiator and actually something that we know is highly valued.</p><p>I'm going to talk more about Mimo, but Mimo is a new service that we have delivered to an increasingly large number of our colleagues and customers that uses our data to serve our customers in an enhanced way over anything that we've done historically. I'll say a little bit more about it later.</p><p>Now I often get asked about our core platform because, apparently, it's spaghetti, it's a piece of old junk, and actually, we should just throw it away and we should replace it with some beautiful thing out of the cupboard. The reality is it's not, right? It is actually a, on the whole, brand-new set of hardware with a brand-new set of software. Some of the software might have been written some time ago, but it's current versions of that, yes? And actually, it's a very modular environment and one that we continue to enhance. What was a very complicated and more integrated platform historically through the introduction of new capabilities, particularly the APIs, we're opening up to an evolution of performance and capability.</p><p>What this diagram shows -- it's one that Kevin and I put this together about 3 years ago, maybe a bit more actually, was that we expected to be in a world where we weren't the only interface ultimately to the customer base out there and that what we were going to have to do increasingly was to, and this was ahead of open banking actually and the delivery of those APIs, but we were going to be delivering the services of others through APIs to our customers and that we'd be looking to deliver services through others and their APIs to their customers. And that's essentially what this shows.</p><p>And what it shows is our banking platform supporting all of that. And there are many details, and I'm happy to touch on more of that later, of interest in terms of how we're using our core platform to service not just our so-called legacy but, actually, the future capabilities that we're building. So no need for some wholesale replatforming of this bank. We can be as agile and clearly as robust and resilient as others through the enhancement of this platform.</p><p>One thing I will call out, though, is that it's a job that's not done. So what I get a chance for my team to focus in on is addressing the challenge we have currently of the focusing of pricing around the needs of our customers. Ultimately, where would we like to get to? We'd like to get to a situation where the pricing reflected the needs of 19 million individuals as opposed to what we have currently, which is pricing, which is dispersed through our systems. And therefore, we're in the process of extracting pricing from the underlying systems, our core and others, into a utility that will allow us to price connected to our data with intelligence. So that's really targeted. That's not basically a wholesale replacement. There are so many aspects of the core system that just function that just to replace them would be a large expense to get back to where we are today and, in some cases, a worse situation.</p><p>By the way, one of the other observations I'd make around these core replacements is just the trail of global challenge around the delivery of these platforms and then the -- for some, the regrets downstream of the lack of focus on every other aspect of the estate because pretty much everything stopped for them when they went to replace their core. And they are in the process of if they've made any progress on the core on catching up and, in many cases, made no progress on the core and just burned through a lot of cash.</p><p>Now I talked about our APIs. I was told to explain what an API is. Who knows what an API is? Nobody? Ross does. Ross is --- go on, Ross, what's an API, [mate]? No. No, it's an application programming interface. There we are, there's a very clear definition. One -- if you can imagine, if this is helpful, that -- and somebody gave me the analogy recently actually and I've tried a few. But if you're in a restaurant and there are many customers and there are many chefs, as there are in many restaurants, the way in which we once operated was essentially as the customer that reference restaurant, I read the menu. I would then go and find the chef ultimately who's going to prepare whatever my option and choice was on that menu. So just imagine, a very large restaurant, lots of chefs and lots of customers.</p><p>The introduction of a waiter transforms that experience. So I, as a customer, look at the entire palette and gamut of what's available to me, and I conclude I want the chicken Kiev. I tell the waiter. I don't have to worry about which chef is going to produce it. I just know that the waiter is going to be able to perform that function for me. The waiter then goes into the kitchen. He finds the appropriate chef. The chef produces the appropriate meal. He gives it back to the waiter because it's not the chef that brings it to the table, it's the waiter. And you get the meal that you wanted. So rather than the point-to-point customer to chef, I've gone to a customer to API, to provider of service. Hopefully, that helps. If you all knew that already, that's great. And if it didn't help, I'm happy to be advised otherwise. But that's a sense of what we've done. It's a reengineering of the way that we access the services that we serve up to our customers. You might have also heard of the term microservices. What we had historically were larger conglomerations of services. And as we engineer through this environment, we're breaking those out into smaller services. So rather than a meal, it's a chicken Kiev. There we go. I won't take this analogy any further.</p><p>But -- so we decided sometime back -- actually, when we launched this whole program 5 years ago, that investing what we called our enablers, but the APIs was where we needed to invest. And that was a decision on behalf of all of us, right? We got ahead of the curve with open banking. Open banking has been helpful in the fact that it has forced the industry as a whole to adopt some of these approaches in technology. Why is that helpful? Because, actually, it allows us now to aggregate the accounts of the other banks for our customers, for example, through those APIs. But we have, and as you see here, produced some high-quality APIs.</p><p>One of the advantages of downsizing your and our investment bank or markets business was the access to some of the talent that we didn't need on the scale that we had historically. So we've kept a number of resources that previously were in our markets business that have been the builders of these APIs for our firm. That's led us to -- when you see the recent CMA ranking of the overall quality of these APIs, that we had 3 of the top 5 places. Those 3 banks were The Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Ulster Bank.</p><p>Now you might think everybody's produced these, but they haven't on time, and they also haven't produced them in the same quality. If our quality rankings were in the 90s, there are other banks out there that have quality rankings in the 30s. It makes them almost unusable in terms of those APIs. That makes us the partner of choice. That makes us somebody you might want to work with. The fact we've got these engineers, and these engineers are top quality. Why are we able to attract people increasingly from the FinTech community to come and work in this place? Because of the quality of the engineering talent in this organization and the fact that people see that.</p><p>289 operational APIs to date. There'll be 580-odd by the end of this year. I can access elements of our core banking system through these APIs as opposed to binding our new capabilities tightly to the old, if that makes any sense. So a partner of choice, high-quality work and we are a leader in that regard.</p><p>Now I said I'd mention data. It was one of our 6 priorities back in 2014. By the time we said we'd do 3 things, we said we'd clean up our data. We said we'd connect it up, which was to make it available effectively. And then thirdly, we said we'd use it and to use it to more effect than we have been doing that. It's clear that the major differentiator for an organization, certainly one that has 19 million customers and transactional history for many years and a lot of other data as it relates to those customers, is the ability to use that data to effectively service our customers.</p><p>There isn't a company that's been built of any substance in the last 10 years that hasn't built its proposition around the intelligence it derives from the data, not always well but profitably for those organizations to date. So 2 other dimensions that we've put into that portfolio of the -- what was to clean it up, connect it up and use it is to use it to a high standard of ethics. So we're publishing a set of standards by which we want to be held, which we're calling safe, which is about the value and how ethically we use ultimately that data.</p><p>And then the fifth element is education. If this is so central to the future intelligence of this organization, its capability, we'd better have an organization that fundamentally understands that. So we've launched a data academy. We've also set up with Edinburgh University on the -- in the base institute to build out our capabilities, other initiatives as well. So 2,500 of our colleagues are going through an education. In fact, we're doing some work ourselves later this week as my team to better understand the data agenda.</p><p>And importantly as well, we're also invested in a tiering. So we have very capable people in this organization who are acquiring data science and analytics skills as part of this academy as well. So there's the 2,500 really fundamentally understand the ethics, the insights and how to get the best out of the data and then those that are going to engineer that, being trained as part of this academy in conjunction with some of the best universities.</p><p>So that's our data agenda, which has led to -- I'm going to talk about one example of bringing all these ingredients together. You may have heard of Mimo, you may not. Mimo is a new, what we call, personal financial assistant that we're building for the 19 million customers that we have. It uses the intelligence and the insights from the data that we have to better support our customers. It provides nudges. It provides insights. It actually watches your income flow and informs you intelligently. It looks at your outgoings, informs you intelligently.</p><p>We used to leave that for you to discover for yourself. Actually, it's -- so it's a preemptive adviser, informer, assistant to the management of your financial needs around your transactional account. So it uses the data, but how does it deliver it? It uses these APIs. It uses the APIs to access this information. So we've spun this up, a new capability, in a matter of months using the underlying data, the old legacy, as we've described it, but it's not, the APIs. And we're delivering with a very ambitious plan, new quality insights for our customers.</p><p>By the way, it also has a set of services in there, which we're just scratching the surface with, we believe. We talk about ecosystems and attracts people. If we can provide that intelligence around existing relationships with these customers, we put a switching service in. So MoneySuperMarket is a switching service that allows you to switch utilities. We can see when your utilities come due. We can give you -- and by the way, you're in control. We're not going to do this to you. We're providing a supportive assistant to allow you to better manage your finances.</p><p>Also, we've used Direct Line as a provider of home insurance to those customers because we can see where people are buying property. We can see where people have housing insurances coming up for renewal. We're looking at what we can do from a life perspective. We're looking at what we can do from a pet perspective. We're looking at what we can do from a car perspective. These are all services, and all of these can potentially drive revenues to new levels.</p><p>Our personal bank this year believe that they've driven about GBP 87 million worth of new income from insights driven through intelligence, driven from the underlying data of our existing customers. [If you don't have] any customers, difficult to do that.</p><p>All right. So I just wanted to show you and bring to life Mimo, if I could, a little bit more. So roll video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>Here we are. Any of you are customers of NatWest, feel free to sign up. Well, that's a service coming to you.</p><p>And with that, I'll hand over okay now to Christine, who will take us through the numbers in a bit more detail. Thanks.</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON, FINANCE DIRECTOR OF SERVICES &amp; FUNCTIONS, THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GROUP PLC: Thank you, Simon, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll have a drink for a start, it is my goal for the next sort of 5, 10 minutes sort of just to bring to life what Simon said in terms of financials.</p><p>So just starting off, I think it's well known we've reduced our costs significantly since 2014, and we've actually taken 30% out. We've not only taken that out for our legacy businesses, but our go-forward businesses have also significantly reduced. And I'll come on to talk about some of the changes in staff costs, property and technology. I'm also going to cover off some of our capitalization rule set and bring that a life, bring that to life for you all.</p><p>So it's the same slide that Simon had up earlier but added some additional stats to the bottom. We've consistently invested over GBP 1 billion in our business, but what has changed is the mix of that spend. So back in 2014, our spend was dominated by mandatory and reg programs and the nonring-fenced bank. That significantly changed and we've flipped that ratio with now less than 40% spent in that category. That's enabled us to invest in the new technology that Simon has referred to and really changed the innovation and where we invest.</p><p>So if you look at something like mortgages, back in 2014, it was all roundabout MMR and getting ready to fix our GMS system that we'd underinvested in. What we're now spending in mortgages is new capability such as paperless and different propositions for customers. We funded that in part through a reduction in mandatory spend, and I think the trend will only continue in the mandatory spend of reducing costs there. Whether that's the investment that we've done to date, the further investment in the technology transformation towards cloud, but also that we've got far less systems to decommission than we had before. Mortgage manager is an example of something that we've moved off. Therefore, we no longer need to continue investing the same in decommissioning.</p><p>So in terms of how some of this activity plays into our financials. If I start with the franchises, we've invested heavily in turning our business into digital first. So in terms of PB, back in 2014, only 26% of our sales activity would be digital, not through branches. To date -- or last year, that stat has increased to 46%. And of course, in terms of customers' ability to self-serve on mortgages, for example, that's also increased. So back in 2017, only 53% of customers transacted online to switch their mortgage. Last year, that increased to 61%.</p><p>Simon was highlighting we've also invested in data. Simon talked about how that improved things for customers and created income opportunities. That's also enabled us to reduce our costs. We are more targeted in our approach and combining with mobile to contact customers that helps us reduce our cost of activity.</p><p>Looking more to the commercial bank, Bankline, activity there is also significantly up. Back in 2015, we only had 1.4 million transactions per month. Last year, that increased to 2.6 million. I think these are some of the drivers that have helped us really lower the staff costs that you can see on the slide, and I would anticipate this journey to continue. Our investment hasn't slowed, and customers' demand to do things for themselves rather than visit branches isn't changing. It's fair to say we've not only reduced our staff costs but also the costs that are the infrastructure of our business.</p><p>If I look at property, we've significantly reduced the scale and cost of our property footprint, and this is despite headwinds in terms of some inflations on our cost. You can see we've dramatically reduced the cost. I think that change will definitely continue. We're exiting more buildings in 2018 and some that cost us considerable amounts of money. Simon has mentioned the footprint that has dropped in London, and I think the evidence that we're here today and not in our previous building of 280 is a key point in what will change our cost base again in 2020.</p><p>And that the scale of cost reduction in property has been [embedded] in technology. The activity that Simon described doesn't just make us more secure and able to innovate, it's also significantly reduced our cost base. I think costs will continue to fall in our technology space but probably at a slightly slower pace as we continue to invest in technology and the landscape of our cost base changes slightly.</p><p>Lastly, I'm just going to bring to life our (inaudible) in terms of what we do in capitalization. So there's 2 criteria that really bring to life what we capitalize and why is the number quite low. So our first test, if you like, is the type of spend. We broadly only capitalize technology spend. Technology spend it varies year-to-year, but probably 65%, 70% of our investment spend is technology. So as a first gatepost, not everything is available to be capitalized. And then the second test is only technology cost that is spent on a project where it has a positive NPV and a cumulative spend of more than GBP 5 million will be capitalized. So the slide says -- in this year, we're planning to capitalize just shy of 40% that is only for technology spend. So actually, in totality of our investment spend each year, we probably capitalize something in the region of 25% to 30%. So I don't believe we are building up a significant headwind for the future. I believe we've got a really sensible approach.</p><p>And I think another fact that brings that to life, we test every quarter what we've got on the balance sheet and is it appropriate for it still to be there. Last year, in terms of the numbers that we believed were no longer appropriate, it came to a sum of GBP 37 million. Given the level of spend we've been doing on an annual basis, a very small amount. So I have no doubt when we come to Q&amp;A, there may be some more questions, but hopefully, that gives you comfort in terms of we've been spending a lot of money, but we've not been building up a headwind in terms of our future profitability. We've been dealing with the costs as and when we spend them.</p><p>And I will now hand to Kevin, who will talk to innovation. Most of you can see Kevin is on crutches, so he may take a moment to get to the stage.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY, DIRECTOR OF INNOVATION, THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GROUP PLC: Nicely done. I was looking at Simon very enviously as he was moving about the stage here as they -- I've got mobility envy is what I have. I have to be propped up by a stool. My -- it's funny. My doctor, as he reattached my Achilles 3 weeks ago, he said 3 things to me. He said stay off your feet, don't go to work and avoid large public gatherings. So I've managed to avoid all 3 pieces of advice.</p><p>But what I really wanted to do was just bring to life some of our -- some of the innovation agenda. As Simon says, we've probably been at this for about 5 years now with real focus and attention. I still remember my very first conversation with Simon in the job when he joined 5 years ago, and he talked very eloquently about how -- if we wanted to up our innovation game, then we needed to immerse ourselves in the world's most innovative ecosystems. I think his phrase was, \"You can't do that, sat in Bishopsgate. You need to go and do something about it.\"</p><p>And that's precisely what we did, actually, and I'll talk a little bit about it. But we put ourselves out there. We've learned from some of the smartest on the planet. We contributed to the ecosystems that we've been a part of. We met a whole load of smart people and smart companies, and we're increasingly doing things with those people and companies that we meet. So let me just try and bring that to life.</p><p>I guess what we talk about internally around innovation, assets, and I know a number of you have seen this slide before, the right-hand side of this slide, I'll talk about first. So again, if you go back 3, 4, 5 years, we focused heavily on establishing our scouting and research capability around the world, and that includes things like putting a small team on the ground in Silicon Valley. That team has been there for about 5 years. Now that team alone, just to give you a sense of what we do there, that team alone, I think that something like 1,000 companies in its first year in the Valley we meet with, everyone from start-up companies to the bigger companies on the West Coast, the educational establishments on the West Coast, whether that be the likes of Stanford or Singularity University, which is the think tank on the NASA Ames field on the West Coast that looks at exponential technology and disruptive technology and how it's changing business models around the world and how you deploy and use that technology to solve some of the world's grand challenges. But we meet with organizations, institutions like that, all of the VCs on the West Coast that back those companies. And we've started to build -- we've built over the last 3, 4, 5 years, I think, an enviable network of relationships that we leverage today.</p><p>Another example, we're heavily immersed in the Israeli ecosystem different engagement model. We don't have a team on the ground there that's a much more curated facilitated engagement process working with the likes of the UK Israel Tech Hub, which is the government agency that helps -- acts as an introduction agency between our needs and the companies that are in Israel. Simon and I were talking about it a little bit earlier. Actually, Simon, Ross, Alison and others were in Israel earlier on in the year, and we were hosted by the British Ambassador, which, if nothing else, gives you a sense of our standing in the community.</p><p>But we were talking there to the people in attendance about our Israeli track record, and we just put some stats together for that. And in Israel, I think we've met over 300 Israeli companies, but more importantly, we've done 30, what we call, proof of concepts on minimum viable products. And then more importantly, we've taken 11 of those proof of concepts. And I could talk about 11 pieces of Israeli technology that we are -- that we have in production at the moment and we are scaling for the benefit of our customers.</p><p>And when you stand in Tel Aviv and tell those kind of stories to an investment community, to a start-up community, it's probably why that invite to the British Embassy was there. It was so called the hottest ticket in town for this year. So it's -- I guess it's a reflection of rather than just put boots on the ground or put a badge above a facility, we get measured by what we do and how we do it rather than just the number of people on the ground. So Israel, a big location for us.</p><p>Our open experience centers, these are the physical locations where we have, I guess, unapologetically borrowed, stolen, I'm not quite sure. We've certainly leveraged the configurable, adaptive, creative spaces that you'd see in places like the d.school of Stanford, it's our physical locations in London and Edinburgh, where we work with the partners and the companies that we meet with around the world. And the space literally can be reconfigured as some of the opportunities I'll describe in a moment grow and scale.</p><p>Simon has mentioned the engineering capability. We've got dedicated engineers that let us stand up our work quickly, and I guess with a speed, that's enviable. All of that's great. I actually think that lots of the secret of our success lies in what probably looks like the dull but I think the most important left-hand side of this slide. I think we have established -- anyone that's kind of looked at the world of innovation, the ability to act at speed and get the sponsorship of senior management is massively key to success. And what Simon and Ross did, I want to say 3 years ago now, I think was establish the innovation forum. And this is the monthly forum within the bank that's attended by the bank's most senior people. It's attended by Ross. Ross has never missed one, actually. In 3 years, he's never missed an innovation forum. Ross, Simon, the CEOs of each of our franchise -- each of our franchises.</p><p>But it's the monthly forum where it's always hosted by one of our partners. We spend the first part of the session discussing, sharing our views on innovation with the people that are hosting the session. And then literally, they leave the room, and we spend the remaining 4 hours of the session managing, overseeing, sponsoring, funding our innovation portfolios. You see there, we have a dedicated innovation fund that says for the opportunities that come to that forum, we have the ability to fund those immediately.</p><p>Now that sounds as I say it's sounds dry. But what it does mean is literally when we meet some of the companies I'm about to describe, we are never more than 4 weeks away from getting funding and sponsorship to start an innovation project within the bank. And as I say, I could give you examples where we meet a company. I could talk about Soul Machines that many of you will know, which is the company that we work with to stand up the world's first digital human avatar. We met that company in Auckland on a wet Wednesday in October. And within 3.5 weeks, we'd been to the innovation forum and received funding for the pilot work. And within 12 weeks, we'd stood up the world's first digital human avatar, that then went -- that was a publicly -- globally publicly newsworthy story about 18 months ago. I get excited about the speed with which that happened as much as the technology that we were deploying.</p><p>So I think the left-hand side of this is massively important, what we've done over the course of the past couple of years as well as we benefit massively from the technology advisory board that we have put in place. So again, leveraging the network on the right-hand side as we meet smart people, smart companies. We often badger them to join our advisory board. So we have some of the world's smartest people advising us on a quarterly basis, and that's everyone from the Polish businesswoman of the year through to global leaders in the AI space, recognized global experts in ethical hacking, start-up CEO, entrepreneurs, somebody who's been on the board of the BBC and has got -- and has had great responsibility for running line technology organizations.</p><p>It's a mixture of all of those capabilities, I think, that makes a massive difference. And then internally, as a subset of the board, we've formally set up a technology and innovation committee to make sure that the story that we're telling here gets sufficient governance and oversight and input from the board.</p><p>So I think the left-hand side, massively important. It was -- not that we ever needed any reassurance, but again, some of us were talking earlier. We had -- I think it was a group of about 25 of Simon's peers, so the CAOs of European financial services organizations with us at the beginning of last year, actually, and we were going through sort of a week-long conversion of this story where we were all sort of sharing our innovation stories. And without exception, the one thing that everyone said at the end of the week was that they wished they'd had the left-hand side of this slide.</p><p>Now literally did they mean they wanted an innovation forum and fund, I'm not quite sure, but they absolutely meant that they recognized that the amount of time and effort and sponsorship and the ability to move at speed that we have through the forum and the fund is massively advantageous to us. Taken together, I think those assets provide a really strong foundation, a really strong platform for success in the innovation space and also experience. It takes time to do all of that. So what I'm describing here I don't think is easily replicated, at least not quickly.</p><p>The net result, I think, of all of those innovation assets is that we have developed a rich network of, and I'll prop myself up on the stool for a moment now, a rich network of companies that we partner with, that we collaborate with around the world. There's a selection of them on this slide. Actually, the criteria for making the slide is it's not just a company that we've met, every company that's listed on that slide, we have worked with, are working with, have a formal relationship with, and you can see the breadth of what's mentioned there.</p><p>I think just to go back to Simon's point earlier, when Simon talked about the future shape of the organization, if you believe as I do that the future success of this organization lies in combining our assets and services with the assets and services of others to do new and unique and insightful things that are valued and trusted by customers, that's all well and good. But unless you have the network and the depth of relationships with some of the players here, then it doesn't amount to an awful lot. So the real secret sauce is in not only understanding these companies and having a relationship with them but the ability to do something with them.</p><p>And as you see, it's a broad spectrum of companies ranging from investments in quantum computing, software companies through to collaborations with Soul Machine, through to biometric security, through to artificial intelligence, through Watson. Simon mentioned Facebook, Singularity University, et cetera. The beauty lies in its breadth and depth.</p><p>Maybe before we move on to a few examples, I think just something I want to mention here. I'm sure we'll come back and talk to it either in Q&amp;A or subsequently. But one of the things that we also do, which I think will ultimately be really beneficial to the organization, is that we measure innovation across the organization. This is something that we've been really focused on over the last 6 months. Many of you in the room have prompted our thinking as well.</p><p>And we recognized that there's no singular measure for innovation that tells the whole story. We need to look at a bundle of measures. We need to look at our collection of measures to paint the picture. I actually think that the logic for the way that we think about innovation, the way that we measure it is kind of quite valuable and prompting really valuable conversations within the organization as well. So we go back to our definition. For something to be innovative, it needs to fall into a definition that's got 3 components, so for something to be innovative in our language at least, it needs to be a new idea, it needs to be executed, and it needs to have meaningful impact. So did we have a new idea? Did we do something with it? And did it have a meaningful impact?</p><p>Those are the 3 elements that make some think innovative. If you do 1 or 2 of those things, it's useful but not particularly innovative. So you can have a new idea, but unless you do something with it, it doesn't amount to anything. You can have a new idea. You can put something into production, which is kind of nice but potentially irrelevant. You kind of need to do something at scale, is where the real value is. It's a combination of the 3 that is -- that's important.</p><p>Just to give you a sense of what we track, in effect, the progression from left to right across the screen. And I could give you lots of metrics, but the one I will give you is the -- if you look at 2018, we had over 475 items that we classified under the ideation category. So 475 ideas, 41 of those progressed to proof of concept or minimum viable product, and 11 of those progressed to impact at the scale as we would call it, so 475 into 41 into 11. And Simon and I and others have spoken to many VCs around the world actually where they talk about kind of the way that they think about financial investment, and the comparison doesn't quite work. But if you imagine a VC kind of looking at number of bets placed, a number of items considered and number of bets placed and eventual success, when you look at our ratio of 475:40:11, I think that's a ratio -- would tell that's a ratio that stands comparison to any other -- to any of our peers certainly.</p><p>The ability to progress things into production and to do things at scale is the goal. All that is good. What are we doing about it? What are we doing about it? What's coming up? Maybe before I talk about some of these, if you go back and think about the innovation portfolio, the innovation portfolio is comprised of probably at any one time something like 25 smaller experimental proof of concepts and so on and so forth, but we're also making bigger bets and seeking to scale a number of our new businesses. Many of these -- or some of these will be known to you. Simon has mentioned some of them as well.</p><p>Let me maybe just touch on a few that we haven't mentioned so far. Maybe on the right-hand side first actually. Esme, many of you will know, actually Esme launched last year. It's our new direct lending proposition to small- to medium-sized enterprises, making loans available of up to GBP 150,000 within 10 minutes. It's simple. It's paperless. It's digital -- entirely digital actually. Customers love it. It's safe. It's secure. It's underwritten by NatWest. Scores really well on Net Promoter Scores. I think the last time we looked to that, which was the end of last year, beginning of this year, NPS scores of around 76. I think to date, we have probably written coming up to our 1,000th loan, and we've probably lent over GBP 60 million to new businesses in the U.K. since its launch, is the world of Esme.</p><p>Where should we go next? Path. Path is a -- I think Path is exciting. Path is in beta testing at the moment. Path is a new way for small- to medium-sized enterprises to manage their employees, their data and all of their HR processes and do that in a safe and secure way, keeping up-to-date on legislative changes. It is most valuable -- I guess, the sweet spot of SMEs that it's targeting are probably SMEs with about 50 employees that are probably using spreadsheets to kind of manage that process at the moment, and they need advice and help on staying up-to-date with the latest compliance legislation. It will launch -- this is where I get into trouble. It will launch certainly to the wider market in H2 of this year, so keep an eye out for that.</p><p>Mimo, Simon just spoke about it, but the companion app for and NatWest Personal, some of those offering a range of insights. And CurrencyPay on the left-hand side. CurrencyPay is taking our NatWest Markets FX business and really bringing it to bear for our retail and corporate franchises in a -- I guess, in a really powerful way. So it plays as an international payments engine directly in the middle of a current account or business banking workflows.</p><p>But I wanted to spend a little bit of time just diving into maybe just some of the others in a fraction more detail. Let's look at Mettle first. Mettle, I think Simon mentioned new standalone, independent digital banking proposition for small businesses, again, specifically designed for entrepreneurs and growing businesses to manage their finances. It combines a current account with invoicing, payments chasing, bookkeeping, bookkeeping capabilities wrapped up in a single app and debit card.</p><p>We've just announced actually -- you might have seen, we just announced the new CEO of Mettle. The first CEO, a woman called Marieke Flament, joins us from Circle in Q3 of this year. And I'm going to say that Mettle will be in an app store near you sometime in August. Our comms team just scowled at me as I said that, so -- but no, August, I think, for Mettle.</p><p>Tyl, we're probably being relatively quiet about so far. I think it's going to be a big new story in the second half of the year. Tyl is our reentry back into the merchant acquiring space designed to make life easier for customers and businesses to run their small and larger businesses. It makes customer onboarding really straightforward, provides a sophisticated card acquiring capability. And frankly, it helps -- or it provides them with the tools to help them manage and grow their businesses and get back to the communities that they serve.</p><p>And just a few words about APtimise before we run the video but APtimise is, I guess, another in the bundle of capabilities that we're providing. And this is increasingly how we look at the world of what we do in the innovation space rather than think about these discretely, if you think about sort of how some of these capabilities combine and come together to better serve our customers, they start to get really powerful. APtimise, as you'll see in a moment, is the U.K.'s only end-to-end accounts payable solution for small businesses and helps small businesses spend less time processing invoices -- spend less time processing invoices and more time growing their business. But let me just show a short video, and then we'll wrap up this section.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: Okay. So maybe just sort of the risk of repeating myself. I think if you look at things like APtimise in accounts payable or you look at lending through Esme, you look at the business banking capability of Mettle, the ability to manage employees and their needs through Path, I think when you start to combine those, I think you start to get a really powerful portfolio of capabilities that support our SME marketplace and I think it provides them with the tools, the advice, the access that they need to start and scale up and grow their businesses.</p><p>I want to say one more story. I know that we are running slightly late. One more story, B\u00c3\u00b3 will be a big story in the second half of the year. I know that many of you will be familiar with B\u00c3\u00b3 already, the companion banking account from NatWest for both existing and new personal customers, really designed to appeal to people who -- I think the tagline is appealing to people who need to do money better, who need to take control of their own finances.</p><p>We did some customer research very early on in the process and found out that 50% of all of our customers spend what they earn on a monthly basis and an additional 25% of customers spend more than they earn on a monthly basis, which frankly means when you combine those 2 stories, the ability to take control of your finances through behavioral insights that are offered up through some of the data work that Simon was describing earlier, if you can offer up behavioral insights that can be action to put people in control of their finances, we believe that that's groundbreaking and particularly valuable to our customers. It is in private beta testing at the moment, but we will be making much more of a noise about it in the second half of the year.</p><p>This thing is flashing at me, so I am going to stop there. I didn't get the chance to talk about -- there's lots more I could have talked about. We could have talked about AI. We could have talked about chatbots. We could have talked about the voice work that we are doing with Google in particular. We could have talked more about digital humans. I could have talked about distributed ledger technology. I could have talked about biometrics, but maybe that's for Q&amp;A or for another day perhaps.</p><p>But maybe let me hand it back to Simon for a wrap-up, and then we'll do some Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Thanks, Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: Takes me a while to move away now. I can't hobble as quickly as anybody.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: You just stand there.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: I'll stand here. Just talk around that.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: [I'll do my review]. He's got in our way. (inaudible) clicker. You're right. So there's plenty of other things he didn't talk about, but obviously, we can come back to that in the Q&amp;A. We'll get there in a second. But just before we do that, I just want to put this slide up because I wanted to be very clear on these 3 things. Personally, we don't need a core replacement. Yes. We've been reengineering this core over the last 5 years, and we will continue to evolve. But you're right.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: I was making up words.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: No, no, be quiet about it, if you? So no core platform replacement needed. We will continue to evolve our core, and we can focus in on the pieces that will make the difference as opposed to actually address things that really won't make a difference.</p><p>Our legacy platform's an asset. 19 million customers is a good thing, yes? Having all that data and all that information is a good thing, all right? So you can talk about this as a legacy, but a legacy can be a good thing.</p><p>And lastly, the comment that has been made that we're behind our peers in our agility and ability to make changes rapidly, hopefully, you've heard some of the things. But we spin up these solutions as quick as anyone. Some of that decision-making is more agile than you'd see because, actually, the funding's available to us. Some of these other guys have to go out and actually find the funding having to come up with a good idea. We've got access to those resources, for example. So we're not the laggard in that regard.</p><p>So to summarize, firstly, we have a resilient and agile platform, right? That's an asset. Two, we use data, the APIs and innovation. I'm glad we whispered innovation because you can see what it's yielded.</p><p>We're increasingly spending less, if that's the right phrase, on our mandatory work and investing in discretionary and new capabilities. The regulatory agenda has been a big challenge for us, but we've actually addressed what we've had to and we've done it well.</p><p>Our strategy is about driving costs down whilst enhancing customer experience. They're not mutually exclusive things, and you've seen the results of that to date, a lot of new capability that's actually delivered as we've reduced the overall cost base.</p><p>And lastly, I'd consider our platform, our people, our customers, our partnerships and you saw some of those, our data, and importantly, our track record for delivery, it makes us one of the leading digital banks in the U.K. It's interesting in the last week, and it is rather nice to read a couple of reports from a couple of you in the room that started to call that out as a differentiator, existing in the top quadrant, the Magic Quadrant, delivering capabilities that differentiate us and who should you worry about, yes, and seeing actually the -- these capabilities I've just laid out as being actually where you might want to invest.</p><p>So that's really all I had to say. Hopefully, that was informative for you all. We're very happy now to take any questions you might have on your mind. We've obviously thrown quite a lot of data in the room, myself, Christine or Kevin. Yes? How are we doing this? We'll just...</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Indeed, RBS is a smart company. You created an ecosystem, which is based on open infrastructure with APIs. You are ahead of the pack in creating a bundle of capabilities. However, you measure your success in the context of the banking section. The real threat is really not coming from banks but potentially from big tech. So just wondering whether you can comment on the recent announcement of Facebook. I see the proposition is very enticing, potentially is a good application. The payment system is embedded in the messaging services. We've seen these products or service already very successful in other jurisdictions in Asia. I believe big techs are better than banks in creating digital services. You also have a larger customer base. You mentioned 19 million. Potentially, these companies have billions of clients. There are, on the other side, some warnings and some issues. One is credibility obviously. The second one is regulation. We can also mention concentration of power within a limited number of large corporates. So I'm just wondering what is your thinking. And by the way, can you move the conversation forward?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Yes, I'm might say something just as a start, but I think, obviously, we watch these developments with interest. I think we've certainly got ourselves, hopefully, you've seen, embedded in the system. Facebook are not only potentially a competitor, but they're clearly a partner of ours as well. And that's true of a number of these big techs. I think the important thing for us is actually being in the game. And I think one of the statements often made is keep your friends close and your enemies closer. We don't know in this environment exactly who's who in the mix. What I would say is that actually going to the engagement with any of these, whether they be the small techs, big techs, having a credibility and a capability that clearly can be perceived to have value in any arrangement, I think that -- that's our calling card. And I think actually that's working well for us. So our engagement at the present moment with all of these organizations is quite a healthy one, right? But obviously, there's a threat in there as well. So yes, I think it's a very interesting development. It's not unflagged I suppose. It's one of a number across those organizers maybe more to come. So per se, I think we're in the game, we're in the mix, and we're working with pretty much all these companies in some -- both sort of historical delivery method but also in some creative way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Do you think that will be open to banks as well in the future?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: May well be. Who knows? Probably best directed at Facebook, but I think, I'd say, I've explained the relationship we have with those guys. We sort of know them, and they're a large organization like we are. But actually I think one of the advantages of us having the footprint that we have and the focus we have is actually the ability to work as one with any of these organizations. And we do bring the whole organization to the party when we actually do get together with these other organizations, which I think works very well.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: I thought Mark Carney's observation on Libra were spot on this week. I think it was a really nicely balanced kind of view that said Libra could have all sorts of advantages, not least of which for the underbanked in society. There's potential for real scale with sort of some of those that are already onboard. It's got the Ubers, the PayPals, the Spotifies, the Mastercards, the Visas of the world who are already sort of founding members. It's not just a Facebook thing. And it's got the potential to be significant, but there's a long way to go from a regulation and a legislative perspective in terms of how that plays out. And I got breakfast with Facebook at 8:00 tomorrow morning. So...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: And we know what happened in the last breakfast.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: It's [Alastair] on from Bank of America. Just to press you on the core platform then because you've been quite definitive, so I can invite (inaudible). But are you really saying you can't foresee a set of circumstances in which the data architecture is -- puts you at a disadvantage? So it's clear that you don't feel that's the case today. But at some level, is there an evolution that you can't manage? So is there a point in the future which it becomes a disadvantage? Or perhaps on a second way of the same question, which is does it -- have you found that you can do anything that you want with your core platform, but the cost of running it is higher than it would be if you had something else?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Yes. So I think there's a couple of aspects to that. So I think there's an ability to inhibitors doing things that we want to do. I don't see that. I don't foresee that. That doesn't mean to say that we wouldn't have to engineer capabilities into that platform or around that platform, and that's what we've done. I mean we didn't spin up our mobile platform embedded within the core platform as well, but we provide a real-time mobile capability to our customers that seems to work well for them. So I don't think it's an inhibitor from that point of view.</p><p>I think as you look at the cost base, clearly, we're running on a mainframe platform that's pretty effective for us for the volume of customers we have on there currently. As you've seen, we've quite substantially reduced our cost base over time, so I think the ongoing simplification. So I think we could make a burden for ourselves. I think we intend to very much make it an asset and to basically manage the expense base, the cost base in total. And I think it has some advantage there. So -- but it's not a done deal.</p><p>And the other thing is if you look at what's happening with those that get new to the technology as they build on, I mean how did we end up with all the systems we had? We used to have 1, and then we had 2. And then we had 3, and then we had 5,500, right? So how you steer that over time. And as you look to the tech companies, careful to say, but I mean some of the large tech companies don't have a uniformity and an architecture that actually works as well as it could do considering they've only been around for 10 years. So you can see the evidence of the learning of the same mistakes. I think the fact that we've already learned a number of those mistakes. I also think, coming back to the first question, that's also the potential benefit of these partnerships, which is if you take those ingredients, you've got a powerful combination as well. So hopefully, that sort of answered your question.</p><p>JASON CLIVE NAPIER, MD, HEAD OF EUROPEAN BANKS RESEARCH AND BANK RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Jason Napier from UBS. Just a question. I appreciate the group is almost in its final strategic shape under Ross in terms of international expansions and so on. But I just wonder whether there's anything in the new brands or the products that you're rolling out in the U.K. that makes them inappropriate for putting them in other markets. You've got the licenses for parts of Europe. Could you quite easily transfer them to that environment?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: We could do so then. That's a strategic choice. There's nothing inherently in what's been created. That means that they couldn't operate in other jurisdictions. You obviously have to tailor things. You always had to those markets, but I think, yes, you can. And in fact, we are working to find a method by which some of these could find their way to other markets with partners.</p><p>JASON CLIVE NAPIER: So in industry sort of terms, the collaboration is not geographically specific. You can (inaudible) it any way you want.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: No, no, not at all. Actually I think -- no, and I think, clearly, our customer base, as it currently stands, is very clearly defined and also the services we provide into it. And that's actually very helpful for those who want to partner with us as well to be honest. But it's not constrained that way. And so we found it very -- because we can't bring the organization together very quickly and very clearly into those opportunities with any of those partners if that makes sense. Yes, sure.</p><p>JAMES FREDERICK ALEXANDER INVINE, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: It's James Invine here from SocGen. I've got 2, please. The first is I was wondering if you could say a bit about branding please. So you've got lots of kind of new sub brands, it would appear, like B\u00c3\u00b3 and so on. How clearly from the customer's point of view are they going to be linked into RBS and NatWest? And how many of them are just going to be standalone? And then the second one is you've talked a lot about insights for the customer using their data. How much can you harness that for your own purposes for underwriting? I mean is this your capability is going to make your underwriting abilities much better than they are at the moment?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: So will take the 2. So do you want have a go at the first, Kevin, just in terms of...?</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: The branding thing, so I mean in my mind, I'm not sure if it's the official party line. I think we're almost one of the best of both worlds. So I think the separate branding recognizes the stand-alone significance of some of what we're doing, but it's almost fueled or powered by NatWest. I mean lots of the propositions want the safety, the security, the service that's underwritten by NatWest. So I think there's a -- I think there's -- it's you want the best. You want the best of both worlds. And I think that could play out really, really powerfully.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: I think we are a multi-brand institution currently, right? A lot of thought has gone into those brands and their purpose. I think there's nothing different or new in terms of the thought that's going into how the brands that we've created or sub brands that we've created and the relationship to the core. So I think it'll be different -- a different call for different propositions depending on specifically what we're looking to achieve with the customers with that. So -- but I think it's the level of intelligence and thought that goes into it as opposed to this isn't sort of a dispersion of focus. It's actually -- it's building a proposition. It's giving it an identity and then as part of that, determining what its relationship is to what we have already, if that makes sense. And that's both in terms of how we brand but also in terms of how we leverage the technology. One of the things that maybe didn't go is -- well, actually this is a portfolio, and it's stable and a lot of the underlying capabilities, so what we've just deployed for B\u00c3\u00b3 is about to be used for the entirety of the bank. That's a rather nice thing to do, and B\u00c3\u00b3 has been a beneficiary of work that's being done by the bank today.</p><p>On your underwriting point, I think there's a lot more opportunity there in terms of emerging and -- yes, and additional methodologies in terms of the determination of the suitability of those that we do business with, to put it like that. And I think our risk organization is increasingly focused around how we -- not just the data that we have -- I mean this is important thing as well. When we talk about data, I do have the data that's available through the 19 million customers I have here. I also now have access to a bunch of data from the other CME banks that have basically -- have opened up through open banking. That's only going to increase in terms of portfolio. So there's a broader set of data.</p><p>I don't have data that sits beyond that in terms of the data that comes in other members of the system. And therefore, that's why I think it's so central. The intelligence, the curation and the -- of the management of that data and even back to the previous point about do I see that as inhibitor, I think thinking through data and doing a job -- good job of it is going to be a differentiator. I don't see an inhibitor there, but you could make a real mess of it. And therefore, you do need to think about data beyond the traditional perimeters in terms of both the underwriting point but also in terms of other aspects of how you drive your model and how you drive insights. Yes, sorry, will come in a second.</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA, LEAD ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. On the technology spend, I think you, in one of the slides, said GBP 900 million technically to run cost. The total technology spend, am I right in my calculation is about closer to GBP 1.5 billion or something like that? And when you think about the more discretional amount that you can spend, you've increased, I think, you said 16%. But when you look forward, are we at the peak of investment given the -- a lot of the initiatives you run us through? Do you think that's going to continue growing, shrinking? Just give us a flavor of where we are in the development cycle. And maybe -- and excuse my ignorance if this is probably a stupid question. But B\u00c3\u00b3, is that -- it's not -- my understanding is, is it running on the mainframe platform? Or is it completely separate launch?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: No, it's like a lot of the services we have. They're running on -- that's running on a cloud platform that's suit up for that purpose as a lot of the other platforms are for example.</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA: Yes. But when I look forward years from now, is the fact I just want to understand the rationale for launching it that way versus what's sort of the legacy or the current bank, and if we're going to, in a perfect world, I mean, is there an angle for -- I mean I know you've just said that you're not going to change the mainframe, and there's no need to change the mainframe, but if...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Didn't say I wasn't going to change it. I said I wasn't going to basically have a wholesale replacement of our core banking system, which is clearly not what we're going to do. But as soon as you stop developing any aspects of your infrastructure, it starts to potentially atrophy. So you need to continue to manage all of these elements so they stay.</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA: Maybe rephrase it. Once you've -- you're cleaning up all the layers and simplifying as you've said it, at 1 point, maybe the layers are clean enough that you can...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: I might go to your first question actually because I think any thought that we're going to get to the end of the race and it's done and draw a line under it is just not credible, right? If you look at where we started, which was the percentage of our total technology spend 100 years ago was 0, okay? It's on an inevitable trajectory, right? The number of the people in this organization, a percentage of the overall expense, which is the other major cost, is reducing. Property, which is the other major cost, is reducing. So the percentage of the overall expense of the organization from a technology perspective is, in my mind, only going to increase, right? It's the nature of the evolution of the business.</p><p>Now what we're showing is the run costs, as we increase that capability, actually reducing. So that's the other characteristic you see of some of these emerging companies. Potentially, 90% of what they spend is on going somewhere new, and 10% is actually staying where they are. We've come to a position where 90% of what we're doing was staying where were and 10% was actually going somewhere new. So what we're showing you here is actually the changing dynamics of actually moving our spend from an increasing proportion actually being in going somewhere new as opposed to standing still. But that's the choice. At the end of the day, we could improve our cost-to-income ratio pretty dramatically by taking GBP 1 billion out of the cost tomorrow, yes? Be a pretty stupid thing to do. We could call it's the end of the day. Race is over. We're done, yes, it will obviously dramatically improve the financial performance in short term. By the way, that sounds like an outrageous thing to say, but I wouldn't actually think that you haven't seen some organizations out there in the past that have absolutely starved the investment to drive a financial performance in the short term that's come home to roost.</p><p>So in terms of the characterization of the costs and so on, they're going to continue to -- I think we're going to get more efficiency out of the technology. We're going to get better -- the cloud, for example, provides a real opportunity there, and it's already doing that for us.</p><p>The reason we went to a set of capabilities that we bought together, mashed up, for want of a better term, to create B\u00c3\u00b3 is because we wanted to bring those capabilities together. In short order, we can do that. It's how we're spinning up new capabilities in the organization. And I could do that with the mainframe for some time, but that's not actually where those tools that we wanted to put together were existing. [Preview], for example, which is one of the tools we're using, we're going to use for the whole bank. I don't need to put it on the mainframe. It won't be on the mainframe.</p><p>But as the books and records of 19 million customers, it does a bloody good job, right? The throughput, the payments, we don't miss a beat, right? And that's the challenge that you're seeing with some of those that are learning their lesson as they go, right? It's not inherent in these new environments that they have the resilience, the stability, yes, or actually the ability to manage those, and you're seeing that in terms of the availability of some of those services over time, right? So you're going to see an evolution of all the participants, those that are growing and acquiring new capabilities. Hopefully, they don't build a 5,500 application solution that basically 1 day somebody says, how do we end up here, right, because that's the opportunity loss. But it's a feasible outcome.</p><p>I ran this little software company once by the way. We started off and we did derivative software. We did interest rate derivatives and then we said what are we going to do next. We said, well, let's do equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, do the FX derivatives. Somebody said let's do the hedge. You build this thing out over time, and before you knew it, you actually had something that had a level of complexity that was far greater than where we started. We sort of curated that reasonably well, but that shows you the risk.</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA: Just to follow on from there. Some banks -- some of your competitors are saying that if the revenue environment sort of obviously softened, which given the flat curve is very possible or likely, they would sort of pull back or slow down investment. Are you -- is it -- as you're saying, that won't be a smart thing to do? Or you can't afford to do it given the competitive changes? Or you weren't being that explicit. How would you manage...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: I will take the question in terms of detail and then, Christine, you might want to talk to more of what our plans are. But I think what I've tried to give is the sense or the basis on which we're thinking this through and actually the sort of the general direction, right? Clearly, you have to look at the climate, and you have to look at the opportunity. I mean it's interesting, the -- there are a lot of organizations spending a lot of money that yield very little return out there. At present moment in time what I've tried to demonstrate today is actually we've spent that money. We've actually got a return on each of those investments, whether it be around the stuff that was actually transforming our traditional capabilities or actually the funnel that we've created that brings new capabilities in the organization to have a number of potentially at-scale solutions, and that's not a bad outcome. But I think you cut your cloth to the competitive environment that you're in and your goals and objectives, we're trying to get a return here of over 12% at the end of the day of what we do in the whole. So these are drivers of our decision-making. Does that make sense?</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON: So I think in terms -- you're spot on in the GBP 1.6 billion is our combined technology number, but obviously, GBP 0.9 million, our run cost is the only bet that is set in stone. In terms of our go-forward investments, I think that Simon will be disappointed, but the number may come down a little but come down a little because the mandatory work we are significantly through that journey.</p><p>In terms of discretionary and innovation, we have a budget process where we look to see combined with whether we've got gaps in our strategy, we will have the 12% return that Simon's mentioned hedges the payback period work and our overall affordability. So I don't think we've got a direction of travel, but we'll make that assessment in terms of what the opportunities are. I think a big advantage that we've got if we do to say to sort of soften some of our spend because we haven't got a large chunk on the balance sheet, we then would see the benefit of it. And that's certainly not intent at the moment.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Thanks. Can we just go to the back there, this one?</p><p>JOHN CRONIN, FINANCIALS ANALYST, GOODBODY STOCKBROKERS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's John Cronin from Goodbody. I just wanted to come back again to the core platform and to just understand a little better this modular approach. So I guess are there potential risks attached to continuing to add modules as it were just like, for example, drawing parallels between that new schematic and your old systems, which were maybe put together after -- and bundled together after following various acquisitions? Are there limitations in terms of how far it can grow? Could it slow you down? Could it require maybe one-off substantive spend in the future that we're not seeing today? I'm just trying to understand the risks better around that.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: No, fair enough.</p><p>JOHN CRONIN: I guess -- sorry.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Yes. No, I mean I talked to that. I mean what we see is something that is working for us well today and something that we're maintaining at a good level. Now as I said, there are some opportunities that we've put some money aside to transform some aspects of our core. So what I want to do on the pricing side is effectively the extraction of that capability not just from our existing core system but actually across the estate as a whole. So it's about the engineering of the totality. You don't look at this core, as we call it, in isolation.</p><p>I would expose through, I think, 57 APIs access to this core. That makes it as agile as anything else on it. I mean it's -- and I could also ultimately change the underlying. That's the beauty of the way that this is structured. It's a much more architected solution. So I can then start to change some of the underlying without having to worry about the fact that it's connected to all these other pieces. So now there is a danger in -- it's not modularization for modularization's stake. It's just basically shaping the totality of our platform in a way that is more resilient, more agile.</p><p>So for example, we're investing in our debit card capability at the moment. We don't think it's strong enough for where we want to be. Now I can do that without having to change every aspect of my core platform. It's a key focus for us, and we think we can build something that goes on beyond that so there's -- but that's the opportunity.</p><p>So it's not as if this core is untouchable as if we've got this thing, it's locked in concrete. It's actually -- it's the evolution of it over time. And I come back to the point I was making earlier. Those that I've seen undertake these massive core investments have changed many things that actually didn't need to be changed and in many cases, actually never delivered on that core replacement. And because of the quantum of investment that's available, they didn't get to other aspects of the estate. So I was speaking to one bank recently. They're essentially now trying to fix up a lot of things that I've had to fix up here for lack of investment. What happened here, just to be clear, is that we had a functioning set of technology that then we underinvested in and we extended, and so every penny went into the extension of the business model, so went into -- that'd be true of what we do with the property portfolio as well, right?</p><p>And in the process, you'd underinvested, sorry, in the -- not just the core but every aspects of our estate that was really looking after those 19 million customers. And so that's what's happened in some other organizations where they have basically got so focused on an element of the core that other aspects of that are now decaying around that. And they're seeing real problems in terms of the availability of those services or actually a big catch-up cost to actually go and address the rest of the estate because they got somewhat obsessed with the core.</p><p>JOHN CRONIN: Great. And so look, it's very clear that you didn't raise any money there in terms of the approach that you've adopted. But would it be fair to say that on that basis, fair for me to conclude that you're not any less agile than you would be where you -- had you invested in a -- had you gone down the Temenos route, which is obviously one of the...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: No. I mean no, no. I mean we actually have a version of that here to support our private banking business because that was the platform they chose to work on. I'm also looking at using some of our core capabilities to support some of these new services that Kevin highlighted earlier. So it shows you how future looking some of these pieces are in that they can service some of these new applications. But it's not a sort of -- so these are sort of sweeping statements. We have to be careful with them, but actually the most important thing is how you curate the portfolio, the engine. I think you understand what the collective achieves. And then actually you maximize the return where you actually ultimately focus your resources. That makes sense?</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: We were talking to the Board the other day and just tolerate one more food analogy. Simon used chicken Kievs earlier. I'm going to try one because we were talking to the Board about the architectural journey that we've been on. And we're describing in effect how we've gone from the spaghetti that Simon was describing earlier and the analogy with spaghetti to lasagna to ravioli for the nonarchitectural people in the room is literally the description of the way that the architecture has evolved through time. So historically, it was a spaghetti of things that were hard to unpick that got lumped together. Then you put in place the architectural layers that let you kind of decompose that, is the lasagna step. And you now move to a world that's much closer to the ravioli piece, which is the componentized modular ability. I mean the phrase that we use internally is reduce reliance on the core as opposed to the replacement of the core. So you strip functionality from the core. You strip bundles of functionality out to specifically derisk the risk that you have over a singular plate of spaghetti. You take your bundles of functionality out in such a way that you can then take those bundles of functionality or ravioli and then share them both internally and externally in a much more adaptive, agile way. So the journey is to do that as quickly and as smoothly as possible in a much more derisked way, then somebody say, \"You know what, we're going to bet the farm. I'm taking this plate of spaghetti and investing GBP 5 billion over 5 years to kind of turn this thing off and turn something else on.\" Actually, you think is a much smarter, much more derisked way of achieving the same outcome, I think, if not, a better outcome of a lower risk, more adaptive, more agile, more configurable, more plug-and-play type environment, was the nontechnical description to the Board the other day of kind of what we're trying to do.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: When did the chicken Kiev come into it?</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: I know you mentioned chicken Kievs earlier. I don't know. It was all about food.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Might go to closest, most proximate. Sorry, I thought I was curating it, but no.</p><p>ROHITH CHANDRA-RAJAN, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry. So Rohith Chandra-Rajan, Bank of America. Just wondering if I could ask you from a revenue perspective. To what degree do you think sort of the new products and capabilities that you're pushing out are what is required to just retain that 19 million customer base and potentially offset some of the, I guess, revenue erosion that we might be seeing elsewhere? And how much is the development of new revenue streams either because you're doing more with the existing customer base, tie ups with MoneySuperMarket, et cetera, that you'd talked about? And how much is new customer acquisition? If you've got any sense of how sort of the work that you're doing might split.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: It's all of the above, isn't it? So I think, firstly, clearly, some aspects of what we're doing are defensive. That's in terms of enriching our current tool set. I like the fact that we've used the APIs to build 5 services now that build upon Mimo being one, the aggregation of accounts across customers. By the way, that's the only one that's embedded within a mobile app. The others are standalone, and that's what we're doing, which is the customer seemed to like. So I think there's that defensive piece.</p><p>I think we're scratching the surface in terms of the revenue upside. So we're starting to get some stuff out there. I think we have had -- and I think as we release more effort from the mandatory portfolio into the more discretionary it'll give us more opportunity in that regard. But I think we're going to learn as we go, but I wouldn't want to quantify that, but certainly, that's where we're focused.</p><p>And then there's the opening up new segments as such, so not just new revenue streams around the existing customer base but going to the new. And I think we have enough plays in that space. They may not all succeed or maybe none of them succeed, but we certainly got, as I said earlier, a dog in the race or whatever the phrase I used. But I think we are participating in each of those spaces with a potential that then presents. And there's nothing to say that we shouldn't have -- I do come back to that point earlier. We're less distracted by the means that are necessary to establish a new capability, I think, than some others. I think we have had a level of distraction as we try to fix things up. But now actually, we make decisions very quickly, and we have the resources to be able to fuel where we see that opportunity. So I would anticipate more of a play into the revenue enhancement space, whether that be the acquisition of new customers or the enhancement of capabilities for existing customers. And I mentioned a couple of them earlier.</p><p>ROHITH CHANDRA-RAJAN: And how is something like Mimo changing customer behavior?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: I -- so I think the very important thing for me is that what I'm seeing in the engagement is a bit like Kevin said earlier with the Liverpool branch when we put this chat service out there with the avatar. The reaction we got from our so-called more vulnerable customers, but those are the older customers who actually are very positive one because they felt that it was there for them, and that wasn't what we'd anticipated, I think that's what I see with Mimo as you talk to the customers. There's nothing that brings the home more than watching a customer sitting in bed because we've been video diary-ing some of these people at 3:00 in the morning, stressed with the fact that their credit card bill is due the next day and they haven't actually sorted out their car insurance. If I could just say actually, by the way, we'll take care of that for you if you'd like. And by the way, if you don't like, you can do that yourself. Watching the customer's reaction to that, I think we've underestimated the amount of stress and strain that we'd put into the financial lives of our customers by not providing the level of support. We've looked to the products historically, and we've tried to find products that really provide a service for the customer, but actually it's that service around it and support for that, that I think we're seeing real resonance with the customers. So I think there's massive potential there in terms of empathy shown through the technology and the services for the customer in very challenging circumstance. And sometimes we underestimate actually how powerful and impactful those.</p><p>Who's in charge of the mic? I thought I was and then it had -- it was bested out of my hand.</p><p>JENNIFER ALEXANDRA COOK, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jenny Cook, Exane. Coming back to your earlier analogy on open banking and restaurants and waiters, if I think back to a stint I had a few years ago as a waitress, hopefully, I did help the customer, but at the same time, I'm pretty sure I added quite a few costs to their bill, so training cost, ongoing cost, cover served, service charge, hopefully a tip. What cost do you think open banking has kind of added to your ongoing operation, particularly around fraud and security?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: That's a very good point. I think -- firstly, I think as it was launched, there wasn't sufficient thought for the security aspects, and we were big callers out of the fact that more thought should go. And I think this has come back to the regulatory agenda more broadly, which is often there's an intent to do something, but as you're thinking through, the full consequence isn't always there. And I think what was said I think by Carney in the last week just in terms of an ability to walk us straight some of that more effectively is a good thing, right?</p><p>So then come back to the most important principle when we do any of these new things is that we don't try and defy gravity, and we come back to the underlying need. So I come back to it better be secure. It better be resilient, yes? And therefore, our lens to everything we do has that. And we've got a bunch of experience in that, right? So I think -- which means that we're not on a sort of a folly. Now there's a cost in that, but actually, there's a benefit. There's definitely a peace dividend in here. The fact that I'm not and Ross isn't and this organization is not debilitated by the fact that things are falling about our ears every day allows us to focus on, and we better do a decent job with it, but actually releases us to do other things. So these things that were perceived often as a cost in the overhead turnout actually in the aggregate in my mind and experience to actually be not neutral but positive in terms of the overall performance of the organization.</p><p>Now there is an overhead in some of these APIs in the fact that you have to construct something that is more robust, better engineered than a point-to-point connection. I still, with a point-to-point connection, have to think about the security. I don't just sort of knock it together and hope for the best. But if I'm building an API and I'm building micro services, the principle there is ultimately the fact they're going to be reused and also the fact that, as I change either end of that, I don't have to change the whole chain. I just have to talk to the waiter and basically, the kitchen -- you could change the entire kitchen, but the waiters actually taken that concern away for me or the other way around. There's a different set of customers each day, and I don't have to worry about a different set of customers. I have to worry that the waiters basically manage a different set of customers and then bringing to me their distilled needs. So you have to get reusability through these because if it was 1 customer, 1 waiter, 1 chef, that's why you often end up in these little restaurants with 1 chef talking to the customer, and a little place in Scotland I go to, right, because actually it's only got 2 or 3 customers.</p><p>So the point being actually you need reusability through that and you need value through those APIs through time. And therefore, there is some upfront and initial investment to make sure they're fit for purpose. But actually, it will pay back over time. The false economy historically is the mess that we created as an industry, not through the application of these techniques. By the way, we didn't have some of the techno -- technical capabilities we have today to make it easier to do that. But when I went and studied computer science in 1942, right, we were taught to basically modularize to basically to abstract the complexity embedded within and have simple interfaces between pieces, right? That's actually the basis in which we were all educated. We then all went to work and then created these things that weren't architected in the same way. So there's that sort of -- I mean it's a very long-winded answer to your question. But essentially, yes, it does provide some overhead, but I think you get that back in multiples properly architected than what we use.</p><p>KEVIN HANLEY: The one thing, I think, will happen is I think it's guaranteed the organizations such as ours than anyone else is actually will evolve through time to recognize the strategic importance of APIs, and sort of what we now describe as open banking I think becomes a much more strategic, significant kind of discussion moving forward. So I think you see the evolution of both the discussion.</p><p>Think at the moment that the discussion is overly technically oriented both within the organization and our people. Think about -- I think you said I think the organization evolves from standing up a technical capability. There's some -- there is a line function -- there's a function within the organization that needs to be stood up technically to do that, but the real evolution of the conversation that we're having is suddenly -- I think people will speak less about technical capability and more about -- to mix analogies, if I've got a set of LEGO bricks and you've got a set of LEGO bricks and we both conclude that the answer lies in combining both of those to do new and unique and insightful things that no one else has built before, then the strategic overlay on how do you do that, how do you do -- how do you take those LEGO bricks and combine them? What are the APIs that you need to stand up to support that? How do you prioritize? What order do you do those things? And all of that I think becomes massively powerful for organizations moving forward and is a much more strategic significance. I don't think it's an overhead, but I think people may have underestimated the strategic significance of the conversation that's being had. So I think you see the elevation of something that's a technical conversation at the moment to a much more thoughtful conversation moving forward.</p><p>JENNIFER ALEXANDRA COOK: Secondly, just looking at the expectation for ongoing technology run costs to you come down. Just wanted to understand the nature of that a little bit. So if I look at Slide 9, I can see that you're expecting, say, about a 15% reduction in technology applications from 2020 into 2021. And a lot of that looks to be coming from the traditional infrastructure. My understanding of those kind of applications is often they're quite data processing heavy, a lot of physical presence. Are you looking to kind of reduce your physical data processing and storage in line with that? And how much of this is coming from those physical reductions versus cheaper applications to actually be able to run?</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON: Yes. Something you're -- that's definitely our direction of travel. We are looking -- we continually reduce them in off, on-premise data. That's far more expensive than cloud. And that's a journey that we will continue on to the point that we'll actually reduce the number of data centers from where we are now. And I think again just simplifying our general portfolio in terms of applications, replacing old, expensive ways of doing activity with future cloud more variable where we get the benefit of less maintenance, data utilization, that's the direction we will travel. I did mention earlier, I think as we continue to invest and as the shape of how we do business changes, we probably will see our technology cost taper off slightly in terms of reduction, but we still expect them to come down.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Go here and then here, and then we're going to have to wrap up (inaudible).</p><p>AMANDEEP SINGH RAKKAR, EUROPEAN BANKS ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Cool. It's Aman Rakkar from Barclays. I was just interested in how much of an interest the regulator takes in your kind of investment agenda over the next 3 years and kind of getting that balance right between obviously very significant cost saves on a net asset each year with basically enough investment in perhaps the resilience of your firm. And I'm particularly also interested in Bank of England is going to be testing banks on cyberattack as part of the stress testing process. I'm not sure if we're going to actually see the results of that in terms of being publicly disclosed. But I mean I'll be interested how do you think a bank could react to a failure of that part of the stress test. Do you think the Bank of England perhaps could ask somebody to increase their investment spend with regards to resilience?</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Look, I'm sure they could. Look, they're -- we work very closely with the supervisory teams, and so they're very familiar with our plans. We ran a big program here at least not long after I arrived -- actually, it was started before I arrived but actually was to remedy some of the challenges under Section 166, so they had pretty clear visibility to that. We chose to sort of build upon that as a sort of foundation to keep that sort of -- that communication channel going. Obviously, what we're doing in the cloud space, they're intimately involved with and we -- with any material outsourcing, we have to notify the regulator. They don't decide whether we do it or not, but they certainly ask a lot of questions to test where we are.</p><p>The one thing I would say is that feedback generally from the regulators is a positive one in terms of their view of where we are. I mean the feedback around the open banking APIs, as you heard, is actually very strong, right? So I think we put a lot of store in the relationship with the regulators and the informing of the regulators and then keeping them up to speed, at the same time take their counsel. They obviously have a concern in the aggregate of taking cost down and seeing resilience fail. There's a lot of pressure politically in that space as well.</p><p>The last thing I'll say is we do get intimately involved in the establishment of some of these tests. I think cybersecurity team, for example, here is very much engaged in determination of what a good test might look like in conjunction with Bank of England. So -- and I'm not sure where the results go ultimately in terms of that. I probably should do, but I don't. All I know is we see them. And I would be very disappointed if we didn't perform well in that with the investments we've made. We've come a long way, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the cyberspace.</p><p>To your last point, there's a significant risk here, right? You're seeing the -- what -- when you go to what I mentioned earlier in terms of different industries where there's been exposure of data and where they've been compromised, right, I think one of the advantages that we do have is the fact that we've always been trying to protect the assets of our customers in a way that meant the core of this, we didn't need people basically making payments unauthorized, and we need to secure that information and data. I think that's crept up on other industries, and I'm not sitting here resting on our laurels. Far from it. But I do think it's made us very aware of the risks in a way that they weren't the sort of exposures that some other industries had, and they've discovered that through the cyberspace. So it's an ongoing need for investment.</p><p>The one thing they would say about us is that we start our whole investment process by saying what do we need to do before what we would like to do, right? And I think that's actually a very healthy approach to take, and that's one that I know the regulators have had full visibility to and would -- yes, which takes away some of the angst because if you start from the other end of the lens and you just constrain to whatever you have less for the things you need to do, then you end up in a mess.</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON: I mean obviously, as we make the final decision as our balanced approach is not purely financial return, we have different people playing different elements in terms of evaluating the portfolio, whether that be a risk community or whether it be ultimately negates to Board.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: All right. What's the appetite for the rest of the room for keeping going on with these questions? Because...</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON: Trying. Chap's been trying for some time.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Right. You get a go if it was a short one if you don't mind.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CANT, PARTNER, UNITED KINGDOM AND IRISH BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: It will be a short one. It's Chris Cant from Autonomous. One on B\u00c3\u00b3 and one on CapEx. So B\u00c3\u00b3, is the long-term goal with something like B\u00c3\u00b3 to ultimately potentially migrate the rest of the NatWest franchise across? I mean is it -- is that something you can see happening potentially down the line where a NatWest customer gets an app update and clicks, yes, I agree and transfers across to B\u00c3\u00b3 and it enables you to...</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: So wanted to take that question quickly because I think there could be an outcome, yes? I wouldn't say that it's not going to be an outcome, but it's not necessarily as an outcome either, right? So I think we give ourselves optionality in that space. Having said that, there are many services that we provide today that B\u00c3\u00b3 is a million miles away from providing around those core accounts, right, so as an element of that. So I can certainly see it as a complementary capability for others services we provide. There's no reason why we shouldn't and others do that already if that makes sense.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CANT: Sure. Then the final one on CapEx. Just thinking about your suite of projects over the last few years. Obviously, quite a lot of the investment has been going into resilience, and I appreciate how, when you look at that on an NPV basis, satisfying the regulatory probably doesn't have a sell-in spreadsheet necessarily to make the NPV the right level. But should we expect your CapEx rate to pick up from here? I mean to the extent you expect to be generating more revenue positive opportunities in terms of your investment program, presumably within your investment spend in aggregate, we should see more of that move into CapEx, and that would come through as lower costs on the P&amp;L.</p><p>CHRISTINE MCPHERSON: I think the counter going the other way is a reduction, hopefully, in reg spend. Reg spend by its nature at the moment is eligible for capitalization. So I think as that comes down, the sort of general mix in terms of what [hex] the criteria, it may balance out. It may tip up slightly. We're also just working through, as we move to cloud, how does that affect, what type of technology we can and can't capitalize. I don't think it will change our statistics majorly but may move it 5%. But I don't see it making a material impact.</p><p>SIMON MCNAMARA: Look, thanks very much for your time, everyone. Really appreciate. I mean that's 2 hours in a, what's a bit of a soar up the frontier. So hopefully, you came away from this understanding that we do have a platform that does have some characteristics, some very positive characteristics. It's resilient. We have an ability of agility that maybe some of you hadn't seen. So very happy to continue the conversation outside. So we'll go outside into the room with some tea, some coffee and so on. We'll be there for about an hour or something, so you get a chance. Then any time after, to be perfectly honest, we're quite open to get on the matter, whatever it is if there's something that we can pick up on, right? But thanks very much for your time, everyone. Cheers. Appreciate it.

It is also the first piece of work to explore these ethical questions in depth and propose actions to ensure they deliver on their potential.</p><p>Neural interfaces are devices implanted in the body, or worn externally, which are capable of recording or stimulating activity in the brain and peripheral nervous system.</p><p>This offers a new frontier for treating conditions like dementia, paralysis, mental health conditions or obesity. While recent announcements from 'Big Tech' firms and entrepreneurs have shown their potential to change how we communicate, and interact with technology.</p><p>As a result, the report's expert steering group says ministers should act swiftly to understand the ethical risks and ensure regulations are fit to make the UK a global leader in the field.</p><p>\"The applications for neural interfaces are as unimaginable today as the smartphone was a few decades ago,\" said report co-chair Christofer Toumazou FRS FREng FMedSci, Regius Professor of Engineering and Chair in Biomedical Circuit Design, Imperial College London.</p><p>\"They could bring huge economic benefits to the UK and transform sectors like the NHS, public health and social care, but if developments are dictated by a handful of companies then less commercial applications could be side-lined.</p><p>\"That is why we are calling on the government to launch a national investigation into this emerging field, to identify the UK's priorities and let the public help shape how the technology develops and where we want it to take us.\"</p><p>Dr Tim Constandinou, Director of the Next Generation Neural Interfaces (NGNI) Lab, Imperial College London and co-chair of the report, said: \"By 2040 neural interfaces are likely to be an established option to enable people to walk after paralysis and tackle treatment-resistant depression, they may even have made treating Alzheimer's disease a reality.</p><p>\"While advances like seamless brain-to-computer communication seem a much more distant possibility, we should act now to ensure our ethical and regulatory safeguards are flexible enough for any future development.</p><p>\"In this way we can guarantee these emerging technologies are implemented safely and for the benefit of humanity.\"</p><p>Harnessing the possibilities from neural interfaces</p><p>The UK has a proven track record in promoting rapid and responsible implementation of innovative new technologies, such as mitochondrial replacement therapy and pre-implantation genetic testing.</p><p>Combined with the NHS, a dynamic life sciences sector and thriving creative industries - in particular gaming - the UK is perfectly positioned to identify and implement new applications for neural interfaces.</p><p>The Royal Society is proposing the government use this emerging field as a test case for a new regulatory approach, which could accelerate development of innovative technology in the future.</p><p>It is recommending:</p><p>A 'national investigation' of the ethical issues presented by neural interfaces, to address questions of what data should be collected, how it is kept safe, and the acceptability of enhancements.</p><p>Ministers work with industry and universities to create a UK Neural Interface Ecosystem which encourages innovation and collaboration in this field.</p><p>Government and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) should trial new ways of encouraging innovation to prevent a monopoly by \"Big Tech\" firms. This could include a \"sandbox\" approach for new medical devices to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in a controlled environment.</p><p>Giving the public a clear voice in shaping how this technology is used and regulated for the public good and opting citizens out of having their neural data shared as a default.</p><p>A public dialogue exercise led by the Royal Society found strong support for neural interfaces in situations where they enable patients to recover something that has been lost due to injury or a medical condition; but less support for the technology when it is used to enhance functions such as memory, concentration or physical skills among healthy people.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>External and internal neural interfaces are already being used in medical conditions from stroke rehabilitation to epilepsy and commercial products promising better appetite control, or improved sleep and focus are already a reality.</p><p>There are no internally-implanted interfaces licensed outside of medicine, but this may only be a matter of time.</p><p>In July, tech mogul Elon Musk announced that as early as 2020 his company, Neuralink, could apply to start human trials in the US using ultrafine electrodes inserted in the brain to allow people with locked-in syndrome or paralysis to control a computer or phone.</p><p>While Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg has expressed interest in \"telepathic typing\" and the company is supporting research that aims to create an external headset able to transcribe a vocabulary of 1,000 words, at a rate of 100-words per minute, just by thinking.</p><p>The Royal Society expert working group says there is a possibility that, in future, \"people could become telepathic to some degree\" as more sophisticated neural interfaces emerge.</p><p>However, the most advanced attempts to send thoughts to date are at the level of AI recognising simple brain patterns which correspond to pre-trained words or answers.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6847513 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6847513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-B431-DYG2-R55G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>7:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I  am not okay. After reading that article in The Post, it was deeply  disturbing, troubling, and painful for me to read.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Rose apologizes for inappropriate behavior, but how did his  misconduct stay secret for so long? This as The New York Times suspends  star White House correspondent Glenn Thrush over harassment allegations.  And as Roy Moore accuser Leigh Corfman goes on NBC, President Trump defends  the embattled Alabama senate candidate and is denounced by many of the  pundits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEIGH CORFMAN, ROY MOORE ACCUSER: He basically laid out some blankets on  the floor of his living room and proceeded to seduce me. I guess you would  say. And during the course of that, he removed my clothing.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me just tell you, Roy  Moore denies it. And by the way, he totally denies it.</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, HOST, ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES: The president of the United  States effectively endorsed an accused child molester for U.S. Senate. I'm  just going to repeat that to let it sink in.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, JOURNALIST, FOX NEWS: The lesson if you listen to what the  president said is, if you deny the allegations, you get the benefit of the  doubt in politics. That is a strange --</p><p>JOHN HEILEMANN, JOURNALIST, NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: Donald trump didn't seem to  find problem to be on the side of neo-Nazis and apparently he doesn't see a  problem being on the side of the accused child predators either.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump obviously taking a pragmatic approach to  the Alabama senate race. A Republican victory would at least ensure the  senate GOP would preserve its majority by the its current margin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: What is behind this tsunami of criticism for the president? This as  three more women accused Al Franken of probing them. He keeps on  apologizing. And Congressman John Conyers admits settling a former staffer  suit that included claims of sexual harassment. Is the press covering these  cases fairly?</p><p>Plus, Trump getting into Twitter words with NFL protester Marshawn Lynch  and the father of UCLA basketball player the president got sprung from  Chinese custody. The pundits scorecard says he's picking the wrong fights,  but is that true? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"</p><p>After President Trump's initial statement that Roy Moore should get out of  the Alabama senate race if the sexual misconduct allegations against him  are true, he suddenly seems to shift his stance. That was after Leigh  Corfman, who first told The Washington Post that Moore sexually accosted  her when she was 14 appeared on \"The Today Show\" and explain why she did  not speak out when Moore first got into politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORFMAN: My children were small. I was a single parent. And when you're in  that situation, you do everything you can to protect your own. So when The  Washington Post sought me out, I didn't come looking for this. This fell in  my lap.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: When the president took questions from reporters, he made clear he  wanted the former judge in the senate over Democrat Doug Jones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is an accused child molester better than a Democrat?  It is an accused child molester better than a Democrat?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, he denies it. He denies it. I mean, if you look at what is  really going on and you look at all the things that have happened over the  last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it did not happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: And the New York tabloids reacting with these headlines. Striking  the same theme. Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Ellison Barber, Fox  News correspondent here in Washington; Gayle Trotter, political commentator  who contributes to The Daily Caller and The Hill; and Juan Williams, co- host of The Five.</p><p>Ellison, President Trump's comments as we just saw causing a huge media  uproar, because he was seen as essentially endorsing Roy Moore in the  Alabama race. Has the White House pushed back on that?</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: It's a non-endorsement  endorsement. Initially you had the White House saying, as we heard earlier,  saying that if these allegations are true, he should step down. And they  repeatedly said that President Trump wants the voters of Alabama to decide.  He had noticeably not said anything about it until those comments on the  south lawn.</p><p>Then yo had the comments on the south lawn. Then you had him tweet again  today that it's better than a Pelosi or Schumer puppet. So, I mean, there  is only so much they can push back at some point. The White House can say  as much as they want that he wants the voters of Alabama to decide,  whatever, that if he thinks the allegations are true, then he should step  down.</p><p>I believe they have also said that he considered the allegations troubling.  It doesn't really matter when President Trump comes out and then says what  he has said. I think we have to take his words more than anything from the  press secretary.</p><p>KURTZ: Gale, much of the media are portraying this is a dramatic shift for  President Trump. And they say, well, if he is essentially siding with Roy  Moore or attacking a Democrat which is kind of the same thing, that shows  he doesn't care about these sexual harassment allegations. Is that a lift  (ph) the president making?</p><p>GAYLE TROTTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That is a lift (ph). And just think  about what you said, his previous position was that if the allegations were  true, he should step down. And then when he spoke to the press this week,  he said that he totally denied it. Forty years was a long time ago. There  have been multiple races where this hasn't come up.</p><p>So I would say he has changed his position. And when asked by the media  specifically was he going to go down to Alabama and campaign for Roy Moore,  he said I will decide next week. So, saying that he has taken a different  position is an unfair characterization and saying that he is endorsing Roy  Moore is inconsistent as well with the facts.</p><p>KURTZ: The press does not seem to be buying that argument. They are saying  that in effect and this is not everybody in journalism, but many say that  in effect, if he is saying the Democrat is terrible and you got to listen  to Roy Moore's denials, he is kind of sending a signal. So is there a leak  (INAUDIBLE) question I asked Gayle?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, THE FIVE: No, I think you have to put it in the  political context, Howie, and the political context is this. Remember,  President Trump did not back Judge Moore in the republican primary in the  state of Alabama.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He picked the incumbent, the appointee Luther Strange. So, what  you get is a situation where then once Roy Moore won the seat, there was  pressure on him, I think he felt somewhat, you know, hey maybe I made the  wrong call earlier. My base is with Judge Moore. The (INAUDIBLE) community  is strong there.</p><p>KURTZ: Is the press reading him right? Is the press --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think they're right.</p><p>KURTZ: -- interpreting what he is doing here with --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I do not think there is any question that Steve Bannon who has  been involved in this and is part of the push in the press by the way at  Breitbart, to get people to look at Roy Moore differently has also  influenced President Trump.</p><p>So, while it may be fear (ph), as Gayle points out, I have to say, well, he  really hasn't changed. I think the statement that he made going out to the  helicopter before the Thanksgiving holiday was far more aggressive and  public in terms of support for Moore than anything that he had done before.</p><p>BARBER: I think part of the context too is President Trump did not speak  about it until the south lawn. So in terms of did he change is a matter of  he said this, his press team said this.</p><p>KURTZ: Many of these politicians try to avoid the media allegations. So for  example, Roy Moore, the initial radio conversation with Sean Hannity, has  not talked to a journalist. Now he may be can do that, of course he got  twice as many accusers now as in the beginning,  but the president is  constantly in photo ops and opportunities, he ultimately does not have that  option, does he? Just saying nothing?</p><p>BARBER: Not necessarily. Sometimes, you see instances where reporters shout  questions and he keeps walking by, so he can certainly strategically avoid  them if he wants or not answer. I do think whether people love or hate  President Trump, I think the most thing that everyone agrees on is that he  usually does not, I don't think, usually ignore a whole lot of questions.</p><p>I think when the questions are thrown at him sometimes, I think his press  office would wish that he doesn't. I think he usually answers or responds  with Twitter or whatever. He usually is better about responding. That is  why it was particularly notable initially and why so many people talked  about ho he hadn't commented on Roy Moore.</p><p>KURTZ: He engages with reporters a lot more than he used to. More than most  presidents, I must say. Now, you've seen stories, segments trying to  resurrect the harassment allegations against Donald Trump himself. About a  dozen women who made these allegations at the end of the campaign last  year. He has called them horrible liars. Is it fair or unfair for the media  now to revive that issue?</p><p>TROTTER: Certainly relevant for the media to bring that up, because it is  historically interesting and it gives color to the story, and it certainly  gives an insight into what President Trump is thinking. And if he truly  believes that these women were liars, then that could show why he would be  more likely to support Roy Moore and think that there should be a  presumption of innocence.</p><p>And like Juan was saying, I was a little surprised that he did not come out  and say, well, I was right, I supported the challenger to Roy Moore. And  like Ellison was saying, there is no filter on him and so he has the  ability to go out there and say that. It is a little surprising that he  didn't say, hey, I was right, you should have listened to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think what surprised me too to pick up on this point is, that  he then opened the door to the media criticism of his past and going back.  Now the argument would be that voters are different than a private  employer. You mentioned some cases at the top of the show, Charlie Rose,  Glenn Thrush and others. These are people who are in the public eye, but  they really work for a private enterprise, a media organization.</p><p>KURTZ: There is no verdict by the voters.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Correct. But here with President Trump, there was a verdict by  the voters. And some people say, well, does that mean that they were judge  and jury with regard to the sexual harassment claims? Or did they prefer  him as president? I don't know if they were truly judge and jury, but I  think lots of people in President Trump's camp say, that issue is dead  because the voters --</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, I don't say that, some people misinterpreted what I said on the  show last week, just noting that there was an election at these  allegations. Ivanka Trump certainly has said she believes the women  involved. The president is taking a different stance. And I guess, you  know, that does lead lots of questions of why these women accused you.</p><p>You say that they are not telling the truth and maybe he is skeptical of  Roy Moore. Let me go a little more here because the spotlight now is  shifting to the Democrats. If I can just go through, three more accusers  since last week saying that Senator Al Franken grabbed them. But in photo  ap, one picture of one woman, at least we can put that up, Linsay Menz. He  has apologized again. He said he crossed line. And senator is going to talk  to Minnesota reporters later today.</p><p>Eighty-eight-year-old John Conyers, Democrat, dean of the House actually,  first reported by BuzzFeed that he secretly used $27,000 taxpayers money to  settle a former staffer suite that included allegations of sexual  harassment. He denies it. In terms of media coverage, is this all becoming  a blur? Is it muddying the waters about who did what?</p><p>BARBER: I do not know if I would say a blur. I guess it depends on how you  think of blurt? I think in terms of just the amount of information that is  being thrown at a reader, maybe there is a lot to process and digest. I  feel like everyday, I am trying to keep up with it.</p><p>KURTZ: Right, and we do this for a living.</p><p>BARBER: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: But also, are there important distinctions to be made about the  level of conduct or harassment compared to people who have been accused of  sexual assault or rape?</p><p>BARBER: Yes, absolutely. I think the difference can be seen usually in the  reporting. I think that is the reporters job, is to accurately portray sort  of where this falls and whether it is child molester, rape accusation or  something else, but that doesn't mean it should be covered simply because  there are other major --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Let me just say. Another distinction to be made, in the  Conyers case, the allegation -- I think it is more of an allegation now.  You could correct me if I'm wrong. He used taxpayer dollars --</p><p>KURTZ: No, that's a fact.</p><p>WILLIAMS: that is office funds to buy off or silence --</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- this woman.</p><p>KURTZ: This was just a couple of years ago and it was done in secret.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. That is the case, that is different than what we are  talking about. Other cases, I do not know about settlements, but the idea  that you're using public funds, if that is not an exception, not common  practice on Capitol Hill, I think that is a problem. And that is why the  Detroit Free Press in their editorial call for him to resign.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, because there's a clear public interest here because of  taxpayer money. But now you have this other case involving Republican  Congressman Joe Barton of Texas. InfoWars posted a naked picture of the  congressman that he had sent to a girlfriend, consensual relationship.</p><p>The Washington Post has a recording of Barton telling the woman he would  report to Capitol police if she tries to expose him. But some people are  saying Joe Barton is kind of a victim here of revenge porn.</p><p>TROTTER: It is hard to see that he is a victim of anything besides his own  stupidity. And when you look at a public figure like this in a position of  power, in a position of public notoriety, and you look at the privacy laws  that govern this kind of rape or porn revenge statute, then it is hard to  say how that will play out with someone like this.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. I just want to point that he is not accused of harassing  anyone, but certainly may be guilty of the conduct, as yo said. Let me get  a break here. When we come back, Frank Luntz will join us on whether people  trust all this reporting on this sexual harassment allegations. Later, we  will look at the journalism that prompted three networks to fire Charlie  Rose and how CBS handled it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ: New controversy brewing over President Trump's latest attack on CNN.  Joining us now is Frank Luntz, the veteran political analyst and republican  pollster.</p><p>Frank, let me put this tweet from yesterday up on the screen. Fox News is  much more in the us than CNN, says the president, but outside of the U.S.,  CNN International is still a major source of (fake) news, and they    represent our nation to the world very poorly. The outside world does not  see the truth from them.</p><p>CNN responded, that is not CNN's job to represent the U.S. to the world.  That is yours. Our job is to report the news.</p><p>Does this kind of thing potentially hurt CNN and correspondence around the  world? That the president is so publicly blasting network?</p><p>FRANK LUNTZ, POLITICAL ANALYST AND POLLSTER: Well, it undercuts the  credibility, but I think at least to a bigger point. We are ending a year  that we never dreamed we were going to have. That we would had more  contention, more anger, more division.</p><p>And the media has a responsibility to report the truth, but that  responsibility is essential. And when you undercut them, when it becomes  impossible to look at CNN or read The New York Times and simply not trust  it, then we have a problem. </p><p>KURTZ: So you're making the leap that many people will not trust CNN  because of the constant barrage of fake news. And of course he also says  always say nice things about Fox, which makes people think that Fox is on  the president.</p><p>LUNTZ: I'm not making a leap.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>LUNTZ: Had this on the focus group that I do, the public simply doesn't  trust the media anymore. And that's a mistake, because without an effective  efficient media, how do we know what is truth? How do we get our news?</p><p>I'm very concerned that the fundamental aspects of our democracy are under  threat, which means the news organizations have to be more accurate. They  have to be more careful. And most importantly, they have to be more  accountable. But just trashing them day after day is not helpful to  democracy.</p><p>KURTZ: So in the case of Roy Moore, for example, you have nine women who  did not know each other making these accusations. He has chosen to attack  The Washington Post. One of his aides said it was a worthless piece of  crap. The Post didn't report all of these allegations, many of them. Do you  think that this is having an impact on Alabama Republicans who are more  inclined to distrust the media and believe these women?</p><p>LUNTZ: That is the whole problem. If this had been Bill Clinton, imagine  what the Republicans would have said. They would have demanded his  impeachment, his resignation. But it is perfectly acceptable if it is a  Republican or at least they turned a blind eye. That is not right.</p><p>KURTZ: And the same thing with because you Democrats like Al Franken and  John Conyers, Republicans would criticize them, conservatives and Democrats  will hold back a bit but more likely to criticize Moore or president  himself.</p><p>LUNTZ: If you're going to drain the swamp, that is Republicans and  Democrats alike, if you sever the country, you don't sever one-third of the  country, you serve every American. And in these focus groups I am doing,  the level of distrust and anger is even higher today than it was on  election day.</p><p>And frankly, we have a president and a congress and a news media where all  of us are responsible for this level of cynicism and it is only getting  worse.</p><p>KURTZ: Now, Charlie Rose in 24 hours have lost his positions at CBS, PBS,  Bloomberg over the sexual misconduct allegations. You've been interviewed  by him many time. You've been a consultant at CBS News for half-dozen  years? What do make of what happened?</p><p>LUNTZ: I think of what it means. He was the most respected journalist in  America one week ago when you last had you show. And today he is the least  respected. What does that do for our faith and confidence in the democratic  processes? At some point, you start to see it unraveling. And people say  well, it is not civil war, it is the revolutionary war. We have had worse  times. The fact is we never had worse times in the TV air.</p><p>KURTZ: Briefly was a great personal disappointment to you because you know  Charlie and have worked with him.</p><p>LUNTZ: You know, it's funny. I don't see it from my own personal  perspective, I see it from a national perspective, and it is a tragedy. And  I love how Gayle King handled it, because she spoke straight to the camera  without a teleprompter and she spoke from her heart.</p><p>KURTZ: We are going to get to that in just a few moments, and we will see  you a little bit later in the program. Frank, thanks very much. Ahead, The  New York Times suspends White House reporter Glenn Thrush after another  story of allege sexual harassment. But up next, the fate of CNN after the  Justice Department tried to block a big mega merger. And President Trump  taunts Time over the upcoming \"Person of the Year.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump says he is taking a pass on Times's \"Person of the  Year\" honor after winning last year, Trump tweeted, but the magazine called  to say he would probably be named, but would have to agree to do an  interview with a major photo shoot, and he said probably that is not good  enough.</p><p>Now, Time called that account inaccurate and the pick will remain secret  until early December. What exactly is the magazine denying? Time does  arrange advance interviews and photo sessions with the finalist. So, is  president trying to save face or just working the refs here?</p><p>The future of CNN got murkier this week as the Justice Department filed  suit to block AT&amp;T from taking over the network's parent company Time  Warner. And President Trump, well, let's just he approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, sir -- what do you think  about it?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I'm not going to get involved in litigation. But, personally,  I've always felt that was a deal that's not good for the county. I think  your pricing is going to go up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Trump has made no secret of his disdain for CNN, so some media  outlets suggest that is what is behind the lawsuit. But the DOJ, whether it  is prodded by Trump or not, raises some key issues in trying to block this  $85 billion merger. AT&amp;T will control a lot of content including HBO and  TNT which had a lot of sports.</p><p>And because the company already owns direct TV, Justice argues it would  mean higher monthly TV for for consumers. AT&amp;T says that is nonsense, but  these are perfectly reasonable anti-trust concerns. If the Trump  administration didn't take over, CNN will just keep operating as it has  been and probably keep ticking off the president.</p><p>Some pundits have had fun with Rand Paul over that attacked by his neighbor  that left him with six broken ribs. Now, the senator's wife, Kelley, says  in CNN op-ed that her husband has not taken a single breath without pain  and has pneumonia. She dismisses concocted theories about some ongoing  landscaping dispute with the neighbor.</p><p>\"It is incredibly hurtful that some news outlets have victimized Rand a  second time as he struggles to recover, delighting in hateful headlines  like 'not a perfect neighbor.' This was not a scuffle, a fight, or an  altercation, as many in the media falsely described it. It was a  deliberate, blindside attack.\" Well, she's right. And that hurts.</p><p>Ahead, the president generates more headlines by punching back at sports  figures. Is that just a distraction? But first, the stunningly swift  downfall of Charlie Rose and his media empire.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE, TELEVISION JOURNALIST AND TALK SHOW HOST: Today, a New Yorker  article online by Ronan Farrow shares accounts from several women who have  come forward about sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: It took just 24 hours for CBS to fire Charlie Rose as the morning  co-anchor and \"60 Minutes\" correspondent and for PBS and Bloomberg to drop  his nightly talk show. This after The Washington Post reported eight woman  saying he groped them, walked around naked, and engaged in other forms of  sexual misconduct. Post reporter Amy Brittain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMY BRITTAIN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Within the office, this is  relatively pretty well known. And I think that many of them have a  tremendous fear about speaking out against someone who is powerful as Mr.  Rose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Rose said in a statement, I deeply apologize for my inappropriate  behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times  and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe all these  allegations are accurate. </p><p>Rose's former colleagues in CBS this morning tackled the issue head on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING:  I have held him in such high regard  and I'm really struggling because how do you -- what do you say when  somebody that you deeply care about has done something that is so horrible?  How do you wrap your brain around that? </p><p>NORAH O'DONNELL, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING:  Let me be very clear, there is  no excuse for this alleged behavior. It is systematic and pervasive. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  CBS News spoke to three unidentified women at the network who made  allegations, one saying Rose whispered a sexual innuendo while  inappropriately touching her and former Rose intern Sarah Gordon told NBC  he once showed her a sexually charged movie. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH GORDON, FORMER CHARLIE ROSE INTERN:  And he proceeded to turn on the  film, \"Secretary,\" which is a, you know, sexually involved film involving  sex (ph) and unfortunately -- and he asked me how does this make you feel?  You know, (INAUDIBLE) does it turn you on? That kind of stuff. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Joining our panel now from New York is Liz Claman who anchors  \"Countdown to the Closing Bell\" at 3:00 eastern on the Fox Business  Network. Liz, despite Charlie Rose's stature in the business, 24 hours and  he lost all of his media empire really. What does that tell you? </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, ANCHOR, FBN COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL:  It tells me that  the atmosphere right now enables a situation that has not been allowed to  get out there in a long time. But it is also quite interesting to see and  terrifying for anybody who either is accused of this or knows in their mind  and yet hasn't been outed yet. That they too may be up for scrutiny on this  issue, and that is that careers will be erased if this type of behavior is  outed or it continues. </p><p>And that's pretty fascinating. I mean, it's the title of the show as  Mediabuzz, the power of the press appears at this point when it comes to  this thread of discussion, never to have been greater. The power of the  press right now enables an article to come out and say the \"Washington  post,\" the \"New York Times\" or a piece on \"Vox\" one day, and the next they  sometimes even that night, people's careers have been vaporized. </p><p>They not only lose their shows, as you know Howie, but they will lose any  affiliations. You know, the big news over the weekend was that Charlie Rose  just had two journalistic accolades taken away from him from the Cronkite  School and another journalism school in Kansas. And that really speaks  volumes. People don't want to touch this anymore and that culture of  silence is now very loudly out there. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right. You know, I've been interviewed on Charlie Rose's show a few  times. He is very talented broadcaster and yet, when you read the graphic  details in this \"Washington Post\" story, I was not surprised that this all  happened so quickly. But this new atmosphere you talk about do you think it  can go too far? Do you think it's a healthy development? </p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, you know, you can't suddenly conflate every single situation  that's coming out there. There seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to do that.  Put them all on the same level playing field. Charlie Rose is not Harvey  Weinstein. And Harvey Weinstein is a criminal type of situation where there  can be allegations of rape. </p><p>We got to be careful about putting every single one of these. Marc Halperin  for example is not the same as a Louis C.K. who is not the same as a Kevin  Spacey. The Kevin Spacey and the Harvey Weinstein's of the world dealing  with actual actionable situations where there could be a criminal case, but  we haven't seen any trial. We've seen no arrests. We have seen no  indictments. </p><p>And I think that people have to be careful about this. Nonetheless, that  culture of silence has gone away and people are concerned now that, you  know, be careful of what you say and what you do in the workplace. </p><p>KURTZ:  Most of the original allegations, Gayle Trotter, were about  Charlie's PBS show which he kind of ran as a private (INAUDIBLE). But with  CBS News reporting is more recent allegations and the three women not  identified who work in CBS, how significant was that? </p><p>GAYLE TROTTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Oh, very significant because we're  seeing -- I think Americans are disgusted that the entire entertainment,  media and political world are infested with these men who are taking  advantage of their privileged positions of power to abuse women who are  relying on them and trusting them. </p><p>And so, when we see this happening in the media industry, we see a  fundamental shift in reporting of this because they see that it's infesting  them and you see it at CBS, you see it at NPR, you see at PBS, you see at  all of these other media organizations and this is -- Harvey Weinstein was  a tipping point. </p><p>KURTZ:  Ironically, a longtime producer of Charlie Rose's PBS show, Yvette  Vega, she told the \"Washington Post\" that she failed because some of these  women went to her with these complaints and she did not help them. And she  says that she should have. It's not easy covering these allegations at your  own news organization, believe me, but Juan Williams, Gayle King, and Norah  O'Donnell, you know, led off the show two straight days and spoke out very  strongly. That's the guy who they sat with for six years as a friend and  colleague, that's hard. </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, FOX NEWS THE FIVE:  I think it's very hard now. I  was very impressed with Gayle King because she spoke not only to the camera  but from the heart and saying that this is someone that she deeply admired,  but that he had engaged in horrific behavior and I think there's an  important point to be made here about the power differential, that while  these events did not occur at CBS or PBS, they took place in his own  company. His company produced the Charlie Rose Show and then syndicated it  essentially to PBS. And so he had power over these women. So it was a power  differential. </p><p>KURTZ:  And some of them were applying for jobs. Let me turn to this other  story, the \"New York Times\" this week suspending star White House  correspondent Glenn Thrush who is also an MSNBC contributor and has been  portrayed on SNL. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN THRUSH, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Sarah, sort of a  followup on what you were talking about, our obsession with Russia and  responsibility -- </p><p>MELISSA MCCARTHY, ACTRESS:  Glenn Thrush, New York Times, boom! Go ahead. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Laura McGann wrote on the website Vox that Thrush when they both  worked for \"Politico\" once tried to kiss her and put his hand on her thigh  after drinks in a Virginia bar. And she interviewed two other women who  complained of unwanted advances. The \"Times\" said his behavior was not in  keeping with the paper's values. </p><p>And Thrush, while disputing McGann's own account said, I apologize to any  woman who felt uncomfortable in my presence and for any situation where I  behaved inappropriately. Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected  or uncomfortable is unacceptable. </p><p>And Liz you were saying we have to make this distinctions but you know,  Thrush essentially was accused of being overly aggressive in many of these  cases. There's not a case where it's consensual. Is that in a different  category and is that perhaps why the \"New York Times\" is just suspending  him at this time? </p><p>CLAMAN:  It is in a different category. But the most egregious thing  perhaps about say for example a Glenn Thrush is the pattern where he would  be at events off-site from the \"New York Times,\" he would get people  inebriated or they of their own volition would do so. Then he'd toss a  twenty to somebody who was there as a third person say take a cab a home  I'll pay for it so I can be alone with this person. </p><p>Remember, Harvey Weinstein tossed a $100 bill at a kitchen person or a  dishwasher and said get out of the kitchen while I'm giving this woman a  tour. And then, he would make his move. That is very different from the  Harvey Weinstein situation but in the end, perhaps the most egregious  situation about Glenn Thrush is the scores of woman he may have deterred  from entering the journalism world. We'll never know what great stories  they would have broken or how they would have contributed to the world of  journalism. </p><p>That said, the \"New York Times\" came armed and prepared as did CBS. And let  me just quickly add this, I thought CBS's David Rhodes, the president,  handled it really well because the point he made was, and I even wrote it  down. He said, despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution, there  is nothing more important than enduring the safe and, you know,  professional workplace. But a supportive environment where people feel they  can do their best work. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  There is no criminal part here.</p><p>KURTZ:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But if you run a business, it's criminal if people are being  prevented from doing their best work, and the company loses money. </p><p>KURTZ:  Just briefly, Gayle, Glenn thrush said that he has a drinking  problem, that he's seeking treatment for alcoholism and the \"New York  Times\" is supporting that, so that's a big step. </p><p>TROTTER:  Well, if that's acceptable. I mean, we've seen a lot of excuses  by these powerful men about, you know, Kevin Spacey said well, I'm gay, and  we've had many people tried to come up with excuses for why that they've  engaged in this behavior. But the truth is, it's great that the media have  changed and are finally reporting on this because there are credible  allegations, patterns of behavior and it's not going to be tolerated  anymore. </p><p>KURTZ:  All right. Gayle Trotter, Juan Williams, Liz Claman in New York.  Thanks very much for joining us. </p><p>And the parent company of Fox News which has had its own high profile  problems with sexual misconduct allegations reached a settlement this week.  If approved by a judge, 21st Century Fox will receive $90 million to settle  claims by a shareholder. The money will come from insurance companies  covering Fox executives and Fox directors and from the estate of the late  Fox News chairman Roger Ailes. Fox also agreed to create a council to  improve the work place environment.</p><p>Com ing up, President Trump in a twitter war with a seemingly ungrateful  sports dad whose son was freed from Chinese custody, and later, why the  social media czars are ticking off just about everyone. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BHREAK)</p><p>KURTZ:  President Trump is back on the sports battlefield for persuading  Chinese President Xi to free three UCLA basketball players arrested for  shoplifting. Trump was not pleased when LaVar Ball, a father of one player  refused to thank him. Now that the three basketball players are out of  China and safe from years in jail says the president, LaVar Ball, father of  LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is  no big deal. I should have left them in jail. We have a sound bite here? </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR:  But he thinks that he did something for the boys  and he should be thanked and instead you took a shot at him. </p><p>LAVAR BALL, FATHER OF LIANGELO BALL:  OK, fine. If he thinks it, that's  fine. If he thinks -- I didn't took a shot at him. </p><p>CUOMO:  You did. </p><p>BALL:  Somebody asked me a question, man. I give them my opinion. But I  ain't taking no shot of the president. For what? I don't know him like  that. </p><p>CUOMO:  It sounded like you were taking a shot at the president. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  The president sure is taking shots at him calling LaVar Ball an  ungrateful fool. And we're back with Frank Luntz, big sports fan. So the  president is ticked off. The media hate it when the President Trump gets  into his twitter spats, but they can't get enough of it. And so that became  -- that sort of really got traction. </p><p>FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Well, the problem is that no sports fan wants  politics to intervene on the court, on the field. </p><p>KURTZ:  Good luck with that.</p><p>LUNTZ:  And no politician wants sports to intervene with -- I'll be curious  to see whether people turn off this segment. What bothers me about this -- </p><p>KURTZ:  Only if you don't keep the interest level up. </p><p>LUNTZ:  What bothers me about this is that with everything that's going on  in the world, in Washington, across the globe, that this becomes some big  issue that it makes its way onto the news pages of the newspaper. </p><p>KURTZ:  But the president wants it to be a big issue. He thrives on things  like that and the press portrays this as a character flaw. Why is he  punching down on an odd ball like LaVar Ball? Must be he hadn't heard of --</p><p>LUNTZ:  But in this case --</p><p>KURTZ:  --but reporters have a different view of these bites. </p><p>LUNTZ:  Right but in this case, I think Donald Trump is correct. Why do not  show humility? Why do not express thanks to a president whether or not you  like or dislike them? They president still intervened. He went out of his  way and those kids could have been in serious trouble and I remind LaVar  ball that his son broke the law. His son was a criminal in a foreign  country. That was a stupid thing to do and the president still acted to  protect --</p><p>KURTZ:  I agree with you on the substance. I still can't wrap my head  around why a simple thank you was not -- why he was not capable of that.  So, in other sports related thing, big football fan. Here is another tweet  from the president. Remember the Oakland Raiders, Marshown Lynch of the  NFL's Oakland Raisders stands for the Mexican anthem and sits down to boos  for our national anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him  for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.</p><p>Now, I personally think that a lot of the media don't like Trump pushing  these NFL protest. I think it's worked well for him. It's controversial,  but a lot of his supporters like it. But to suggest that a particular  player be suspended or potentially suspended, does that cross a line? </p><p>LUNTZ:  Let me take you back to Richard Nixon when supposedly he had a play  given to Coach Allen and everybody went nuts. What he hell is the president  giving plays to a coach?</p><p>KURTZ:  Right.</p><p>LUNTZ:  You know, the American people agree with Trump on this and it has  caused a lot of damage for the NFL. That said, is this what a president  should be doing? And particularly when you're protesting if there is a  military person singing the national anthem, which is what happened this  last Thursday at a Redskins stadium. And the player says, hey, I'm trying  to draw attention to what's happening in the black community. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right. Yes.</p><p>LUNTZ:  There is a right way and a wrong way to do that. Just as these  twitter wars are wrong, not standing for the national anthem is wrong. I  believe we have to respect the players and the messages they're sending.  Just do it the right way at the right time for the right reasons. </p><p>KURTZ:  Football fan, Frank Luntz, thanks very much for joining us. After  the break, what is it now it seems that everybody hates Facebook and  Twitter and Google? Steve Hilton on whether we should we blame the tech  giants or ourselves? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ:  How do we reach a point where the big tech companies that everyone  used to admire now so unpopular? I spoke earlier with Steve Hilton, the  tech entrepreneur and host of Fox's \"The Next Revolution\" from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ:  Steve Hilton, welcome. </p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS NEXT REVOLUTION:  Good to be with you, Howie.</p><p>KURTZ:  Twitter, Google, Facebook, I mean these were the hot new companies,  the glittering brand names with cool CEO's. Now, everybody seems to be mad  at them. What happened? </p><p>HILTON:  It's interesting isn't it because as you say, it's everyone. It's  the left and the right. Everyone, whichever way you look at it. These big  tech companies are too powerful and the way that they use their power is  harmful to what they foresee to be the public interest. If you look at  particularly a company like Facebook I think in the firing line,  particularly from the left over what they perceive to be the platform's  role in helping the Russians to swing the election against Hillary Clinton  and for Donald Trump. </p><p>But if you look on the other side, you've got Republicans who believe that  these big tech companies are run by die-hard liberals who are using their  power over the information that we consume and the way that people connect  with each other to push an agenda of liberal values. And so I think all of  these problems really are a consequence of the massive success of these  companies in producing tools and products that billions of people around  the world want to use. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right. Yes, they've all been dragged into this special counsel's  investigation for allowing phony Russian sites access and taking ads from  these Russians or Kremlin-linked groups. Even Google and Facebook now  saying they'd be willing to take some federal regulation of online ads. But  why can't they do a better job of policing their own content? Is it because  they cling to this fiction that they're not really media companies when in  fact they are among the most powerful media companies on earth?</p><p>HILTON:  Well there are two parts I think. The first answer is there is  just so much of it that the sheer scale of the content, the number of hours  of content that's uploaded every second to YouTube, the amount of, you  know, think about of the 2 billion people using Facebook. It's just so much  that actually it's very difficult to police that or, you know, using  automated means because even though we hear a lot these days about  artificial intelligence and what's called machine learning and natural  language processing where computers if you like try and understand the  meaning of different words and trying then understand what's going on. </p><p>Actually, all that is still in its infancy and so to police the content for  example, to spark terrorist plotting or child abuse, those sorts of things.  Actually, it's pretty difficult. </p><p>KURTZ:  I get it. I get that it's a fact of life --</p><p>HILTON:  On the other hand, if you want to do this manually, it costs a  huge, you know, you go to employ not just tens of thousands but hundreds of  thousands of people. That would be their argument. That's just really  difficult to do.</p><p>KURTZ:  Well, they make lots of money. It's about money. They don't want to  spend the money. I guess Facebook are now going to hire another 10,000 fact  checkers. It's just interesting you talk about these companies getting  badder from the left and the right. Twitter is now going to remove the blue  verification for prominent people if in Twitter's judgment those people  post hateful or racist messages. </p><p>When you get into hateful, you start attacking politicians, is that  hateful? Could they come under fire for exercising that judgment in a way  that's controversial particularly as you say these Silicon Valley companies  are perceived as being run by liberals? </p><p>HILTON:  Yes, it's a really big issue. And I think one of the arguments  that you hear a lot from the right particularly is that there is a double  standard. Their judgment, the company's judgment of what is hateful  actually is driven by their politics. So for example ads that promote pro- life position are considered to be provocative, and hate speech, and you've  seen that. You've seen YouTube getting into hot water over classifying  conservative philosophical instruction videos as contravening their  guidelines. </p><p>KURTZ:  Final point, are we all partially to blame? Do we give these tech  companies and these sites too much of our time, too much of our information  and then we grumble about it? </p><p>HILTON:  Yes, I think that is right. On the next revolution, we regularly  come back to this point about the impact of technology on our humanity and  it's something I feel very strongly about. I wrote a book about it. I  advocate -- I don't use a smart phone for example. I haven't had a  smartphone for five years and I live perfectly without it. </p><p>KURTZ:  How do you survive? You live here in Silicon Valley. You don't use  a smartphone. This is a revelation! </p><p>HILTON:  I don't use and I haven't for five years and life goes on. It's  perfectly fine. And so I'm really concerned about the way there are phones  in particular have made people basically addicted to this technology. But  that doesn't absolve the companies from their own responsibility whether  it's in terms of their market power, their dominance over a particular  market for example online advertising or their power over information. </p><p>And I think that they definitely need to take all these issues much more  seriously than they have in the past. I think to be fair to them, they are  realizing that now and they are starting to think much more deeply about  their broadest social impact. </p><p>KURTZ:  Steve, I'm sorry. I lost track of what you're saying I was just  checking my feed here. Steve Hilton, thanks very much for joining us. Great  to see you. </p><p>HILTON:  Great to see you. Thank s Howie.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ:  Life goes on. Still to come, \"Newsweek\" and a new low in comparing  Donald Trump to the most evil people on the planet. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ:  Even in the media and entertainment culture that feels free to  compare to Donald Trump to the worst villains in human history, this was a  new low. \"Newsweek\" used this week's death of Charles Manson to compare the  president to the cult leader, who happen to be a mass murderer. This  utterly illogical connection rested on one psychologist who said both Trump  and Manson use emotional anguish to appeal to alienated people or  something. </p><p>But even the person said he wasn't comparing Trump and Manson though that  did not stop \"Newsweek.\" The magazine later deleted all references to the  president saying the original piece didn't meet its editorial standards  which were sadly missing in action. Just pathetic. </p><p>Well that's it for this edition of Mediabuzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope  you're all enjoying a good Thanksgiving weekend. Check out our Facebook  page.

This as The New York Times suspends star White House correspondent Glenn Thrush over harassment allegations. And as Roy Moore accuser Leigh Corfman goes on NBC, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>defends the embattled Alabama senate candidate and is denounced by many of the pundits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEIGH CORFMAN, ROY MOORE ACCUSER: He basically laid out some blankets on the floor of his living room and proceeded to seduce me.

This as three more women accused <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>of probing them. He keeps on apologizing. And Congressman John Conyers admits settling a former staffer suit that included claims of sexual harassment. Is the press covering these cases fairly?</p><p>Plus, Trump getting into Twitter words with NFL protester Marshawn Lynch and the father of UCLA basketball player the president got sprung from Chinese custody. The pundits scorecard says he's picking the wrong fights, but is that true? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"</p><p>After <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>initial statement that Roy Moore should get out of the Alabama senate race if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, he suddenly seems to shift his stance. That was after Leigh Corfman, who first told The Washington Post that Moore sexually accosted her when she was 14 appeared on \"The Today Show\" and explain why she did not speak out when Moore first got into politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORFMAN: My children were small. I was a single parent. And when you're in that situation, you do everything you can to protect your own. So when The Washington Post sought me out, I didn't come looking for this. This fell in my lap.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: When the president took questions from reporters, he made clear he wanted the former judge in the senate over Democrat Doug Jones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is an accused child molester better than a Democrat? It is an accused child molester better than a Democrat?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, he denies it. He denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it did not happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: And the New York tabloids reacting with these headlines. Striking the same theme. Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Ellison Barber, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>correspondent here in Washington; Gayle Trotter, political commentator who contributes to The Daily Caller and The Hill; and Juan Williams, co- host of The Five.</p><p>Ellison, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>comments as we just saw causing a huge media uproar, because he was seen as essentially endorsing Roy Moore in the Alabama race. Has the White House pushed back on that?</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS</nameText></person>: It's a non-endorsement endorsement. Initially you had the White House saying, as we heard earlier, saying that if these allegations are true, he should step down. And they repeatedly said that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>wants the voters of Alabama to decide. He had noticeably not said anything about it until those comments on the south lawn.</p><p>Then yo had the comments on the south lawn. Then you had him tweet again today that it's better than a Pelosi or Schumer puppet. So, I mean, there is only so much they can push back at some point. The White House can say as much as they want that he wants the voters of Alabama to decide, whatever, that if he thinks the allegations are true, then he should step down.</p><p>I believe they have also said that he considered the allegations troubling. It doesn't really matter when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>comes out and then says what he has said. I think we have to take his words more than anything from the press secretary.</p><p>KURTZ: Gale, much of the media are portraying this is a dramatic shift for <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And they say, well, if he is essentially siding with Roy Moore or attacking a Democrat which is kind of the same thing, that shows he doesn't care about these sexual harassment allegations. Is that a lift (ph) the president making?</p><p>GAYLE TROTTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That is a lift (ph). And just think about what you said, his previous position was that if the allegations were true, he should step down. And then when he spoke to the press this week, he said that he totally denied it. Forty years was a long time ago. There have been multiple races where this hasn't come up.</p><p>So I would say he has changed his position. And when asked by the media specifically was he going to go down to Alabama and campaign for Roy Moore, he said I will decide next week. So, saying that he has taken a different position is an unfair characterization and saying that he is endorsing Roy Moore is inconsistent as well with the facts.</p><p>KURTZ: The press does not seem to be buying that argument. They are saying that in effect and this is not everybody in journalism, but many say that in effect, if he is saying the Democrat is terrible and you got to listen to Roy Moore's denials, he is kind of sending a signal. So is there a leak (INAUDIBLE) question I asked Gayle?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, THE FIVE: No, I think you have to put it in the political context, Howie, and the political context is this. Remember, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>did not back Judge Moore in the republican primary in the state of Alabama.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He picked the incumbent, the appointee Luther Strange. So, what you get is a situation where then once Roy Moore won the seat, there was pressure on him, I think he felt somewhat, you know, hey maybe I made the wrong call earlier. My base is with Judge Moore. The (INAUDIBLE) community is strong there.</p><p>KURTZ: Is the press reading him right? Is the press --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think they're right.</p><p>KURTZ: -- interpreting what he is doing here with --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I do not think there is any question that Steve Bannon who has been involved in this and is part of the push in the press by the way at Breitbart, to get people to look at Roy Moore differently has also influenced <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>So, while it may be fear (ph), as Gayle points out, I have to say, well, he really hasn't changed. I think the statement that he made going out to the helicopter before the Thanksgiving holiday was far more aggressive and public in terms of support for Moore than anything that he had done before.</p><p>BARBER: I think part of the context too is <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>did not speak about it until the south lawn. So in terms of did he change is a matter of he said this, his press team said this.</p><p>KURTZ: Many of these politicians try to avoid the media allegations. So for example, Roy Moore, the initial radio conversation with Sean Hannity, has not talked to a journalist. Now he may be can do that, of course he got twice as many accusers now as in the beginning, but the president is constantly in photo ops and opportunities, he ultimately does not have that option, does he? Just saying nothing?</p><p>BARBER: Not necessarily. Sometimes, you see instances where reporters shout questions and he keeps walking by, so he can certainly strategically avoid them if he wants or not answer. I do think whether people love or hate <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>I think the most thing that everyone agrees on is that he usually does not, I don't think, usually ignore a whole lot of questions.</p><p>I think when the questions are thrown at him sometimes, I think his press office would wish that he doesn't. I think he usually answers or responds with Twitter or whatever. He usually is better about responding. That is why it was particularly notable initially and why so many people talked about ho he hadn't commented on Roy Moore.</p><p>KURTZ: He engages with reporters a lot more than he used to. More than most presidents, I must say. Now, you've seen stories, segments trying to resurrect the harassment allegations against <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>himself. About a dozen women who made these allegations at the end of the campaign last year. He has called them horrible liars. Is it fair or unfair for the media now to revive that issue?</p><p>TROTTER: Certainly relevant for the media to bring that up, because it is historically interesting and it gives color to the story, and it certainly gives an insight into what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is thinking. And if he truly believes that these women were liars, then that could show why he would be more likely to support Roy Moore and think that there should be a presumption of innocence.</p><p>And like Juan was saying, I was a little surprised that he did not come out and say, well, I was right, I supported the challenger to Roy Moore. And like Ellison was saying, there is no filter on him and so he has the ability to go out there and say that. It is a little surprising that he didn't say, hey, I was right, you should have listened to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think what surprised me too to pick up on this point is, that he then opened the door to the media criticism of his past and going back. Now the argument would be that voters are different than a private employer. You mentioned some cases at the top of the show, <person><nameText>Charlie Rose, </nameText></person>Glenn Thrush and others. These are people who are in the public eye, but they really work for a private enterprise, a media organization.</p><p>KURTZ: There is no verdict by the voters.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Correct. But here with <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>there was a verdict by the voters. And some people say, well, does that mean that they were judge and jury with regard to the sexual harassment claims? Or did they prefer him as president? I don't know if they were truly judge and jury, but I think lots of people in <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>camp say, that issue is dead because the voters --</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, I don't say that, some people misinterpreted what I said on the show last week, just noting that there was an election at these allegations. Ivanka Trump certainly has said she believes the women involved. The president is taking a different stance. And I guess, you know, that does lead lots of questions of why these women accused you.</p><p>You say that they are not telling the truth and maybe he is skeptical of Roy Moore. Let me go a little more here because the spotlight now is shifting to the Democrats. If I can just go through, three more accusers since last week saying that Senator <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>grabbed them. But in photo ap, one picture of one woman, at least we can put that up, Linsay Menz. He has apologized again. He said he crossed line. And senator is going to talk to Minnesota reporters later today.</p><p>Eighty-eight-year-old John Conyers, Democrat, dean of the House actually, first reported by BuzzFeed that he secretly used $27,000 taxpayers money to settle a former staffer suite that included allegations of sexual harassment. He denies it. In terms of media coverage, is this all becoming a blur? Is it muddying the waters about who did what?</p><p>BARBER: I do not know if I would say a blur. I guess it depends on how you think of blurt? I think in terms of just the amount of information that is being thrown at a reader, maybe there is a lot to process and digest. I feel like everyday, I am trying to keep up with it.</p><p>KURTZ: Right, and we do this for a living.</p><p>BARBER: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: But also, are there important distinctions to be made about the level of conduct or harassment compared to people who have been accused of sexual assault or rape?</p><p>BARBER: Yes, absolutely. I think the difference can be seen usually in the reporting. I think that is the reporters job, is to accurately portray sort of where this falls and whether it is child molester, rape accusation or something else, but that doesn't mean it should be covered simply because there are other major --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Let me just say. Another distinction to be made, in the Conyers case, the allegation -- I think it is more of an allegation now. You could correct me if I'm wrong. He used taxpayer dollars --</p><p>KURTZ: No, that's a fact.</p><p>WILLIAMS: that is office funds to buy off or silence --</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- this woman.</p><p>KURTZ: This was just a couple of years ago and it was done in secret.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. That is the case, that is different than what we are talking about. Other cases, I do not know about settlements, but the idea that you're using public funds, if that is not an exception, not common practice on Capitol Hill, I think that is a problem. And that is why the Detroit Free Press in their editorial call for him to resign.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, because there's a clear public interest here because of taxpayer money. But now you have this other case involving Republican Congressman Joe Barton of Texas. InfoWars posted a naked picture of the congressman that he had sent to a girlfriend, consensual relationship.</p><p>The Washington Post has a recording of Barton telling the woman he would report to Capitol police if she tries to expose him. But some people are saying Joe Barton is kind of a victim here of revenge porn.</p><p>TROTTER: It is hard to see that he is a victim of anything besides his own stupidity. And when you look at a public figure like this in a position of power, in a position of public notoriety, and you look at the privacy laws that govern this kind of rape or porn revenge statute, then it is hard to say how that will play out with someone like this.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. I just want to point that he is not accused of harassing anyone, but certainly may be guilty of the conduct, as yo said. Let me get a break here. When we come back, Frank Luntz will join us on whether people trust all this reporting on this sexual harassment allegations. Later, we will look at the journalism that prompted three networks to fire <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>and how CBS handled it.</p><p>KURTZ: New controversy brewing over <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>latest attack on CNN. Joining us now is Frank Luntz, the veteran political analyst and republican pollster.</p><p>Frank, let me put this tweet from yesterday up on the screen. <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>is much more in the us than CNN, says the president, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (fake) news, and they represent our nation to the world very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them.</p><p>CNN responded, that is not CNN's job to represent the U.S. to the world. That is yours. Our job is to report the news.</p><p>Does this kind of thing potentially hurt CNN and correspondence around the world? That the president is so publicly blasting network?</p><p>FRANK LUNTZ, POLITICAL ANALYST AND POLLSTER: Well, it undercuts the credibility, but I think at least to a bigger point. We are ending a year that we never dreamed we were going to have. That we would had more contention, more anger, more division.</p><p>And the media has a responsibility to report the truth, but that responsibility is essential. And when you undercut them, when it becomes impossible to look at CNN or read The New York Times and simply not trust it, then we have a problem.</p><p>KURTZ: So you're making the leap that many people will not trust CNN because of the constant barrage of fake news. And of course he also says always say nice things about Fox, which makes people think that Fox is on the president.</p><p>LUNTZ: I'm not making a leap.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>LUNTZ: Had this on the focus group that I do, the public simply doesn't trust the media anymore. And that's a mistake, because without an effective efficient media, how do we know what is truth? How do we get our news?</p><p>I'm very concerned that the fundamental aspects of our democracy are under threat, which means the news organizations have to be more accurate. They have to be more careful. And most importantly, they have to be more accountable. But just trashing them day after day is not helpful to democracy.</p><p>KURTZ: So in the case of Roy Moore, for example, you have nine women who did not know each other making these accusations. He has chosen to attack The Washington Post. One of his aides said it was a worthless piece of crap. The Post didn't report all of these allegations, many of them. Do you think that this is having an impact on Alabama Republicans who are more inclined to distrust the media and believe these women?</p><p>LUNTZ: That is the whole problem. If this had been Bill Clinton, imagine what the Republicans would have said. They would have demanded his impeachment, his resignation. But it is perfectly acceptable if it is a Republican or at least they turned a blind eye. That is not right.</p><p>KURTZ: And the same thing with because you Democrats like <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>and John Conyers, Republicans would criticize them, conservatives and Democrats will hold back a bit but more likely to criticize Moore or president himself.</p><p>LUNTZ: If you're going to drain the swamp, that is Republicans and Democrats alike, if you sever the country, you don't sever one-third of the country, you serve every American. And in these focus groups I am doing, the level of distrust and anger is even higher today than it was on election day.</p><p>And frankly, we have a president and a congress and a news media where all of us are responsible for this level of cynicism and it is only getting worse.</p><p>KURTZ: Now, <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>in 24 hours have lost his positions at CBS, PBS, Bloomberg over the sexual misconduct allegations. You've been interviewed by him many time. You've been a consultant at CBS News for half-dozen years? What do make of what happened?</p><p>LUNTZ: I think of what it means. He was the most respected journalist in America one week ago when you last had you show. And today he is the least respected. What does that do for our faith and confidence in the democratic processes? At some point, you start to see it unraveling. And people say well, it is not civil war, it is the revolutionary war. We have had worse times. The fact is we never had worse times in the TV air.</p><p>KURTZ: Briefly was a great personal disappointment to you because you know Charlie and have worked with him.</p><p>LUNTZ: You know, it's funny. I don't see it from my own personal perspective, I see it from a national perspective, and it is a tragedy. And I love how Gayle King handled it, because she spoke straight to the camera without a teleprompter and she spoke from her heart.</p><p>KURTZ: We are going to get to that in just a few moments, and we will see you a little bit later in the program. Frank, thanks very much. Ahead, The New York Times suspends White House reporter Glenn Thrush after another story of allege sexual harassment. But up next, the fate of CNN after the Justice Department tried to block a big mega merger. And <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>taunts Time over the upcoming \"Person of the Year.\"</p><p>KURTZ: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>says he is taking a pass on Times's \"Person of the Year\" honor after winning last year, Trump tweeted, but the magazine called to say he would probably be named, but would have to agree to do an interview with a major photo shoot, and he said probably that is not good enough.</p><p>Now, Time called that account inaccurate and the pick will remain secret until early December. What exactly is the magazine denying? Time does arrange advance interviews and photo sessions with the finalist. So, is president trying to save face or just working the refs here?</p><p>The future of CNN got murkier this week as the Justice Department filed suit to block AT&amp;T from taking over the network's parent company Time Warner. And <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>well, let's just he approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, sir -- what do you think about it?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I'm not going to get involved in litigation. But, personally, I've always felt that was a deal that's not good for the county. I think your pricing is going to go up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Trump has made no secret of his disdain for CNN, so some media outlets suggest that is what is behind the lawsuit. But the DOJ, whether it is prodded by Trump or not, raises some key issues in trying to block this $85 billion merger. AT&amp;T will control a lot of content including HBO and TNT which had a lot of sports.</p><p>And because the company already owns direct TV, Justice argues it would mean higher monthly TV for for consumers. AT&amp;T says that is nonsense, but these are perfectly reasonable anti-trust concerns. If the Trump administration didn't take over, CNN will just keep operating as it has been and probably keep ticking off the president.</p><p>Some pundits have had fun with <person><nameText>Rand Paul </nameText></person>over that attacked by his neighbor that left him with six broken ribs. Now, the senator's wife, Kelley, says in CNN op-ed that her husband has not taken a single breath without pain and has pneumonia. She dismisses concocted theories about some ongoing landscaping dispute with the neighbor.</p><p>\"It is incredibly hurtful that some news outlets have victimized Rand a second time as he struggles to recover, delighting in hateful headlines like 'not a perfect neighbor.' This was not a scuffle, a fight, or an altercation, as many in the media falsely described it. It was a deliberate, blindside attack.\" Well, she's right. And that hurts.</p><p>Ahead, the president generates more headlines by punching back at sports figures. Is that just a distraction? But first, the stunningly swift downfall of <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>and his media empire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE, </nameText></person>TELEVISION JOURNALIST AND TALK SHOW HOST: Today, a New Yorker article online by Ronan Farrow shares accounts from several women who have come forward about sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: It took just 24 hours for CBS to fire <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>as the morning co-anchor and \"60 Minutes\" correspondent and for PBS and Bloomberg to drop his nightly talk show. This after The Washington Post reported eight woman saying he groped them, walked around naked, and engaged in other forms of sexual misconduct. Post reporter Amy Brittain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMY BRITTAIN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Within the office, this is relatively pretty well known. And I think that many of them have a tremendous fear about speaking out against someone who is powerful as Mr. Rose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Rose said in a statement, I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe all these allegations are accurate.</p><p>Rose's former colleagues in CBS this morning tackled the issue head on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: I have held him in such high regard and I'm really struggling because how do you -- what do you say when somebody that you deeply care about has done something that is so horrible? How do you wrap your brain around that?</p><p>NORAH O'DONNELL, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: Let me be very clear, there is no excuse for this alleged behavior. It is systematic and pervasive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: CBS News spoke to three unidentified women at the network who made allegations, one saying Rose whispered a sexual innuendo while inappropriately touching her and former Rose intern Sarah Gordon told NBC he once showed her a sexually charged movie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH GORDON, FORMER <person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE </nameText></person>INTERN: And he proceeded to turn on the film, \"Secretary,\" which is a, you know, sexually involved film involving sex (ph) and unfortunately -- and he asked me how does this make you feel? You know, (INAUDIBLE) does it turn you on? That kind of stuff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining our panel now from New York is Liz Claman who anchors \"Countdown to the Closing Bell\" at 3:00 eastern on the Fox Business Network. Liz, despite <person><nameText>Charlie Rose's </nameText></person>stature in the business, 24 hours and he lost all of his media empire really. What does that tell you?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, ANCHOR, FBN COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL: It tells me that the atmosphere right now enables a situation that has not been allowed to get out there in a long time. But it is also quite interesting to see and terrifying for anybody who either is accused of this or knows in their mind and yet hasn't been outed yet. That they too may be up for scrutiny on this issue, and that is that careers will be erased if this type of behavior is outed or it continues.</p><p>And that's pretty fascinating. I mean, it's the title of the show as Mediabuzz, the power of the press appears at this point when it comes to this thread of discussion, never to have been greater. The power of the press right now enables an article to come out and say the \"Washington post,\" the \"New York Times\" or a piece on \"Vox\" one day, and the next they sometimes even that night, people's careers have been vaporized.</p><p>They not only lose their shows, as you know Howie, but they will lose any affiliations. You know, the big news over the weekend was that <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>just had two journalistic accolades taken away from him from the Cronkite School and another journalism school in Kansas. And that really speaks volumes. People don't want to touch this anymore and that culture of silence is now very loudly out there.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. You know, I've been interviewed on <person><nameText>Charlie Rose's </nameText></person>show a few times. He is very talented broadcaster and yet, when you read the graphic details in this \"Washington Post\" story, I was not surprised that this all happened so quickly. But this new atmosphere you talk about do you think it can go too far? Do you think it's a healthy development?</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, you know, you can't suddenly conflate every single situation that's coming out there. There seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to do that. Put them all on the same level playing field. <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>is not Harvey Weinstein. And Harvey Weinstein is a criminal type of situation where there can be allegations of rape.</p><p>We got to be careful about putting every single one of these. Marc Halperin for example is not the same as a Louis C.K. who is not the same as a Kevin Spacey. The Kevin Spacey and the Harvey Weinstein's of the world dealing with actual actionable situations where there could be a criminal case, but we haven't seen any trial. We've seen no arrests. We have seen no indictments.</p><p>And I think that people have to be careful about this. Nonetheless, that culture of silence has gone away and people are concerned now that, you know, be careful of what you say and what you do in the workplace.</p><p>KURTZ: Most of the original allegations, Gayle Trotter, were about Charlie's PBS show which he kind of ran as a private (INAUDIBLE). But with CBS News reporting is more recent allegations and the three women not identified who work in CBS, how significant was that?</p><p>GAYLE TROTTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Oh, very significant because we're seeing -- I think Americans are disgusted that the entire entertainment, media and political world are infested with these men who are taking advantage of their privileged positions of power to abuse women who are relying on them and trusting them.</p><p>And so, when we see this happening in the media industry, we see a fundamental shift in reporting of this because they see that it's infesting them and you see it at CBS, you see it at NPR, you see at PBS, you see at all of these other media organizations and this is -- Harvey Weinstein was a tipping point.</p><p>KURTZ: Ironically, a longtime producer of <person><nameText>Charlie Rose's </nameText></person>PBS show, Yvette Vega, she told the \"Washington Post\" that she failed because some of these women went to her with these complaints and she did not help them. And she says that she should have. It's not easy covering these allegations at your own news organization, believe me, but Juan Williams, Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, you know, led off the show two straight days and spoke out very strongly. That's the guy who they sat with for six years as a friend and colleague, that's hard.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>THE FIVE: I think it's very hard now. I was very impressed with Gayle King because she spoke not only to the camera but from the heart and saying that this is someone that she deeply admired, but that he had engaged in horrific behavior and I think there's an important point to be made here about the power differential, that while these events did not occur at CBS or PBS, they took place in his own company. His company produced the <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>Show and then syndicated it essentially to PBS. And so he had power over these women. So it was a power differential.</p><p>KURTZ: And some of them were applying for jobs. Let me turn to this other story, the \"New York Times\" this week suspending star White House correspondent Glenn Thrush who is also an MSNBC contributor and has been portrayed on SNL.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN THRUSH, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Sarah, sort of a followup on what you were talking about, our obsession with Russia and responsibility --</p><p>MELISSA MCCARTHY, ACTRESS: Glenn Thrush, New York Times, boom! Go ahead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Laura McGann wrote on the website Vox that Thrush when they both worked for \"Politico\" once tried to kiss her and put his hand on her thigh after drinks in a Virginia bar. And she interviewed two other women who complained of unwanted advances. The \"Times\" said his behavior was not in keeping with the paper's values.</p><p>And Thrush, while disputing McGann's own account said, I apologize to any woman who felt uncomfortable in my presence and for any situation where I behaved inappropriately. Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected or uncomfortable is unacceptable.</p><p>And Liz you were saying we have to make this distinctions but you know, Thrush essentially was accused of being overly aggressive in many of these cases. There's not a case where it's consensual. Is that in a different category and is that perhaps why the \"New York Times\" is just suspending him at this time?</p><p>CLAMAN: It is in a different category. But the most egregious thing perhaps about say for example a Glenn Thrush is the pattern where he would be at events off-site from the \"New York Times,\" he would get people inebriated or they of their own volition would do so. Then he'd toss a twenty to somebody who was there as a third person say take a cab a home I'll pay for it so I can be alone with this person.</p><p>Remember, Harvey Weinstein tossed a $100 bill at a kitchen person or a dishwasher and said get out of the kitchen while I'm giving this woman a tour. And then, he would make his move. That is very different from the Harvey Weinstein situation but in the end, perhaps the most egregious situation about Glenn Thrush is the scores of woman he may have deterred from entering the journalism world. We'll never know what great stories they would have broken or how they would have contributed to the world of journalism.</p><p>That said, the \"New York Times\" came armed and prepared as did CBS. And let me just quickly add this, I thought CBS's David Rhodes, the president, handled it really well because the point he made was, and I even wrote it down. He said, despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution, there is nothing more important than enduring the safe and, you know, professional workplace. But a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: There is no criminal part here.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: But if you run a business, it's criminal if people are being prevented from doing their best work, and the company loses money.</p><p>KURTZ: Just briefly, Gayle, Glenn thrush said that he has a drinking problem, that he's seeking treatment for alcoholism and the \"New York Times\" is supporting that, so that's a big step.</p><p>TROTTER: Well, if that's acceptable. I mean, we've seen a lot of excuses by these powerful men about, you know, Kevin Spacey said well, I'm gay, and we've had many people tried to come up with excuses for why that they've engaged in this behavior. But the truth is, it's great that the media have changed and are finally reporting on this because there are credible allegations, patterns of behavior and it's not going to be tolerated anymore.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Gayle Trotter, Juan Williams, Liz Claman in New York. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>And the parent company of <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>which has had its own high profile problems with sexual misconduct allegations reached a settlement this week. If approved by a judge, 21st Century Fox will receive $90 million to settle claims by a shareholder. The money will come from insurance companies covering Fox executives and Fox directors and from the estate of the late <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>chairman Roger Ailes. Fox also agreed to create a council to improve the work place environment.</p><p>Com ing up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in a twitter war with a seemingly ungrateful sports dad whose son was freed from Chinese custody, and later, why the social media czars are ticking off just about everyone.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BHREAK)</p><p>KURTZ: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is back on the sports battlefield for persuading Chinese President Xi to free three UCLA basketball players arrested for shoplifting. Trump was not pleased when LaVar Ball, a father of one player refused to thank him. Now that the three basketball players are out of China and safe from years in jail says the president, LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail. We have a sound bite here?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: But he thinks that he did something for the boys and he should be thanked and instead you took a shot at him.</p><p>LAVAR BALL, FATHER OF LIANGELO BALL: OK, fine. If he thinks it, that's fine. If he thinks -- I didn't took a shot at him.</p><p>CUOMO: You did.</p><p>BALL: Somebody asked me a question, man. I give them my opinion. But I ain't taking no shot of the president. For what? I don't know him like that.</p><p>CUOMO: It sounded like you were taking a shot at the president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: The president sure is taking shots at him calling LaVar Ball an ungrateful fool. And we're back with Frank Luntz, big sports fan. So the president is ticked off. The media hate it when the <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>gets into his twitter spats, but they can't get enough of it. And so that became -- that sort of really got traction.</p><p>FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: Well, the problem is that no sports fan wants politics to intervene on the court, on the field.</p><p>KURTZ: Good luck with that.</p><p>LUNTZ: And no politician wants sports to intervene with -- I'll be curious to see whether people turn off this segment. What bothers me about this --</p><p>KURTZ: Only if you don't keep the interest level up.</p><p>LUNTZ: What bothers me about this is that with everything that's going on in the world, in Washington, across the globe, that this becomes some big issue that it makes its way onto the news pages of the newspaper.</p><p>KURTZ: But the president wants it to be a big issue. He thrives on things like that and the press portrays this as a character flaw. Why is he punching down on an odd ball like LaVar Ball? Must be he hadn't heard of --</p><p>LUNTZ: But in this case --</p><p>KURTZ: --but reporters have a different view of these bites.</p><p>LUNTZ: Right but in this case, I think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is correct. Why do not show humility? Why do not express thanks to a president whether or not you like or dislike them? They president still intervened. He went out of his way and those kids could have been in serious trouble and I remind LaVar ball that his son broke the law. His son was a criminal in a foreign country. That was a stupid thing to do and the president still acted to protect --</p><p>KURTZ: I agree with you on the substance. I still can't wrap my head around why a simple thank you was not -- why he was not capable of that. So, in other sports related thing, big football fan. Here is another tweet from the president. Remember the Oakland Raiders, Marshown Lynch of the NFL's Oakland Raisders stands for the Mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.</p><p>Now, I personally think that a lot of the media don't like Trump pushing these NFL protest. I think it's worked well for him. It's controversial, but a lot of his supporters like it. But to suggest that a particular player be suspended or potentially suspended, does that cross a line?</p><p>LUNTZ: Let me take you back to Richard Nixon when supposedly he had a play given to Coach Allen and everybody went nuts. What he hell is the president giving plays to a coach?</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>LUNTZ: You know, the American people agree with Trump on this and it has caused a lot of damage for the NFL. That said, is this what a president should be doing? And particularly when you're protesting if there is a military person singing the national anthem, which is what happened this last Thursday at a Redskins stadium. And the player says, hey, I'm trying to draw attention to what's happening in the black community.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Yes.</p><p>LUNTZ: There is a right way and a wrong way to do that. Just as these twitter wars are wrong, not standing for the national anthem is wrong. I believe we have to respect the players and the messages they're sending. Just do it the right way at the right time for the right reasons.</p><p>KURTZ: Football fan, Frank Luntz, thanks very much for joining us. After the break, what is it now it seems that everybody hates Facebook and Twitter and Google? Steve Hilton on whether we should we blame the tech giants or ourselves?</p><p>KURTZ: How do we reach a point where the big tech companies that everyone used to admire now so unpopular? I spoke earlier with Steve Hilton, the tech entrepreneur and host of Fox's \"The Next Revolution\" from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: Steve Hilton, welcome.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NEXT REVOLUTION: Good to be with you, Howie.</p><p>KURTZ: Twitter, Google, Facebook, I mean these were the hot new companies, the glittering brand names with cool CEO's. Now, everybody seems to be mad at them. What happened?</p><p>HILTON: It's interesting isn't it because as you say, it's everyone. It's the left and the right. Everyone, whichever way you look at it. These big tech companies are too powerful and the way that they use their power is harmful to what they foresee to be the public interest. If you look at particularly a company like Facebook I think in the firing line, particularly from the left over what they perceive to be the platform's role in helping the Russians to swing the election against Hillary Clinton and for <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>But if you look on the other side, you've got Republicans who believe that these big tech companies are run by die-hard liberals who are using their power over the information that we consume and the way that people connect with each other to push an agenda of liberal values. And so I think all of these problems really are a consequence of the massive success of these companies in producing tools and products that billions of people around the world want to use.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Yes, they've all been dragged into this special counsel's investigation for allowing phony Russian sites access and taking ads from these Russians or Kremlin-linked groups. Even Google and Facebook now saying they'd be willing to take some federal regulation of online ads. But why can't they do a better job of policing their own content? Is it because they cling to this fiction that they're not really media companies when in fact they are among the most powerful media companies on earth?</p><p>HILTON: Well there are two parts I think. The first answer is there is just so much of it that the sheer scale of the content, the number of hours of content that's uploaded every second to YouTube, the amount of, you know, think about of the 2 billion people using Facebook. It's just so much that actually it's very difficult to police that or, you know, using automated means because even though we hear a lot these days about artificial intelligence and what's called machine learning and natural language processing where computers if you like try and understand the meaning of different words and trying then understand what's going on.</p><p>Actually, all that is still in its infancy and so to police the content for example, to spark terrorist plotting or child abuse, those sorts of things. Actually, it's pretty difficult.</p><p>KURTZ: I get it. I get that it's a fact of life --</p><p>HILTON: On the other hand, if you want to do this manually, it costs a huge, you know, you go to employ not just tens of thousands but hundreds of thousands of people. That would be their argument. That's just really difficult to do.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, they make lots of money. It's about money. They don't want to spend the money. I guess Facebook are now going to hire another 10,000 fact checkers. It's just interesting you talk about these companies getting badder from the left and the right. Twitter is now going to remove the blue verification for prominent people if in Twitter's judgment those people post hateful or racist messages.</p><p>When you get into hateful, you start attacking politicians, is that hateful? Could they come under fire for exercising that judgment in a way that's controversial particularly as you say these Silicon Valley companies are perceived as being run by liberals?</p><p>HILTON: Yes, it's a really big issue. And I think one of the arguments that you hear a lot from the right particularly is that there is a double standard. Their judgment, the company's judgment of what is hateful actually is driven by their politics. So for example ads that promote pro- life position are considered to be provocative, and hate speech, and you've seen that. You've seen YouTube getting into hot water over classifying conservative philosophical instruction videos as contravening their guidelines.</p><p>KURTZ: Final point, are we all partially to blame? Do we give these tech companies and these sites too much of our time, too much of our information and then we grumble about it?</p><p>HILTON: Yes, I think that is right. On the next revolution, we regularly come back to this point about the impact of technology on our humanity and it's something I feel very strongly about. I wrote a book about it. I advocate -- I don't use a smart phone for example. I haven't had a smartphone for five years and I live perfectly without it.</p><p>KURTZ: How do you survive? You live here in Silicon Valley. You don't use a smartphone. This is a revelation!</p><p>HILTON: I don't use and I haven't for five years and life goes on. It's perfectly fine. And so I'm really concerned about the way there are phones in particular have made people basically addicted to this technology. But that doesn't absolve the companies from their own responsibility whether it's in terms of their market power, their dominance over a particular market for example online advertising or their power over information.</p><p>And I think that they definitely need to take all these issues much more seriously than they have in the past. I think to be fair to them, they are realizing that now and they are starting to think much more deeply about their broadest social impact.</p><p>KURTZ: Steve, I'm sorry. I lost track of what you're saying I was just checking my feed here. Steve Hilton, thanks very much for joining us. Great to see you.</p><p>HILTON: Great to see you. Thank s Howie.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: Life goes on. Still to come, \"Newsweek\" and a new low in comparing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to the most evil people on the planet.</p><p>KURTZ: Even in the media and entertainment culture that feels free to compare to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to the worst villains in human history, this was a new low. \"Newsweek\" used this week's death of Charles Manson to compare the president to the cult leader, who happen to be a mass murderer. This utterly illogical connection rested on one psychologist who said both Trump and Manson use emotional anguish to appeal to alienated people or something.</p><p>But even the person said he wasn't comparing Trump and Manson though that did not stop \"Newsweek.\" The magazine later deleted all references to the president saying the original piece didn't meet its editorial standards which were sadly missing in action. Just pathetic.</p><p>Well that's it for this edition of Mediabuzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you're all enjoying a good Thanksgiving weekend. Check out our Facebook page.

What persuaded her to click \u2018buy\u2019, Friend said, was the short-term credit offered by Afterpay, which split the $260 payment into four interest-free instalments.   Afterpay is among a handful of alternative credit firms which offer small loans, mostly to online shoppers, and make their money by charging merchants a 4%-6% commission.   These buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firms have benefited from a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus crisis in countries including the United States, where state aid has also boosted retail sales.   \u201cI\u2019m more inclined to use them because they make it easier to afford to get the things I want all at once ... and when I want to splurge on something,\u201d Friend said of the loans.   Some investors are now betting shoppers will stay away from stores as coronavirus cases rise again in several countries around the world, boosting business for BNPL firms.   But swelling subscriber numbers may also increase bad loans, mainly among first-time users who are more likely to default.   And as job losses rise and government aid ebbs, the business model will face its first real test in a recession.   \u201cMuch still hinges on any virus second waves and government wherewithal to keep boosting demand,\u201d said Andrew Mitchell of Ophir Asset Management which owns shares in Melbourne-based Afterpay, whose market value has risen to $12.55 billion from over $100 million four years ago.   While a move to online shopping was underway before the pandemic, the shift has accelerated under lockdown and Afterpay signed up more than a million new active U.S. customers between March and early May, taking its overall base there to 9 million.   Meanwhile retailers desperate to move merchandise have also become more receptive to partnerships with BNPL firms, which unlike credit cards or mortgages, make loans instantly.   Klarna, Europe\u2019s biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20% on average globally.   With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden\u2019s Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face, Disney\u2019s streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora.   Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150% annually.   (For an interactive version, click here tmsnrt.rs/2BHL5qC )   Although fears of credit losses sparked a sector-wide sell-off in March, the entry of big tech investors and rising subscriber numbers have since supported a sharp recovery, with stocks now at record highs.  \u2018TURN OFF THE TAPS\u2019  The pandemic forced most companies to tighten their risk settings, which they say may push up loan rejection rates, although Afterpay, Klarna, Zip and Sezzle declined to provide specific numbers.   \u201cBNPL operators can turn off the taps and quickly throttle down growth if repayment risks increase,\u201d Mitchell said.   While Afterpay, with bad loans totalling 1% of its loan book as of March, changed its requirements so that customers had to pay a quarter of their loan upfront, co-founder Nick Molnar said rejection rates were roughly in line with the start of the year.   Molnar said an overwhelming majority of Afterpay customers, whose average transaction value is A$150, pay back on time, while loans on new purchases are denied to those who do not.   Although some brokerages expect Afterpay to turn a profit by 2022, rising costs to finance expansion and credit losses that eat into receivables are likely to mean BNPLs, which operate on thin margins, remain unprofitable for some time.   Klarna saw credit losses more than double in the first three months of the year to about 0.7% of underlying sales as it expanded in Europe and the United States, where regulation of the sector is almost non-existent.   Only California has said BNPL firms need a license, and fined some for lending without one.   In Australia, where the industry first took off on the back of easy funding, the corporate regulator is set to release a follow-up report this year to one it issued in 2018 raising concerns about users becoming overextended and calling for BNPLs to be regulated in line with other credit services.   Companies, investors and analysts agree that young people with stimulus money in their wallets are driving sales and BNPL shoppers that Reuters spoke to were all under 35 and bought household items, as well as skin care products and clothes.   \u201cThe vast majority of our customers have income levels of under $75,000, so I would say the majority probably have a stimulus check,\u201d said Charlie Youakim, CEO of Sezzle, one of the smaller firms.   The younger demographic is harder to assess because they lack credit history, meaning most companies use algorithms to run real-time eligibility checks and assess risk of default.   \u201cOur internal engine assesses risk taking various parameters into consideration which also will include consumer payment history, what is being purchased and is combined with varying third-party data sources and authentication solutions,\u201d Klarna spokeswoman Aoife Houlihan said.   Sydney-based Zip, with bad debts of just over 2% of receivables, said it assesses shoppers\u2019 public information and credit scores.   Around one in 100 customers is late with payments each month, spokesman Matthew Abbott said, adding that Zip recently tightened eligibility rules, leading to higher rejection rates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42529335990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-58W1-F07F-82S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank\u2019s monetary policy framework review.   The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.   To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. -Fed Chair Powell to speak on Fed\u2019s framework review next Thursday -Coronavirus legacy will be weak global inflation: economists  2/NATIONAL SERVICE  Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector\u2019s downward trend in the first quarter.   The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.   The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.   Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year\u2019s while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show. -China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013 -China\u2019s banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013  3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?  The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar\u2019s decline as the world\u2019s reserve currency.   Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.   And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar\u2019s 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold\u2019s eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.   Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs. -King dollar\u2019s decline ripples across the globe. -U.S. dollar headed lower, in retreat against the euro  4/VALUE SIRENS  Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.   Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.   A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won\u2019t touch them with a barge pole.   Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap. -LIVE MARKETS-Value sirens singing the blues -Capital exited stock markets as S&amp;P hit new record - BofA  5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE  Belarus\u2019s political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country\u2019s main economic ally.   Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s \u2018landslide\u2019 election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it\u2019s not obvious how the tensions get resolved.   For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia\u2019s currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.   Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny\u2019s allies alleging poisoning.   -Pompeo says U.S. supports international probe of Belarus election -Belarusian protesters defy Lukashenko, EU announces sanctions -ANALYSIS-Putin bets on

Ultimately the courts \u2013 including the Supreme Court \u2013 can decide only whether the Department of Justice\u2019s approach passes muster under current law,\" the statement read.</p><p>Smith underlined that despite the court's decision the majority of the work should be done by the US Congress, calling on the legislative body to adopt a law that would correspond to today's realities.</p><p>\"But while attention today will focus on the Supreme Court, we believe the most important work should take place in the Capitol building across the street, by the U.S. Congress ... The courts are not able to write a new law. Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can do that, using its tools to craft a nuanced solution that balances all the competing concerns by enacting a statute for the 21st century,\" Smith stressed.</p><p>TOUGHER PRIVACY RIGHTS PROTECTION IN EUROPE</p><p>The European Union is closely monitoring the case, since similar problems exist across across the Atlantic. In May 2018, the European Union is expected to introduce its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The new legislation will replace the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and harmonize data privacy laws across Europe to protect all EU citizens in their data privacy and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.</p><p>\"There is a huge difference between what countries can decide in joint agreements on mutual legal assistance, and criminal law for individuals, where extraterritoriality cannot just be overruled like that. Microsoft is actually followed by the Irish government, when it refuses to deliver the emails that the US justice department requests. Can you imagine any dictatorship requesting tomorrow the same sort of access to its citizens\u2019 data abroad?\" a lawyer representing a big tech company said anonymously to Sputnik.</p><p>The GDPR will be tough for companies, organizations and individuals within Europe. In particular, the new privacy rights legislation is expected to extend its territorial competence to the organizations outside the European Union that provide goods and services to data subjects in the European Union.</p><p>In addition, the GDPR will require companies to make their requests for the processing of personal data consent more informative concrete and unambiguous.</p><p>EU SEEKS ACCESS TO PRIVATE DATA STORED OUTSIDE UNION</p><p>When it comes to access to private data in the interest of the EU authorities, EU member states still want to be a able to obtain information on servers across borders. That is why the European Commission is currently preparing relevant legislation.</p><p>\"The EU executive wants law enforcement authorities to be able to access electronic evidence stored within the 28-nation bloc. This is known for a while and nothing new, there is a proposal in preparation on access to e-evidence for law enforcement (investigations and evidence within the EU). It was already discussed in the Justice council previously,\" Christian Wigand, a European Commission spokesman, told Sputnik.</p><p>The scope of the planned European legislation extends to data held elsewhere than in the European Union, which, according to experts, will be difficult to implement in reality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RNSNWS-160ROS34773540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RNSNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RS0-K521-JBN1-G31X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442979</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><timeReceived>8:25 AM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Rossiya Segodnya All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sputnik News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16346\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The bill restricts the applicability of legal liability protections for online service providers, currently found in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The legislation would only apply to the largest platforms, defined as \"edge providers\" in the bill's text.</p><p>* * *</p><p>\"This legislation is another in a long series of misguided attacks on Section 230. This time, it puts platforms on the receiving end of unending lawsuits for their moderation decisions, thereby disincentivizing any moderation at all.\"</p><p>\"The bill uses strategically vague language to attack the perceived suppression of conservative speech on the largest social media platforms. Going well beyond reasonable community guidelines, this bill introduces undefined and indeterminate concepts like 'bad faith' and 'intentionally selective enforcement' that will raise questions in the courts and trigger waves of litigation for years to come. Uncertainty about the bill will furthermore drive platforms to avoid questions and litigation by degrading moderation to allow all types of vile or objectionable content on their service, or by over-moderating content -- even of a potentially conservative nature -- such that no posts left on the service could trigger any liability on the part of the company.\"</p><p>\"Lawmakers concerned about protecting children online, preserving free speech and ensuring that social media remains open to all voices--not least of all conservatives--should instead rely on the free market, since the economy can support a virtually unlimited number of platforms, and neither they, nor anyone else, are required to use these services. The free market is vastly better than the heavy handed regulatory approach this bill proposes, which promises only to stifle speech.\"</p><p>[Category: Economics]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7150037 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7150037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605T-VP81-DYG2-R2F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"363\"/><timeReceived>6:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 20, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By using the Privacy Act of 1974 as its framework, the bill provides overdue transparency and accountability from the tech industry while ensuring that small businesses and start-ups are still able to innovate and compete in the digital marketplace. A one-pager of the bill is available here. </p><p>  \u201cThere has been a growing consensus that Congress must take action to address consumer data privacy,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHowever, I believe that any efforts to address consumer privacy must also balance the need to protect the innovative capabilities of the digital economy that have enabled new entrants and small businesses to succeed in the marketplace. That is why I am introducing the American Data Dissemination Act, which will protect small businesses and startups while ensuring that consumers are provided with overdue rights and protections. It is critical that we do not create a regulatory environment that entrenches big tech corporations. Congress must act, but it is even more important that Congress act responsibly to create a transparent, digital environment that maximizes consumer welfare over corporate welfare.\u201d   Specifically, the ADD Act would do the following:      Not later than 180 days after enactment of the ADD Act, the FTC is required to submit detailed recommendations for privacy requirements that Congress can impose on covered providers. These requirements would be substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.     Not earlier than one year after the date on which the Commission has submitted detailed recommendations (18 months after enactment), the FTC will publish and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress proposed regulations to impose privacy requirements on covered providers that are substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.     To ensure Congress acts in a timely manner, if the Congress fails to enact a law based on the recommendations provided by the date that is two years after enactment of this bill, the FTC would promulgate a final rule, not later than 27 months after the date of enactment to impose privacy requirements based on the narrow, congressionally mandated course of action created through this bill.

His book, \"The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post- Crisis World\" is available now in Paperback.  Ruchir, great to have you with us on the program.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Good to be back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Let's start in your book, you talked about the rhythm of the jungle and identifying the difference between noise and signal and where a tree might fall, et cetera.  </p><p>      The weekend with the president of the United States, where's the noise and where's the signal, Ruchir?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, I think, there's a lot of noise across the world because there's so many like elections also which took this weekend, right?  </p><p>      You know, starting from New Zealand, Germany, France, et cetera. And then, look back here, even at the United States in terms of the approval ratings.  </p><p>      And here's the sort of takeaway that I have in terms of what's happening in the world today.  </p><p>      One, it is extremely difficult to be an incumbent or a politician in power today.  </p><p>      In fact, we have data going back a few years and then our database, basically, shows that never before have leaders across the world being this unpopular.  </p><p>      So we looked at the approval ratings of leaders across the world here in democracies in particular, where we can rely on the data.  </p><p>      And we find that the approval ratings of incumbents in power today is of the lowest level since we've started keeping the data.  </p><p>      It was down about 20 percent each points compared to a decade ago, the average of approval ratings.  </p><p>      So whether it's -- call it over Trump here or even in the places where the leaders are winning the election bids.  </p><p>      In places like Germany, they're coming back with much reviews majority.  </p><p>      So that is what I think as an anti-incumbent surge across the world and the honeymoon effect is getting shorter and shorter every day with leaders that are losing their popularity very rapidly.  </p><p>      I mean, I'm pretty stunned by what's happening in France and Brazil with Macron's sort of popularity has diminished so quickly after just two to four months in power.  </p><p>      And so, I think, there's been this -- like German election, Angela Merkel sort of, you know, much reviews majority victory rather in this election.  </p><p>      It's just so difficult for an incumbent to go on today.  And remember, the Germany possibly has the best economic fundamentals of any developed countries, you know.  </p><p>      We looked at the per capita, income growth of all developed countries, Germany ranked as number one, Angela Merkel over the last decade.  And yet, she's facing enough pressures from the right -- within the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  You have described the journey then.  What's the destination here?  What's the end game?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, I think, that -- I mean, in terms of maybe anti- incumbent is sort of constant journey in terms of what's going on that, you know, when in doubt, throw the bums out.  </p><p>      I think that is the defining mantra of this era.  And, I think, that's what we should look at in terms of this constant journey, incumbent leaders just keep, you know, keep getting thrown out.  </p><p>      And Merkel has done really well by staying in power, but what worries me about Merkel is the fact that the longer the leader stays in power, the more difficult it is for the leader to remain popular.  </p><p>      I mean, that even in Germany, the person who stayed in power for even longer before her was Helmut Kohl, right?  </p><p>      But look at her, you know, like in terms of how he was treated after 16 years in power.  </p><p>      So it's just sort of very difficult time to be in power in this rather challenging global environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  I am really interested though in a relationship between businesses and leaders of a country whether or not it's the German automakers and now, what Merkel has to do to deal with the coalition here in the U.S.</p><p>      You had Trump really attacking the NFL, I feel like if NFL was a stock six months ago, it would have been tanking but today, maybe not. What's the relationship there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  No, I think, it's bound to be a bit more confrontational because, you know, I think that it's easy picking for many politicians who basically, you know, go after businesses or go after, you know, in people who are in power.  </p><p>      And, I think, that this is what to means like one of the biggest risk as global bull market as well, which is that if you look at the regulatory some building against some of the tech companies now.  </p><p>      You know, like that I think is one of the biggest sort of threats to this bull market because the leadership there has been all about tech.  </p><p>      So I do feel that this is a bigger risk which is taking place. But, of course, in Germany's case what's a lot interesting now that we have discussed a lot actually about the rise of the AfD and the populous, right?  </p><p>      But it's also interesting that a very (INAUDIBLE) within this party out there also did rather well, getting more than 10 percent of the work.  </p><p>      They've been out there like in Germany.  So, I think that it's a very complicated scenario out there, but generally, I think the people across the world are very willing to turn against the establishment at the slightest excuse.  </p><p>      And Merkel has been very good at playing those games in terms of how do you sort of, you know, just about move at the right minute to try and (INAUDIBLE) the opposition.  But even she's finding it increasingly difficult to do so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  If this anti-incumbent biased is universal around the world, it can't be a coincidence.  </p><p>      There must be some common factor or factors that driving it.  Is that a matter of growing income and wealth and equality which causes people to be dissatisfied?  </p><p>      Is that a matter of technological change, globalization?  What are the factors you see that's driving that anti-incumbent biased?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) constant, right?  In terms of rising income equality has to be one, everywhere you go, people speak about that as being a big issue.  </p><p>      But the fact that just economic growth is just so low everywhere, I think that also has to be a factor, it's just less of the (INAUDIBLE) to be sort of given.  </p><p>      And then I wonder if there's a media effect as well which is that it's source (INAUDIBLE) contagious, it spread so quickly in terms of the people the way they go after the establishment --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) Ruchir, join in, why not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  No, but at the margin, but I think that I'm really surprise to see as to how quickly the honeymoon of leaders comes to an end, you know, like 20 years ago, we've had a much longer honeymoon period.  </p><p>      And Macron in terms of the way he's been skewered by the French media in the last three months, it's something which tells you that, \"Listen, it's not even sort of (INAUDIBLE) yet and given such a back clash.\"  </p><p>      Well, I think that you are basically correct that the origins of this anti-incumbent (INAUDIBLE) which is ripping the world today is basically economic in nature and income equality has to be on the big issues behind us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, you'll be sticking with us, much more conversation on that throughout the hour.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Still with us is Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.  So, Ruchir, it seems like with the notable Central Bank of England, the central bank seemingly heading more or less in the same direction which is either backing off of the easing or actually tightening some.  Is that where they should be headed?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Yes, I think so.  Because, I think that, you know, like the big internal debate that is possibly happening at many central banks and which -- about which -- we may -- I'm not hearing that much publicly but it's showing up in the minutes.  </p><p>      And on that sort of TVs is the fact that they need to pay much more attention to financial stability, that the mandate of central banks so far has broadly mean inflation targeting.  </p><p>      And so over the last few years, you've seen this attitude that inflation is under control they can keep providing lots of stimulus and run a very easy monitory policy.  </p><p>      But now, I think, there is an increase recognition that as much as risk to the economy from asset prices sort of going up too high rather than just consuming prices going up too high.  </p><p>      And there's one step to stick out here which I keep sort of reminding people off the shore, how much the world has changed.  </p><p>      We should have 30 years ago exactly at this -- I mean, around this time, we have the 1987 stock market crash, where you have the massive decline in one day.  </p><p>      But the real economy really did not suffer much for it, right? But today, that is unlikely to happen and here's why.  </p><p>      The size of the financial economy today is 3-1/2 times the size of the underlying real economy.  30 years ago, they were nearly the same.  </p><p>      Today, the 3-1/2 times larger, so that's my entire shoe here which is that now the tail wags the dog and if you look at every single major recession that's taking place in the world over the last 20 to 30 years starting with Japan in the 1990s, East Asia in the late 1990s followed by the thick bubble going burst in the early 2000s.  </p><p>      And then, of course, the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, each one was really preceded by financial instability which is massive asset price inflation followed by asset price bust, and that having to see these consequences for the economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  When there's so much in the central banks, the western central banks have done something as financial stability by just increasing reserve requirements under regulatory issues in the banks.  </p><p>      What you're talking about as you say is bubbles bursting, what is the history, the track record that central banks in being able to take some of the air out of those bubbles without going too far?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, they haven't tried that much so far because the sort of -- the learning philosophy which is what sort of Greenspan led with was the fact that we can't support bubbles, it'll be much better at cleaning up the mess.  </p><p>      So we should (INAUDIBLE) this very (INAUDIBLE) central banks reaction which should have been bubbles are so forming, central banks really passive about it.  </p><p>      But the moment they burst, they rush out with the entire (INAUDIBLE) to try and sort of get the economies to go again.  </p><p>      So, therefore, we have seen this massive increase, I think, in the financial economy relative to the underlying economy.  </p><p>      So I think that for me, is an outdated concept.  And central banking evolves.  I mean, remember that in the 1970s the central banks never really focused that much with even inflation.  </p><p>      Inflation targeting only came as a formal mandate for the Fed in 1977.  So central bank -- central bank thinking evolves.  </p><p>      And, I think, that we have, again, on that stage with central bank thinking needs to evolve out here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So from our perspective it seemed like fiscal stimulus is like your worst-case scenario?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, in a way, because I think that we spoke -- we lead this program that we're talking about Trump sort of the tax cut plan, which is fine.  </p><p>      I mean, he wants to reform the tax code, everyone is (INAUDIBLE) but here's the problem that, you know, which I think that it need to really (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>      At this stage often, economic cycle, the United States has never run such a large fiscal deficit as it is currently doing.  </p><p>      Remember, what the classic sort of concept used to be which is that you run off to school (INAUDIBLE) in good times and you spend it in bad times.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Exactly.  But it appears that you quaint, but I think that you need to sort of keep that in mind that the fiscal deficit today in the United States is very large, at this stage of the economic cycle, it's never been this large.  </p><p>      And we just think about what will we do the next time we have an economic downturn.  And we need to reserve some bullet for that.  </p><p>      I think that that is something we should not properly sort of understood or amplified enough in this rush to do something to pass that tax reform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) kind of lose the book when the good times come.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  That's absolutely right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  And they stayed that one page which just means stimulus, stimulus --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Stimulus, stimulus, stimulus, absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  I do wonder about how you define good times?  Are these good times?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, in terms of the fact that there are good times because of what we experienced in postwar history, where we're used to global economic growth being much higher.  </p><p>      But some of us have argued that the reason that global economic growth is much lower today has to do with some factor which is outside our control and demographics.  </p><p>      To me, the single most important reason why the global economy truly is not growing as rapidly as it was for much of postwar history is because the demographics have changed.  </p><p>      Which is the world's population growth we have today is a lot lower.  Germany is a classic example of that which in fact next decade Germany's labor force is expected to shrink every single year by hundreds of thousands.  </p><p>      And so an answer to that could have been immigration but that's increasingly off the table given what's that going to the social fabric.  </p><p>      So -- but, I do feel the fact that the global economy today is growing about as fast as it possibly can.  </p><p>      This is the trend growth rates for the global economy now and to sort of think that this economy required a stimulus is a bit of a misguided step. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So with the demographics in to the political story and where we go in here.  Are we in a race for the bottom and what I mean by that if you happen an older generation and you have a demographics, so instead of demographics in the western world that increasingly get older that of a particular way, are they set to continue voting that way?  </p><p>      And therefore, does it just make the problem greater and greater until ultimately, Ruchir, they die.  Is that where it's going?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  I don't quite thought, you know, like that far out in terms of what this (INAUDIBLE) circle that you're outlining out here sort of gets too.  </p><p>      But I do feel that, you know, that this angst is likely to continue which is in fact that, you know, this whole thing that whoever is in power, the angst is just against whoever that, you know, like people are in power with the results not so good.  </p><p>      And remember the fact that they have a big anchoring biased which are the fact that the global economy today is still growing at the fastest pace that it has grown if you look at it from multi-century standpoint.  </p><p>      But because they're so used to the very rapid growth that they've got in the 1980s and 1990s, and last decade, and we think that the global economy is not doing that well.  </p><p>      So lot of anchoring biased is here in how we view the global economy and that's something which shapes in to the political discourse as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management will be staying with us.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  And still with us is Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.  That echoes what you're talking about before that if you end up having a regulatory over hang on a big tech name, thus significantly impact the outperform of the bull market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Yes, it does.  I think that, you know, for next year, there are two or three risk with this bull market.  I mean, apart from the fact that it is getting oil.  </p><p>      But we know that oil (INAUDIBLE) is not enough to sort of kill the bull market.  </p><p>      But what could the catalyst be, I think, it's worth thinking about.  So the one -- the one we spoke about the regulatory sort of overhang, you know, and those forces are building you can see sentiment turning towards sort of big tech.  </p><p>      And this argument that there's increase concentration of power among a few companies and each sector of the United States is leading to a problem and this is a global phenomenon, by the way.  </p><p>      So that's there.  But the second one is quite basic which is that every single bull market in U.S. has really has been killed by the Fed as people say.  </p><p>      I think that the thing sort of risk is building up for next year which is the QE as we have called it, and now turning in to QT next year which is like it really becomes quantitative tightening.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Quantitative tightening.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  I think that the risk from that are greatly understated which is that you have this massive expansion and multiples and cause by liquidity.  And then liquidity begins to turn, what that leads to is possibly being underestimated.  </p><p>      And it's changing the margin, remember that these people speak about how the central bank balance sheet across the world will keep increasing, you know, with ECB and Bank of Japan still doing some buying all bid, reduce space.  </p><p>      Markets really function at the second level relatively in terms of rate of change.  And that's beginning to return next year quite significantly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Where do you see that stuff?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  In terms of --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  In the market like where are you going to see that? Because if the Fed has had its way, you're going to see no volatility in the treasury markets and it's really smooth and these supplies is going to come out to be really nice and smooth.  Where do you look for that crack?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  No, in terms of the fact that like I said that the -- that if they're in a preset course, right?  And the underlying economy is still doing OK.  </p><p>      I think that by about the second quarter of next year this really, globally, begins will turn into quantitative tightening.  </p><p>      And as I said that markets don't function in a very linear way that there'll be sort of (INAUDIBLE) about it, and then all of a sudden they'll begin worrying about it and then they'll be no in to it.  </p><p>      So I think that these are sort of very binary ships which happened in markets and I think that the risk is building up next year as you begin to get quantitative tightening across central banks, that's going to happen.  </p><p>      And the other three which we haven't spoken about is China, right?  The fact is that in China to the central bank there is -- and the authority if they push the party congress, I think, are likely to step up. </p><p>      Some of their monetary tightening and deleveraging which is what it kept on hold because they want nothing to go wrong until the party congress got out of the way in mid October.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Ruchir Sharma it's great to have you with us.  Morgan Stanley Investment Management, of course, Chief Strategist is sticking with us.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management still with us.  Ruchir, we spend a little bit of time talking about technology and the regular push back.  </p><p>      What we're seeing across geographies is an approach from Europe really around the tax issues getting this big technology companies to pay more tax.  </p><p>      Here in the United States it seems to be a more ethical issue the way they control the content that is on various platforms.  </p><p>      What do you think is ultimately going to be the biggest issue for these big companies?  The European approach or the U.S. approach as it evolves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, I think, that the U.S. approach is the bigger risk here which sort of the sentiment begins to turn in to the regulatory stuff, you know, going after this big companies and these parties has already been drawn as, you know, in the -- in the -- like in the media about the fact that data is the new oil and some of the big sort of companies like Standard Oil have broken down, we need to do something with these companies.  </p><p>      So I think that they are there yet, I mean, if -- you know, I think that if you speak to people back in California and stuff all the people in government, I don't think that they are there yet which is they sort of say that (INAUDIBLE) break down.  </p><p>      But sentiment is beginning to turn and I think that the other thing we haven't spoken about is that it's quite remarkable that we find that in China there's much left of our commodity of this even though if you look at the top 10 companies in the world today, two of them are from China now in terms of largest in the world.  </p><p>      So I think that it's important to keep an eye out there that how are they sort of dealing with it.  </p><p>      I think that (INAUDIBLE) attitude is more that these companies are such big employment created at the time when the economy is sort of transitioning from an old to a new economy that they haven't seen much conversation there.  </p><p>      But that's something also they haven't seen some chatter, you know, we sort of -- there was a bit of sort of little panic a couple of months ago when one of the party official described all this online gaming as electronic heroine out there. </p><p>      So I think it's -- that this global sentiment is turning but I'm not sort of looking for anything dramatic to happen just now and as typically it happens it's after we have some crisis that's when the regulatory risk goes up the walls.  Currently, it's more chatter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  China has in many control, obviously, some of that social media platform.  And they certainly don't allow the likes of Facebook to come in to the country the way Facebook would like to be in to the country.  </p><p>      Are we going to see a model based on China here in the United States, is that where is this going where we banned the use of Winnie the Pooh on the platform --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  No, I don't believe so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) sensitivities towards a cartoon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:   No, I don't think so.  I mean, you know, in terms of -- I mean, I don't think that we are anywhere close to that.  But I think that, you know, at the Fed that it's important to keep in mind because as we're speaking with my book earlier.  </p><p>      And I remember, you know, they're writing a chapter on the good and bad billionaire, the sign of income equality and sort of saying that the billionaire's coming out the tech industry should be classified.  </p><p>      And the good billionaires because they're inspirational, they seemed to be non -- sort of nonhereditary and sort of positive consumer effect coming from them.  </p><p>      For me, it's like watching that sentiment that when you begin to classify them as bad billionaires, but I don't think we are there yet.  </p><p>      It's -- the sentiment is still largely positive, although it's building at a risk and worth keeping in mind.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  There are two very different questions here.  Are you bad as a company, misbehaving, and we have seen some evidenced of that as well with Uber and things?  </p><p>      Another one is you may be very good but you are acquiring a monopoly interest with restricted communications of information.  </p><p>      And the history in this country traditionally when that happens, the government figured out -- it figures out some way to regulate, that was the FCC with local broadcasters.  </p><p>      It was -- it was a government regulation of the telephone lines, it happens invariably and particularly that's true, Ruchir, when it starts to affect political speech, when it affects candidates in their campaigns.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Very true, but I think that this is a universal problem. It's not just over the tech industry, if you locate it across the board, every single, like almost every industry located in the United States has seen increase concentration, which is that if you look at the shares of the top three companies, it's gone up in almost, I think, the exact numbers of 80 percent of all industries.  </p><p>      It sounds very high number of that, so this is more a symptom of a superstar economy of sort of, you know, increase concentration and yet tech is at the leading edge of this because this is where the bull is taking place.  But this is the much wider problem of increase monopoly power and increase concentration across industries.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Absolutely right.  But this is not just tech, this is tech as it applies to content, our information, our opinions.  That is particularly a sensitive subject with the government around the world including the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Yes, I think -- but, you know, like look for some of the TVs here which show that are our people in (INAUDIBLE) talking that language and I think that so far I'm not hearing that.  </p><p>      So it's a -- it's a building risk but I don't see it something which is not going to happen tomorrow in terms of that this is going to sort of unravel.  </p><p>      It's going back to basics in terms of what's going to end this bull market, we're all looking for those factors now given that there's so much complacency out there such low volatility and take to the leading edge of this bull market.  </p><p>      But I still see the bigger risk comes from things like valuations compressing given them out instead of easy money which is being outdate and that's being withdrawn gradually overtime.  And the regulatory risk is definitely something which I would put as a factor out there.  </p><p>      But I think that those typically come after you have a crisis not before you have a downturn.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Well, fair point.  But let's stay on tech and take a look at Apple speaking with their clients and all the three major averages this morning down by about six percent in the last four days.  </p><p>      Straight four days down shedding nearly 50 billion in market cap. Mike Olson has an overweight rating on the stock and boosting his price target on Friday to 1.96 from 1.90.  </p><p>      And Mike joins us on the phone from Minneapolis.  Mike, why does stock decline over the last four days and why did you upgrade your price target?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OLSON (via telephone)</emphasis>:  Well, obviously, with the later launch of the iPhone X Apple has caused some degree of near term negative impact for the iPhone 8.  </p><p>      And we still think that this is going to be a long-term positive in the sense of rising ASPs in the next shift towards more iPhone X buyers. </p><p>      So, I guess, in other words I would just say there are a lot of costumers that would probably wait for iPhone X.  </p><p>      As a result, it could look as though the launch is up to a slow started, it is looking as though that's the case when in reality it's probably just a sign of next shift to higher end iPhones.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Well, fair point, so if you say, \"OK, you're not going to buy the 8 because you're going to wait for the X.\"  OK, but then you have that report from DigiTimes today saying that actually they're asking the suppliers to cut back on their iPhone X components because they kind of want to see how the launch goes.  How do you factor that in?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OLSON</emphasis>:  Well, I think that's typical Apple, their strategy has been maintained very tight inventory in the channel, they're not going to bail out a ton of extra iPhone X inventory in advance of knowing exactly how it's going to sell.  </p><p>      And I think in particular in the past, we've actually seen them come in to this launches with low inventory just to kind of maintain a buzz or some hyper on the launch.  </p><p>      So I think this is not a typical for Apple's, you know, inventory management practices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So, Mike, inventory you mentioned have always sounds like it's a good idea.  But certainly Apple is not very happy with the response they ate so far because that's what the reports are.  </p><p>      And I thought maybe they take a hit on the 8 so they could really get the X up, but now, we're told they're going to actually shift fewer Xs from the time being.  Isn't that raising some questions about how confident they are on their launch?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OLSON</emphasis>:  It could be, but we'll have to see if this, you know, I would put this in the category of kind of chatter out of Asia.  At this point, we'll have to see to what degree this is really results in concerning around iPhone X demand weakness.  </p><p>      If again, I think, it's more related to tightness in the channel line to maintain that more than any sort of concern around in demand weakness.  </p><p>      I think iPhone 8 weakness is real, but that should really only be a risk for the September quarter.  </p><p>      So we've actually moved about 500,000 iPhones out of our September quarter estimate and in to the December and March quarter as a result for that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Mike Olson, appreciate your time, sir.  Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray, thank you.  And Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley will be staying with us.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  And still with us Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.  Ruchir, I love what Alex is saying about how Europe is a crisis management institution.  </p><p>      There was rhetoric that for the first time Merkel gets to govern without a crisis.  What is the next crisis for Europe as you see it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's something with a flag which is like Italy in terms of what happens to those elections because that's clearly where the anti-European sentiment is the most.  </p><p>      It's clearly where the economic growth has been so weak in terms of the last few years.  So that's -- that has to be something on the -- on the horizon.  </p><p>      But, you know, like (INAUDIBLE) discussion about Angela Merkel in terms of the fact that he accepting that she's a remarkable leader.  </p><p>      But I think that really what sort of underestimate that she is a more brilliant politician than she is a leader of the free world so to speak, which are the fact that just look at the way in the last few years she's able to change her position as (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>      It's not as if she's sticking with some great principle, she's not (INAUDIBLE) type of leader with some very strong principles, and wants to lead the world in a particular direction.  </p><p>      She's more about the fact that a very adjoin politician which is that how do you act just in time to take the edge of the opposition and keep sort of moving ahead.  </p><p>      Now, of course, you can argue that's a very good stance to take, it's very non-ideological but she's not the classical leader and like the way that we think about it that about taking the people with her.  </p><p>      She's more like sort of fitting behind, watching about which way the wind is blowing and be able to position her way in that direction.  </p><p>      So my sense is that after this election unless she really change her attack, it just starts thinking about her legacy and the fact that this is her last term.  </p><p>      But if she really keeps thinking about her popularity which is how she is govern for the last few years, my feeling is this entire project of euro of sort of bringing Germany and France together. She's not going to read this election result as a sort of an endorsement of that.  </p><p>      So I think that is something which is we're keeping in mind that her governing principle is more about just moving in time to be at the right position rather than sort of having a very strong ideological commitment to anything from Europe to immigration.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  She's been very depth at it so far.  I think it's fair to say.  So it's not just Angela Merkel in Germany we're focused on. It's also a big week ahead for the world central banks and the legislative agenda here in the United States  </p><p>      Tomorrow, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will speak.  On Wednesday, President Trump is set to give a former tax reform outline and a healthcare vote is expected later in the week in congress.  </p><p>      We'll also be hearing from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday.  Joining us now from Cleveland is Bloomberg's Michael McKee.  </p><p>      So, Mike, that's a lot to cover.  I want you to start with Janet Yellen, you're going to be listening to her.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  Janet Yellen will be speaking her in Cleveland before the National Association for Business Economics.  A lot of people want to know what the Fed thinks is going to drive inflation higher.  </p><p>      There's a general feeling here that it is going to happen and people are not abandoning Yellen and the idea of the Phillips curve that is unemployment goes down, inflation goes up.  </p><p>      But they're wondering what's happened why is it taking so long. We heard from Bill Dudley this morning probably her closest ally on the Fed saying, \"It's going to start going up reasonably soon.\"  But we're still waiting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So as we wait, to what extent are they waiting for congress and the president and tax reform, are they just basically put that in their minds at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  You know, that's a very good question because the NABE surveyed its members, these are the economists who worked for all the biggest companies in America.  </p><p>      They surveyed their members and they found some optimism about growth of the future but allowed that predicated on the idea of tax reform and infrastructure reform.  </p><p>      Without that we sort of thread water.  Here's Ken Simonson, he's the survey director the Head of The Associated General Contractors of America.  Here's what he had to say about that.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEN SIMONSON, HEAD, ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA</emphasis>:  I would stay cautious increase that businesses do believe the economy will keep expanding.  These forecasters think that we'll see pretty steady gross domestic product growth, real GDP that is digested for inflation for little over two percent which is pretty much the range we're getting.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  So unless we can get something, guys, the NABE economist think we're stuck in this two percent range.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So what kind of thread is Janet Yellen need to -- need to sew here particularly when we don't even know who's sitting in the Fed Chair in February sort of setting stuff up for rate hikes but then also not getting too hawkish at the same time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  Yes, that's basically, all she can do at this point is emphasize the fact that the Fed wants a little more room, a little more ability to operate if something bad should happen to the economy which is not the expectation here.  </p><p>      Dudley said this morning the chances of recession in the future very small, in the near future very small.  </p><p>      But the focus is really on fiscal and that's where Donald Trump and the tax reform plan come in.  </p><p>      And whether or not, once the details are released, anybody believes that it's actually going to happen anytime soon.  </p><p>      The folks here think by the end of 2018 but, of course, so the way Washington works isn't necessarily the way things work here in Cleveland.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Ruchir, let's wrap things up the way we started noise versus signal, how helpful does that speak?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHARMA</emphasis>:  Well, I think that it's, obviously, like important to watch but I like the way that sort of economists keep saying that, you know, the relative chances of the recession in the near future and stuff.  </p><p>      I mean, as we have done work on this, how many recessions have economists been able to predict and post on his feet, exactly zero.  </p><p>      So, I think that let's sort of (INAUDIBLE) back about, you know, when people say that, \"Well, it's policy makers on stuff about no recession, et cetera, et cetera.\"  That's just the way of life.  </p><p>      The fact that next year this is going to be second longest economic expansion in history, just means we need to be more on the alert about work and under (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Ruchir Sharma, great to have you with us throughout the hour of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.  And, of course, to Bloomberg's Michael Mckee busy over the week full of Federal Reserve speakers from New York.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

She founded the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">Just Data Lab</url>, which aims to bring together activists, technologists and artists to reassess how data can be used for justice. Her latest book, Race After Technology, looks at how the design of technology can be discriminatory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     Where did the motivation to write this book come from?                      It seems like we're looking to outsource decisions to technology, on the assumption that it's going to make better decisions than us. We're seeing this in almost every arena - healthcare, education, employment, finance - and it's hard to find a context which it hasn't penetrated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Something which really sparked my interest was a series of headlines and articles I saw which were all about a phenomenon dubbed \"racist robots\". Then, as time went on, these articles and headlines became less surprised, and they started to say, of course, the robots are racist because they're designed in a society with these biases.</p><p>                     The idea that software can have prejudice embedded in it is known as algorithmic bias - how does it amplify prejudice?                      Many of these automated systems are trying to identify and predict risk. So we have to look at how risk was assessed historically - whether a bank would extend a loan to someone, or if a judge would give someone a certain sentence. The decisions of the past are the input for how we teach software to make those decisions in the future. If we live in a society where police profile black and Latinx people, that affects the police data on who is likely to be a criminal. So you'll have these <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">communities over</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">represented in the data sets</url>, which are then used to train algorithms to look for future crimes, or predict who's seen to be higher risk and lower risk.</p><p>The passing of\u00a0a\u00a0law can be\u00a0a placeholder for progress: people celebrate prematurely, even\u00a0if\u00a0not much has\u00a0changed</p><p>                     Are there other areas of society - such as housing or finance - where the use of automated systems has resulted in biased outcomes?                      Policing and the courts are getting a lot of attention, as they should. But there are other areas too, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">Amazon's own hiring algorithms</url>, which discriminated against women applicants, even though gender wasn't listed on those r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. The training set used data about who already worked at Amazon. Sometimes, the more intelligent machine learning becomes, the more discriminatory it can be - so in that case, it was able to pick up gender cues based on other aspects of those r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, like their previous education or their experience.</p><p>                     In your book, you assert that the treatment of black communities                      is an indication of what's to come for other communities more generally. How would you say this extends to technology?                      Thinking about how risk is racialised is one way into understanding how those systems can eventually be deployed against many more people, not just the initial target. This is one of the things we can see with these new digital scoring systems - these companies which don't just look at your personal riskiness, but also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">your social media</url> and the people you're connected with. If someone you know has defaulted on a loan, that can affect you. So actually, incorporating and gathering more data can be even more harmful to people's lives.</p><p>                     What role can legislation or regulation play in changing this direction?                      I'm personally a little sceptical - the passing of a law can be a placeholder for much more significant progress because people prematurely celebrate, even if not much changes. But I do increasingly think that legislation has a role to play. Even if a particular law is just a regulation in a state, or one country in Europe, it can be very effective because if these companies want to roll out technologies universally, and then they find they have to change something up for a certain jurisdiction, it can then be an obstacle. Other elements, like state-level protections for whistleblowers are vital, because there has been retaliation against workers at these tech companies. </p><p>                     Home DNA testing kits are increasingly popular, and genomics screening is more commonplace too. Are you concerned about how technologies are being used, and weaponised?                      We did an informal audit of three DNA testing companies when I was a postdoc at UCLA. The results we got back were completely different across the three companies, because of their own reference data. These companies have access to our data, which they can buy and sell to other companies, and there's really very few regulatory safeguards on how this is going to be used. The similarity between those technologies - the DNA testing kits, artificial intelligence, machine learning - is that the reference data shapes so much of the prediction. We have to question how it's put together, what individuals are being used as reference points.</p><p>                     You call these systems the new Jim Code, because of how they perpetuate inequality. How do they build on the legacy of Jim Crow?                      So the original Jim Crow was about designing racial segregation, but it was really about maintaining status hierarchies. Many people look at high levels of segregation - which does still exist - and they rarely question how it was designed, but instead put it down to the stereotypes of lazy people who don't value education, and all kinds of narratives along those lines. When we think about the new Jim Code, I'm referring to things like the investigation from ProPublica, where companies could tick boxes saying, you don't want black people to see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">the real estate where you advertise</url>, on Facebook. [Earlier this year       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">US courts ruled against</url> this and other discriminatory ad targeting.] </p><p>                     How aware do you think people are of issues around algorithmic bias, or automated systems?                      Since I started working on this book, a little over two years ago, I have seen a dramatic shift in the tone of the conversation around technology. Part of that has been spurred on by Facebook and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejustdatalab.com/\">Cambridge Analytica</url> and the US election. More and more people are realising that this idea of big tech coming to save us, it's really been dismantled. Part of it is shifting from a kind of paranoia around technology to what my activist colleagues like to say: from paranoia to power.</p><p>                     Could a more diverse workforce in Silicon Valley potentially provide a solution to these problems?                      More diversity in Silicon Valley is important, but won't automatically address algorithmic bias. Unless all those diverse people are empowered to challenge discriminatory design processes, diversity is a ruse. We need a complete overhaul of the larger accountability structures that shape tech development, and we definitely can't wait for Silicon Valley to become more diverse before implementing much stronger regulation and accountability.</p><p>                                          Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin is published by Polity Press (\u00a314.99).

That Is the Question.The answer is - no one knows. Not Big Tech. Not Jerry Seinfeld[2]. Even when we look toward the usual suspects and industry innovators for guidance and inspiration, we are met by cognitive dissonance. Google, for example, is allowing employees to work remotely until the summer of 2021, while concurrently expanding their physical footprint via the 'Google Pier' on the Far West Side of Manhattan. Compare that with Twitter's approach of allowing employees to work remotely, indefinitely - or said more directly, forever.

Examine as a case study the pros and cons of remote working over the last several months. What has worked well? What has been gained, whether it be productivity, leveraging technology, work-life balance or decreased operating expenses, and which of those gains will be incorporated into the new operating model. What has been lost - in terms of engagement, creative collisions, or culture, and how does an organization regain those virtues?And it is easy to suffer from FOMO (Fear of Missing Out, first coined by author and entrepreneur Patrick McGinnis), particularly as reports of 'back to work' abound across industries and geographies, and particularly as the labor market continues to suffer. But we would implore all businesses to take a collective deep breath - and for a brief moment - examine for themselves what the right mix is for their organization.

You get the idea.So before even considering 'how' to get back to the office - and before getting swept up in the momentum of returning - take a moment to do a bit of organizational (and real estate) soul searching.When (and If) Returning, Have a Plan.If, like the majority of companies, you are planning on returning to a physical workplace at some point and in some capacity - have a plan. Develop a plan that follows both state and local requirements, and keeps in mind regulatory recommendations, to maintain a safe workplace for all employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Return to work plans are not only essential for maintaining the health and safety of all employees, but may also be required by the state or locality in which the business operates before opening back up.For example, in New York, employers must[4] create and conspicuously post completed safety plans on site. Employers may use the New York State template[5] or may develop its own safety plan outlining how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Further, New York employers are required to train employees on how to use, clean, and discard personal protective equipment, including face coverings.California, by way of further example, has provided[6] specific requirements for both safety plans and employee training, as employees venture back to the physical office, including use of face coverings, frequent handwashing and regular disinfection, and physical distancing, where possible.With respect to training, many states require or, at a minimum, suggest that employers provide employees with information on the following: policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19; general hygiene; self-screening at home, including temperature and symptom checks; symptoms of COVID-19 and what to do if an employee or visitors becomes sick; cleaning and disinfection of the workplace; use and disposal of face covers; and social distancing.Even if not a requirement, it is certainly best practice to follow and regularly review the ever evolving guidance from the Center of Disease Control[7] ('CDC') and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration[8] ('OSHA'), in order to properly prepare the workplace as employees return. According to OSHA, when creating a workplace safety plan, employers should consider where, how, and to what sources of COVID-19 might employees be exposed and employees' individual risk factors, such as presence of a chronic medical condition. In addition, development of policies and procedures will ensure prompt identification and isolation of employees, should they become sick. Moreover, the CDC states that employers should consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks of employees prior to entrance to the building or office. Creating and implementing a plan for what employees should expect prior to entering the office, as well as what to expect once physically back in the office, will ensure that everyone has a set game plan upon arrival.The needs of each workplace will vary and workplace safety plans and training are not one-size fits all. Thus, employers should review state and local guidance for applicable requirements and review their workplace policies and procedures to ensure that everyone understands the workplace safety plan and to ensure compliance.What Do We Do Now?Taken together, our best advice - practically and existentially: don't rush in - not without a plan, at least.

Examine as a case study the pros and cons of remote working over the last several months. What has worked well?

But we would implore all businesses to take a collective deep breath - and for a brief moment - examine for themselves what the right mix is for their organization. Consider polling not just the C-suite, but as many clients are doing, also polling the workforce more broadly to take the collective temperature (really, particularly now, no pun intended) of the employee population as to what they want in terms of a return to work model. Many clients, particularly in professional services, report that they are moving towards a more flexible, agile, hybrid model - permanently, akin tothe model recently announced by JPMorgan[6]. Of course, that same model might not be right for retail or production-based organizations. It might not be the same answer for a company with an HQ in New York, versus Texas, versus California. You get the idea.So before even considering 'how' to get back to the office - and before getting swept up in the momentum of returning - take a moment to do a bit of organizational (and real estate) soul searching. When (and If) Returning, Have a Plan. If, like the majority of companies, you are planning on returning to a physical workplace at some point and in some capacity - have a plan. Develop a plan that follows both state and local requirements, and keeps in mind regulatory recommendations, to maintain a safe workplace for all employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Return to work plans are not only essential for maintaining the health and safety of all employees, but may also be required by the state or locality in which the business operates before opening back up.For example, in New York, employersmust[7]create and conspicuously post completed safety plans on site. Employers may use theNew York State template[8]or may develop its own safety plan outlining how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Further, New York employers are required to train employees on how to use, clean, and discard personal protective equipment, including face coverings.California, by way of further example, hasprovided[9]specific requirements for both safety plans and employee training, as employees venture back to the physical office, including use of face coverings, frequent handwashing and regular disinfection, and physical distancing, where possible.With respect to training, many states require or, at a minimum, suggest that employers provide employees with information on the following: policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19; general hygiene; self-screening at home, including temperature and symptom checks; symptoms of COVID-19 and what to do if an employee or visitors becomes sick; cleaning and disinfection of the workplace; use and disposal of face covers; and social distancing. Even if not a requirement, it is certainly best practice to follow and regularly review the ever evolving guidance from theCenter of Disease Control[10]('CDC') and theOccupational Safety and Health Administration[11]('OSHA'), in order to properly prepare the workplace as employees return. According to OSHA, when creating a workplace safety plan, employers should consider where, how, and to what sources of COVID-19 might employees be exposed and employees' individual risk factors, such as presence of a chronic medical condition. In addition, development of policies and procedures will ensure prompt identification and isolation of employees, should they become sick. Moreover, the CDC states that employers should consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks of employees prior to entrance to the building or office. Creating and implementing a plan for what employees should expect prior to entering the office, as well as what to expect once physically back in the office, will ensure that everyone has a set game plan upon arrival.The needs of each workplace will vary and workplace safety plans and training are not one-size fits all. Thus, employers should review state and local guidance for applicable requirements and review their workplace policies and procedures to ensure that everyone understands the workplace safety plan and to ensure compliance. What Do We Do Now? Taken together, our best advice - practically and existentially: don't rush in - not without a plan, at least.Play Video[12] 2020 Epstein Becker &amp;#38; Green, P.C.

Discussing data not as an object of transactions or an object of governance, but as a tool for governing others on a scale that rivals that of nation states with their law, seems a fitting topic for a special issue that is devoted to the legal construction of markets. Here, I argue that while it may well be the case that law constitutes markets, markets are not the only way in which economic relations may be organized, and law is not the only feasible mode of governing these relations. Central planning under socialism posed an alternative, which proved ultimately non-viable. (1) The rise of big tech companies (Big Tech) and their accumulation of vast amounts of data offers yet another possibility: the rule by data.</p><p>In his path-breaking article on the nature of the firm, published in 1937, Ronald Coase famously posed the following question: if markets are the optimal form of economic organization, why do firms exist? (2) His answer to this question was that some transactions are better governed inside hierarchically organized firms than in open markets. (3) The explanation he gave focused on the inevitable transaction costs that beset markets, where markets are defined by \"price movements [that] direct production, which is co-ordinated through a series of exchange transactions on the market.\" (4) Implied in this definition (which I will embrace for this Article) is that goods or services are traded for a unit of account, or money, and that a series of transactions reveals the prevailing market price. And as Coase added in another seminal paper on the \"problem of social costs,\" the allocation of property rights is key for market exchange. (5) Yet, as I will discuss in this Article, Big Tech has found a way to retain ownership over data even as it sells the data again and again, and on terms that Big Tech controls. Money changes hands, yet only access to data and their predictive power is granted in return. If this is a market in the original sense of the word, it is a rather peculiar one.</p><p>The Coasean framework also suggests that the enormous reduction of transaction costs would lessen the need for law. \"[I]f market transactions were costless, all that matters (questions of equity apart) is that the rights of the various parties should be well-defined and the results of legal actions easy to forecast.\" (6) In other words, even in a hypothetical world with zero transaction costs, there is still room for law to allocate the initial rights. How exactly these rights are allocated does not matter much for efficiency (in contrast to distributional effects) because zero transaction costs will ensure that these rights will eventually be allocated to whoever can make the most efficient use of them.</p><p>Today, over eighty years after Coase's 1937 article, transaction costs have arguably been brought under control. This has given us the possibility to communicate with almost anybody anywhere in the world within seconds; to conduct high frequency trading; and to surveil millions of people, second by second (7). If Coase was right that firms are primarily a product of (or response to) transaction costs, we should be witnessing the disappearance of firms and the flattening out of markets. If markets are the optimal organization of economic exchange, then this is true even if information technology also reduces intra-firm transaction costs.</p><p>Despite the fact that information technology has brought down transaction costs dramatically, it has not eliminated firms. Rather, the enormous amount of data produced by information technology has given us the rise of Big Tech-global corporate behemoths. Big Tech surveils individuals (the data producers) who use its services or have become objects of its data surveillance schemes. It harvests the data, and it turns the data into governance tools capable of predicting and shaping the behavior of individuals and groups (the data targets) in the interests of Big Tech's own clients, who purchase predictive power from it. Big Tech is not fostering efficient markets by collecting and sharing information with its customers or its clients; rather, it is inserting itself into the exchange by extracting information from consumers and selling processed information to various clients. These clients then possess sufficient predictive power to make the behavior of their customers highly predictable. Big Tech and its clients gain from this asymmetry of predictive power at the expense of the consumers.</p><p>Moreover, in the world of big data, information costs may not be zero, but they certainly approximate this lower bound. Yet, buyers and sellers do not transact on equal footing with knowledge only of their respective legal rights and some sense about how a dispute might be resolved. Instead, one of the two parties, typically the seller, is granted access to the predictive power of data that have been collected from data producers, whereas the buyer on the other end of this chain is left in the dark. In short, (close to) zero transaction costs have not eliminated firms; nor have they foregrounded legal rights and perfect forecast for all parties to a transaction. Instead, Big Tech firms have monopolized the informational content and governance power of data and monetized it by granting only selective access to it.</p><p>Indeed, although the raw data individuals produce may be non-rivalrous, Big Tech companies are transforming them such that their use becomes rivalrous. The choice between markets and firms then is not, or is not primarily, a response to transaction costs--but rather a response to the differential ability to create asymmetries of power. Coase might agree with this; after all, he realized that the problem of social costs is at least in part the result of existing power relations. However, those who cling to the Coase theorem--that is, the notion that under conditions of zero transaction costs markets allocate resources efficiently--may be less inclined to agree. (8)</p><p>Characterizing the business of Big Tech as creating asymmetries of power sheds new light on their relation to the consumers whose behavior they wish to influence. Consumers access digital platforms for a variety of purposes, and in doing so are turning themselves into unpaid data producers. For example, they may wish to purchase goods on Amazon; communicate via their Apple or Android smart phones or Gmail or Microsoft Outlook email accounts; build online social networks on Facebook and Twitter; or simply surf the web for all kinds of information on Google or Bing. (9) Consumers may have more than one platform to choose from; however, powerful network effects imply that once networks have reached a certain size, they are likely to tip, leaving the winner to take all. (10)</p><p>Entry barriers and search costs are down for all these services, but this does not mean that consumers are in fact free to choose which services they use, or which goods they buy. Big Tech has taken over the process of selecting and choosing. It shares with paying clients data about the behavior of consumers that it has collected itself, often supplemented by additional data it acquires from data brokers. Big Tech companies also occupy a dominant market position vis-a-vis their clients, who buy processed information that allows them to target consumers with ads and information to enhance the probability that their products will be purchased. In short, Big Tech uses its surveillance and power to serve two \"markets\": the market for consumers and the market for sellers.</p><p>One might compare the role of Big Tech with brokers who operate as matchmakers in commodities markets or stock exchanges, for example. (11) Unlike classical brokers, however, Big Tech does not match buyers and sellers. Instead, companies in this sector extract data from data producers without pay and build a database by cleansing, classifying, and processing the vast amounts of raw information they have harvested. Once they have refined the analytics, they then sell the predictive power of this information to their clients--the sellers of goods and services to customers, many of whom have earlier served as data producers. This is how Big Tech monetizes the information it controls. Given the vast amounts of data these companies have amassed, they face little competition.</p><p>In sum, in the world of big data controlled by Big Tech, data are not primarily objects of exchange transactions; rather, they are both the source for and the means of control by Big Tech and their clients over others: consumers of goods and services, workers, voters, members in organizations, or whatever other targets they might choose. Indeed, in this environment, the contracts between the sellers of goods and services and their customers have not been bargained for in the Coasean sense; rather, they have been preordained by an algorithm.</p><p>The remainder of this Article proceeds as follows. In Part II, I discuss the value of data, and compare data with other ordinary goods or property claims. I also discuss how the power data confer on data controllers leads away from property rights and from markets. Part III rethinks the world of data as hierarchy, not markets, and I suggest that the world of Big Tech and big data poses new and fundamental challenges to the formal equality of market participants because of their one-sided control over predictive and manipulative data power. In Part IV, I argue that there is a need for a third wave of accountability, namely accountability of the data harvesters and their clients to the data producers, many of whom are also the consumers of products and services at the other end of the data value chain. In Part V, I sketch a collective governance structure for databases, and, in Part VI, I conclude.</p><p>II THE VALUE OF DATA</p><p>Most dictionaries define data as facts, numbers, or just information that is used as the foundation for reasoning and decision-making. (12) Every person, simply by being and behaving, constantly produces raw information that can be turned into data and then organized into databases that can generate the power to predict subsequent behavior. People collect information about others and their environment, process these data, and act on the results of that information processing. Humans would not be able to function without processing information--not even on Robinson Crusoe's lonely island, where, given the absence of other human beings, there was little need for social norms or for law. Still, without observing and processing information about plants, animals, and water sources, and acting upon that information, Robinson would have perished in no time. In short, data are the stuff from which relations among human beings and between them and their environment are made. Surveilling a single individual generates data not only about her, but also about many others with whom she interacts. Controlling these data bestows enormous power on whoever can get their hands on them.</p><p>In fact, power seems a better explanation for the rise of Big Tech than the standard transaction cost arguments. It may well be that firms have an advantage over markets in terms of transaction costs in general. The rise of information technology, however, makes this argument far less compelling than it was in the 1930s, when Coase wrote his famous article. Today, controlling vast amounts of data and determining who can access them and at what price is an expression of economic power. And by making access to digital platforms contingent on individual data producers releasing their data, platform owners have effectively created a self-replenishing well for the source of their power. (13)</p><p>The worth of data does not lie in their exchange value but in the power they confer on data controllers. Data controllers harvest data from millions of often unsuspecting individuals, and process and analyze them with the goal of perfecting predictability about the future behavior of their targets. This also empowers the controllers of large datasets to make predictions at the macro-level about aggregate behavior, including GDP forecasts. The classified and processed data and their predictive power, rather than the raw information, can be monetized. Other companies are buying access to these data or to the predictive algorithms. The elimination of future uncertainty for only one of the parties to the \"transaction,\" the seller, tilts the playing field in its favor. This one-sided exploitation of data leads to the elimination of markets (as a series of exchange transactions for money that reveal value), and, in its place, rule by data.</p><p>To demonstrate this, I compare data in this Part with ordinary goods or property that can be turned into wealth generating, or capital, assets, with the right legal coding. (14) Data are often labeled the \"new oil,\" which earlier replaced gold as an important, if not the primary, source of wealth. In fact, oil was given the telling name \"black gold.\" (15) These metaphors are misleading, however, in that they treat data as just another asset that is tangible and finite, and where its value is derived from using or exchanging it. Gold has been cherished for these characteristics. It has been used for jewelry, artwork, furniture, and buildings. Moreover, gold coins have served as a means of payment (money), as a storage of value, and as a unit of account. Gold was eventually complemented by and later substituted with paper money. And, at times, gold was used to back paper money, which was used as the primary means of exchange. In this role, gold retained its image as an asset of intrinsic value: its precious material, shiny surface, and scarcity. Oil is certainly less aesthetically attractive than gold and has rarely, if ever, been used as money. Its value derives from the fact that it is a powerful source of energy for which there has been growing demand for over a century as more and more countries developed economically and relied heavily on oil to quite literally fuel their growth.</p><p>Data are different. Data are intangible, not tangible; they are ubiquitous, not scarce; they have neither use nor (much) exchange value in the form of small amounts of unprocessed, raw information. Indeed, data are rarely exchanged in markets that offer price discovery. Instead buyers have to rely on sellers' representations of the data's worth. Most of data's value is derived from economies of scale: from the sheer volume of data harvested and the capacity to process, analyze, and use them in order to induce behavior in others. What counts is neither their use nor their exchange value, but rather their predictive power. It is this power that is monetized by the data harvesters or controllers when selling access to the raw data or the results of algorithms that generate the desired predictions.</p><p>The shift from expected returns on assets to the predictive power of data to estimate consumer behavior might be interpreted as a new turn in the evolution of property rights. John Commons discovered the legal foundations of capitalism when he was on the lookout for the sources of economic value. (16) He detailed the shift from protecting property rights as use value to expected value in the case law of the U.S. Supreme Court between the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. This finding led him to the conclusion that economic value is ultimately derived from law and that law is the foundation of capitalism.</p><p>In contrast, the turn to predictive power of consumer behavior leads away from property rights and from markets. First, the predictive power of data can be generated without much help from the state in the creation and initial allocation of property rights. (17) This distinguishes data from the notion of expected returns and other intangible assets, such as intellectual property rights or financial assets, which owe their existence to law. The value of these legal constructions depends on the willingness of states to back them with their coercive powers and render them enforceable. In contrast, data controllers rely mostly on self-help by way of technological barriers to accessing their databases. To be sure, data controllers have lobbied states to protect the data they have harvested and placed on some physical device against hacking, or theft, and more recently have championed the tightening of trade secrecy law, including the addition of criminal sanctions for breach. However, Big Tech has stopped short of claiming full-throttled property rights protection from the state. Not only do tech companies not need this kind of support because they have technological means at their disposal to govern access to the data they have amassed, but they have also benefited from the ambiguity that has surrounded data ownership as they have moved to enclose and extract data from billions of individuals. In effect, Big Tech treated the data it captured as res nullius, or wild animals: things that belong to no one but can be claimed by whoever catches them first. (18)</p><p>Data are, of course, not the first or the only assets that have benefited from legal protection that was granted after the fact, or after de facto control had already been established. The French anarchist, Pierre-Joseph Prudhon, famously asserted that \"all property is theft.\" (19) There is some truth to it in that most state sanctioned property rights begin that way. Rarely, if ever, are de facto control rights altered when property rights are formalized and sanctioned by law; instead, the allocation of property rights typically entrenches de facto control rights. (20) This pattern can be observed in the enclosure of land in early modern Europe, as well as in the enclosure of intellectual property rights on a global scale. (21)</p><p>The major difference between land and oil on the one hand and data on the other is that data can be harvested, amassed, and turned into monetary assets without allocating property rights at the outset. In fact, data harvesters have exploited the legal ambiguity around data ownership, captured raw information, and claimed property rights to the aggregate databases they created. An important policy question is whether allocating property rights to individual data producers would make much of a difference. Because the value of data rests on aggregation and scaling of data and data analytics, individual data producers might not be able to take advantage of individual property rights even if the legal system assigned property rights to them.</p><p>Economic property rights theories rest on the notion of scarcity. Owners wish to capture the expected returns from an asset they own, but by the same token, they also must bear the costs of using it. Property rights are meant to ensure that owners will internalize most of the costs of using their assets. (22) A \"tragedy of the commons\" occurs whenever too many individuals can use a resource without having to account for the costs of doing so. (23) Data, however, are non-rivalrous goods and they are available in infinite amounts. The data harvesters only need to capture them. They might encounter some costs for capturing and processing data or for running algorithms through their dataset, but this has no effect on the raw data or the ability of others to use them. Not the raw data, but only the processed data and the algorithms that allow data controllers to extract predictive value from them, are rivalrous.</p><p>The limits of property rights theories in relation to data is also apparent when applying the flipside of the tragedy of the commons story: the tragedy of the anticommons. (24) As Michael Heller has explained, parsing rights to an asset into too many claims creates too many veto players, which makes it impossible to put an asset to its most efficient use. (25) There is some reason to believe that if every individual held the property rights to her own data, this might create a gridlock effect, because harvesting the data would require prior consent. In practice, this might not be much of a problem given the ease with which consent can be acquired. The European data regulation law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is a good example. It requires prior consent from individuals, or an alternative legal basis, for harvesting any personal data. (26) This requirement has been translated into an \"agree\" button for internet users to click whenever they enter a site that uses cookies and similar devices that track their behavior. As it turns out, most internet users do so without hesitation. The consent requirement is a nuisance, but it does not create gridlock.</p><p>Acquiring consent for data surveillance of real-world activities that are captured by sensors is more difficult. This is why notifying data producers that their data will be captured is often deemed sufficient, and consent is implied once notice has been given. (27) Either way, data producers cannot effectively prevent their data from being collected without their consent if collected in violation of existing regulations. They may challenge the data harvesting ex post, but this places the burden on them as well as on regulators in a world in which quintillions of data bytes are produced every day, ready to be captured. (28)</p><p>Thus, the economic case for property rights in data is not clear cut. Yet, the data harvesters have lobbied hard to obtain legal protection on par with property rights for the aggregate data they have collected. The United States enacted the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986. (29) Under this Act, hacking is treated as theft, thereby sanctioning the exclusive use rights of the data controller, whether or not such protection is warranted as a matter of economic theory or justice. (30) Similarly, in the Data Base Directive in 1996, the European Union sought to attract tech companies by granting copyright protection to original data or data on a device if the compilation of the data required substantial investments. (31) In either case, legal protection was granted to owners of physical devices that held large amounts of data--that is, to the data harvesters, not the data producers.</p><p>If economic theory fails to give guidance on allocating property rights to data, are more powerful justifications found in theories of justice? Hanoch Dagan and Avihay Dorfman have recast property rights as a human right. (32) Specifically, according to them, property rights encompass a relation between human beings, each respecting each other and his or her quest for self-authorship. (33) While this may not apply to all claims, property rights should be recognized as human rights \"to the extent that it is crucial to our self-determination and insofar as it is made equally available to us all.\" (34) This perspective creates certain demands for the property rights regime. Not just any regime will do, but only one that \"provides all individuals alike entitlement to the authority over others with respect to certain resources when, and to the extent that, this authority secures the possibility of developing their own life-plans, rather than the plans imposed on them by other persons or by society at large.\" (35)</p><p>At first glance, this framework makes a powerful case for individual property rights in data. The act of capturing data by Big Tech (or governments) gives them unchecked power to impose their economic or political preferences on the data producers. While not every data point, in isolation, that is captured raises human rights concerns, amassing enough information to constitute digital identities of individual data producers and using that information to influence their behavior to the benefit of the data controller does.</p><p>The test Dagan and Dorman propose is \"self-imposability by an end.\" (36) Applied to data this raises the question whether \"substantively free and equal\" data producers would choose to impose on themselves the obligations demanded by the data controllers. (37) In principle, the answer to this question should be a resounding \"no.\" In practice, however, individual consent is tied to services that most data producers want and for which there are increasingly few, if any, viable alternatives. (38) Individual consent by dispersed data producers who are faced with a take-it-or-leave-it option is not very meaningful, especially in a situation where they face oligopolies or even monopolies that control access to digital platforms. This hardly amounts to \"self-imposability to an end,\" which would require an agreement based on mutual respect for self-authorship, when, in fact, the very purpose of the data harvesting is to undermine self-authorship.</p><p>As discussed, property rights are a form of self-ordering given a set of legal rights that are backed by the coercive powers of a state. If self-ordering violates fundamental norms of justice, an alternative solution might be to deny legal support for certain activities. Just as legal systems prohibit the alienability of body parts, they might and perhaps should prohibit the alienability of data. This has not happened, and for the reasons given above about the ineffectiveness of property rights regimes, may not be workable. Still, some attempts have been made to rein in the use of data companies have harvested. The German antitrust authority (Bundeskartellamt), for example, ruled in early 2019 that Facebook may not combine data it obtained from various services offered by different apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. (39) Still, it will hardly take more than an amendment of the consent declaration for Big Tech to overcome these legal restrictions. This only reinforces the point that governing data in the interest of data producers cannot be accomplished with the standard legal toolkits. Vesting individual data producers with property rights to their data, whether for economic purposes or for principles of justice, does not protect individuals against the power that data harvesters exert by controlling entry to digital platforms on which more and more economic transactions and social interactions take place. Effective protection of individuals in their data would instead require a collective mechanism.</p><p>III RETHINKING THE WORLD OF DATA AS HIERARCHY, NOT MARKETS</p><p>The value of data does not depend on trade. Harvesting data occurs without exchange; it is a unilateral action that does not require the producer's consent. Indeed, it can occur without the producer even noticing it. The producer may have been put on notice in the agreement that she clicks when accessing a platform, but the act of surveillance is not felt or heard. Whereas for ordinary goods an appropriation without consent is easily qualified as theft, the data harvester is not breaching physical control over an asset. It is simply assembling data points that invariably result from even the most innocuous actions, and even inactions, that individuals take in everyday life. The imposition of consent requirements for personal data is an attempt by lawmakers to introduce an exchange element into the harvesting process. But unless harvesting without consent can be actively policed and sanctioned, and consent itself becomes more than an automatic click, the consent requirement itself is a sham.</p><p>Not only is there no market transaction at the source--that is, between the data producers and the data harvesters--but calling the other relation between data controllers and their own clients (who buy access to the data or the algorithms) a market is also a stretch of the imagination. Data harvesters extract the economic value from data not by reselling the aggregate data at a higher price, but by selling the data's predictive power. This can take the form of a simple service contract or an auction--mechanisms which, of course, are also widely used in markets in the Coasean sense. The difference is that the clients purchase this predictive power from oligopolies and have no way of discovering market prices through repeat transactions. Every data application is unique and allows the seller to set prices without a market test. Finally, in the relation between these clients, who are the sellers of goods and services, and their consumers, one might also question the existence of a market relation. Goods and services are not sold to the buyer who values them the most, but to customers whose future behavior has become most predictable to the seller.</p><p>In short, the business of data is first and foremost about control, because only control over massive amounts of data can be effectively monetized. The value of data is not revealed by the price others are willing to pay for data points or even the sum of all these data points, but by the processing and analytical capacity of the data controller. This capacity depends on scale; that is, on the volume of data already captured and on future access to data.</p><p>Given the purpose data serve in the hands of data harvesters and future users (the data controllers), data are better characterized as means for exerting control than as tradable goods. Controlling this resource and future access to it confers power over the behavior of consumers as data targets, which include data producers as well as other \"like\" individuals. The business of data is not about markets. It is about hierarchy. Going beyond Coase's theory of the firm, hierarchy is not employed to address transaction costs, but to exert control over future behavior and future economic outcomes. The data controllers use the data for their own purposes or share them with paying clients; in contrast, neither their clients' customers nor the data producers have access to these aggregate data as a means of governance. This uneven access to data as a source of wealth, as well as a means of governance, results in distributional inequities.</p><p>Markets that are unperturbed by information asymmetries or power have always been more of an ideal than a reality. Economic might and differential access to law, which function as institutionalized coercive powers, have not rendered flat markets, but rather deeply structured relations of power. Only with the help of antitrust law and mandatory disclosure requirements has the illusion of a free and efficient market--in which both sellers and buyers can rely on the price signal even when transacting with bigger or more powerful parties--been maintained.</p><p>Big Tech is distorting this less-than-perfect market even further. First, data harvesters are monetizing their access to raw information by processing these data and giving select access to them to well-paying clients. These clients use their access to the data to nudge future consumers to behave as their models predict. Neither the data harvesters nor their clients share the data or their predictive power with the customers; nor do they share any of the superior returns these data produce with the original data producers. When consumers and data producers overlap, they lose twice: first, they lose the value of their data; second, they lose their ability to choose transactions without manipulation.</p><p>This picture contrasts with modern contract theory, which holds that efficient contracting is all about two parties achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. Both parties face fundamental uncertainty, which renders their contracts incomplete, and both therefore need to find common solutions. (40) Big Tech will not conquer fundamental uncertainty entirely, but big data combined with rapidly developing analytical power can substantially reduce the scope of unknowable unknowns. In theory, big data could help both sides of a transaction by reducing uncertainty and thereby achieving optimal mutually beneficial outcomes. In practice, monopolizing data in the hands of Big Tech and its clients is key for the success of the data-driven business model. Who needs to bargain for mutually beneficial results when, for one party, the behavior of the other party is not only highly predictable, but manipulatable?</p><p>The rise of markets as a central mode for organizing economic relations is associated with the breaking down of social structures such as guilds and social classes, with their legally recognized differentiation between the nobility, peasants, and merchants. (41) Henry Maine coined the phrase \"from status to contracts\" to capture this transition. (42) It entailed the elimination of special legal regimes for different social classes, as well as the institutionalization of the state's coercive powers such that private agents could harness it for ordering their private affairs with one another. The transition from status to contract is well illustrated in the organization of the French Civil Code of 1804: its first book is devoted to persons, both natural and legal, and their role as subjects of civil legal rights; the second book covers the objects persons might own; and the third specifies the means by which objects or rights to objects can be transferred from one person to another. This is the law of obligations, or contract law. The legal organization of persons, property rights, and contracts are the foundation for markets.</p><p>The fact that not all market participants are equal has long been used to critique the ideal of free markets. Still, formal equality has been largely preserved, if only with the helping hand of the state in the form of strong antitrust and disclosure rules. I therefore suggest that the world of Big Tech and big data poses new and fundamental challenges to the formal equality of market participants because of their one-sided control over predictive and manipulative data power. This belies the illusion of formal equality and of voluntary exchange transactions worthy of their name. Most legal systems will not enforce a contract that has been entered into under duress. Using control over data to ensure that a target will enter into a transaction may not be the same as holding a gun to her head; however, it is arguably closer to it than the idea of a voluntary transaction between parties that contract to maximize their mutual benefits in the face of future uncertainty.</p><p>IV DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIES</p><p>The purpose of diagnosing a problem is to understand the root cause of a malaise and find the best remedy to treat it. Much of the literature on data to date has focused on the question of whether the market for data exhibits problems of market failure on the one hand and privacy concerns on the other. This has led researchers to inquire about the need for legally sanctioned property or privacy rights, respectively. (43) Proponents of market failure theories reason that state intervention is justified, perhaps even necessary, (only) in cases of market failure. (44) Absent any serious incentive problems that might affect the collection, aggregation, and monetization of data, there is no reason for conferring property rights on data. (45) Beyond personal data, for which a separate regime has been created, data harvesters have, and according to free marketeers should have, free rein. Further, since data harvesters are turning their freedom into something of economic value, the state should stay out and leave the evolution of this asset class and its use for exchange or other purposes to private actors. (46) Privacy advocates, for their part, have stressed the importance of privacy as a human right, a right that protects self-authorship and dignity. (47) However, as discussed earlier, the protection of privacy has been turned into a rather meaningless notice and consent ritual.</p><p>More recently, observers have shifted their attention to market dominance. The standard approach for dealing with market dominance is to subject it to the scrutiny of antitrust law. Not just any form of market dominance will suffice to justify intervention. After all, domination may result from success in the marketplace, or from features of a particular market or product that give rise to natural monopolies. In most jurisdictions, including the European Union, only the abuse of market power will be sanctioned. (48) Remedies include fines, the obligation to unbundle certain products or services, or, on occasion, the breaking up of a dominant company into separate parts. In addition, dominant players may be prevented from expanding their empire by acquiring other companies and thereby further entrenching their market dominance.</p><p>Some of the less drastic measures have already been invoked against select Big Tech companies. The European Union, for example, imposed fines on Google for abusing its market dominance by giving illegal advantage to its own shopping service. (49) In the United States, antitrust cases against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Uber are under consideration, but details have not been made public yet. (50) Amazon has been singled out as a relatively easy target for antitrust policy because of an only too obvious conflict of interests. It operates a giant digital market platform that is tied to a storage and transportation infrastructure to ensure delivery. Amazon is on its way to create a payment infrastructure as well. (51) Critically, Amazon not only operates a digital retail platform, it also offers its own products on the same platform and competes directly with its paying clients. (52) In fact, Amazon seems to have developed a pattern of developing its own product line after carefully monitoring successful retailers on its own platform, offering to buy them out, and, if they refuse, undercutting their prices and, allegedly, employing its control over the digital infrastructure that powers the marketplace to prioritize its own products. (53) To address this inherent conflict, India has prohibited digital platform providers from selling their own products on said platform. (54)</p><p>A recent report commissioned by the United Kingdom government and chaired by Jason Furman on \"unlocking digital competition\" offers several policy proposals for improving competition in digital markets. (55) The report notes that some digital marketplaces are prone to \"tipping,\" subjecting them to a winnertakes-all structure. (56) In response, the report offers preventive measures, such as enhancing individual users' \"data mobility.\" (57) If data producers had the right to easily transfer all of their data from one data platform to another (say from Facebook to Twitter, or from Google to Yahoo), this would allegedly increase competition between platform providers and might even avoid tipping altogether. (58)</p><p>Yet, data mobility at the individual level would affect competition only if consumers shifted from one platform to another in a concerted action--a move that, if coordinated, might well spark its own antitrust investigations. (59) Another problem with this solution is that it fails to address free data harvesting and usage. It is not clear, for example, whether (and, if so, how), the data producer might prevent the first digital platform from continuing to rely on his data for its analytics, or from digitally stalking him as he moves to a different platform. From the perspective of individual data producers, it does not really make much of a difference who harvests and controls the data; what matters is harvesting and controlling the data itself. In addition, a consumer who is the target of the data's predictive power does not necessarily benefit from greater competition among data controllers. Either way, consumers will be shortchanged. (60)</p><p>The same indifference to the problem of data domination and rule by algorithms can be found in the \"Utah Statement,\" a joint recommendation by antitrust academics and other experts who are calling for a more robust antimonopoly regime for Big Tech. (61) They seek to reverse several important doctrinal shifts over the past few decades. Their recommendations include, among others, a call for overturning legal doctrines that hinder the sanctioning Big Tech, OneZero (Nov. 18, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-utah-statement-reviving\">https://onezero.medium.com/the-utah-statement-reviving</url> antimonopoly-traditions-for-the-era-of-big-tech-e6bel98012d7 [<url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/B4AU-D4AE\">https://perma.cc/B4AU-D4AE</url>]. of monopolies, such as the presumption of a public benefit for vertical mergers, (62) and for reviving doctrines that require dominant players to offer their services to anybody, such as the structural presumption in merger reviews or the structural facilities doctrine. (63) Like the Furman report sponsored by the United Kingdom government, (64) the Utah Statement tackles Big Tech as a problem of market dominance that is in principle susceptible to antitrust policies.</p><p>While the concentration of large amounts of data in the hands of very few companies exacerbates this problem, even smaller players can engage in datasourced governance that reduces real choice on the part of consumers and thereby contributes to the marginalization of markets. Preventing Big Tech from expanding and from combining data sourced from different platforms is, of course, important, but it will not be a game changer for the practice of harvesting consumer data and turning data into lucrative tools of governance over consumers.</p><p>The real threat that emanates from Big Tech using big data is not just market dominance. Rather, it is the power to transform free contracting and markets into a controlled space that gives a huge advantage to sellers over buyers. Only the sellers get to employ the predictive power of data to their advantage against their own customers, who are often also the data producers. If data harvesting hurts as much as paying one's taxes does, it would not take long for the slogan \"no taxation without representation\" to be translated into the information age as \"no data harvesting without participation.\" Unfortunately, the act of data harvesting has little impact; consumers do not feel it and they often obtain access to something that they want in return. But this should not distract from the fact that the problem is not market dominance but power, and that the remedy therefore should be accountability, not just market structure or antitrust law.</p><p>Nobody questions that the massive data sweeps by government agencies are matters of power and therefore of accountability. And nobody would suggest that we should alleviate concerns about accountability by empowering more government agencies to follow suit and sweep their own data. Nor would anyone be satisfied if obtaining consent to access individual data was conditioned on the threat to withhold government service unless consent was given. Such solutions equally miss the point when applied to Big Tech. Instead, what is needed is accountability of the data harvesters and controllers to the data producers, many of whom also serve as the targeted customers.</p><p>In calling for accountability, one should distinguish between at least two types: first, accountability for data harvesting itself, as well as data analyses that might hardwire existing social biases. Many cited examples include the failure of facial recognition software to properly identify minorities or females. As Frank Pasquale has noted, this kind of accountability takes data harvesting and the use of algorithms to affect social outcomes as a given. It only addresses certain aspects of their use. (65) Furthermore, there is what Pasquale calls the \"second wave of accountability\" that addresses the more fundamental questions about when and for what purposes digital empires should be built. (66) This second wave seems to have helped slow down (at least the visible parts of) the development of artificial intelligence and has further advanced the inclusiveness of digital technology, especially with regards to disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The argument advanced in this Article suggests that there is need for a third wave of accountability, namely accountability of the data harvesters and their clients to the data producers, many of whom are also the consumers of products and services at the other end of the data value chain. The importance of this third wave of accountability follows from the fundamental questions that second wavers have asked but have not fully answered: when and for what purposes shall the power of data be deployed? Neither transparency of algorithms nor greater inclusion address these questions. As elaborated in the following Part, what is needed is a governance regime that ensures that data producers have a share in the economic benefits of their data and some say in the data's future use.</p><p>V HOLDING BIG DATA ACCOUNTABLE</p><p>The question about when, and for what purposes, big data shall be amassed is inextricably tied to the question of who gets to decide when, and for what purposes, data is amassed. If data were like ordinary goods and services, the answer to this question would follow from who holds property rights to data. That person can determine how to use the data, whether or when to alienate the data, or even whether or when to destroy the data. If individual data producers held property rights, they could freely transfer them to the data controllers, subject to any conditions the producers might impose. If, however, allocating property rights to raw information is difficult or creates too high transaction costs, the data harvesters can claim property rights to the aggregate data they have amassed--either by claiming capture of a res nullius or by invoking property rights protection of data on devices they own.</p><p>The difficulty of protecting raw data as property lies in the fact that it is next to impossible to exclude data scavengers from access to data in their raw form. Legal restrictions have been imposed on \"personal\" data in some jurisdictions, but even these restrictions are weak; simple consent legalizes access and any \"legitimate\" use beyond the one that has been explicitly consented to is deemed legal as well. (67) The burden for challenging the legitimacy falls squarely on the data producers, who face substantial costs and uncertainties in proving their claims.</p><p>As a result, the question as to whether data shall be amassed at all and for what purpose falls to the data harvesters, both de facto and arguably even de jure. Some digital platform operators have imposed voluntary restrictions on themselves about the kind of data they will harvest and for what uses. In theory, this should allow data producers to select from among different providers and shun the most aggressive data harvesters among them. This, however, assumes that data producers have full knowledge about how their data will be used by different harvesters, and also that the services these harvesters offer are largely equivalent, neither of which can be taken for granted.</p><p>In fact, leaving the decision to individual data producers makes little sense. They are dispersed and cannot easily exclude others from their data, not even by foregoing online services altogether, since their behavior might be detected by sensors others have installed. Data producers are facing a problem of a mismatch of scale. Each data producer is better off trading her data in return for access to a digital platform or service; yet, all data producers would be better off if they collectively set the terms for harvesting their data and for the data's future use.</p><p>The raw data might also be characterized as public goods, at least in some respects: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, which defies their status as private goods. (68) Yet, unlike standard public goods, such as public safety, the major problem is not \"free riding,\" that is, failure to pay one's due share for a good that is provided for everyone. Rather, the problem is the unhindered and free appropriation of raw data by Big Tech and their transformation into monetizable assets followed by technological and legal enclosure. As selfanointed owners, Big Tech will now determine to what ends aggregate data shall be used, by whom, and for what purposes. If data producers themselves wish to have a say, they need to create a collective governance structure that prevents the appropriation of their data. In the alternative, they should at least get a fair share of the future cash flow that the database generates and a say in the purposes for which data will be used.</p><p>Attempts to prevent the harvesting of data, including restrictions on the kinds of data that may be harvested, are likely to be futile for the reasons already discussed. This leaves rights to the database itself as the target for a collective governance regime. Below I sketch such a structure; working out the details requires further research.</p><p>First, data producers should be given a claim to the economic returns not on their individual data, but on the database in a prorated fashion. Allocating individual data producers property rights over their raw information so that they can sell them would give them only a pittance. The U.S. Supreme Court recently raised the question whether data producers have standing to bring a suit against a Big Tech company (Google, in this case) under the Stored Communications Act. (69) Standing requires specific, or concrete, injury. In a case in which the original data a person had produced were passed on to another server without permission, concrete injury required careful examination. (70) The same argument could be applied to the data harvesting process itself.</p><p>Instead of seeking to control the use of data ex post through tort actions, treating data producers as co-owners of the database would give them a claim to future profits the database produces on a pro rata basis as well as governance over its use. Just as shareholders pool their resources to invest in the expectation of future returns, so would data producers be treated as joint-venturers who could generate higher returns by pooling their resources. The Big Tech companies would be treated as agents. They may be owed compensation for harvesting, cleansing, and processing the data, but not the exclusive right to monetize the returns on these data. Importantly, as agents, they would also owe fiduciary duties to the data owners, the ultimate owners of the database. In this role, the data producers could also control both the harvesting and use of the data.</p><p>Technically, this solution could be implemented by creating a trust fund that owns the data. A possible model is the Depository Trust Company (DTC), which was created by an act of the U.S. Congress and operates as the formal owner of shares in publicly listed companies. (71) It holds these shares on behalf of the ultimate beneficial owners. The DTC was established in 1968 to reduce transaction costs in an age when every transaction in shares, bonds, and other securities left a lengthy paper trail. (72) As markets grew, the New York Stock Exchange suffered a heart-attack, which prompted the U.S. Congress to establish the DTC. (73)</p><p>The DTC's basic model could be repurposed for data: the interests in data could be transferred to a (public) trust. This trust would have a right to a share in the earnings the company derived from the data and would have the task of channeling these earnings to the data producers. The trust would also exercise voting rights on behalf of the data producers. A separate trust might be established for each major company, or possibly one for all combined. The latter would have the advantage of economies of scale with regards to the operation costs of the trust, but also in terms of the bargaining power vis-a-vis individual data harvesters. However, there are also reasons to believe that tailoring trust companies to each harvester might enhance monitoring and might better reflect the specific interests of data producers in different firms. Either way, the qualifications of the trustees, their appointment and dismissal, as well as their independence from the shareholders, directors, and officers of the data harvesters, would have to be carefully regulated and fortified with liability rules. (74)</p><p>Implementing these ideas would hardly go unchallenged. Big Tech companies and their existing shareholders will claim that a law that would turn data producers into equity holders would amount to expropriation. Yet, whether or not Big Tech companies actually own the raw data they have harvested remains ambiguous. So far, this has worked in favor of Big Tech companies, which have proceeded to harvest data without asking for consent or offering a consideration of equal value in return. They might invoke the Roman law principle that assets that are not owned by anyone can be captured and that the act of capture creates private property rights in a res nullius. But not everything that is not owned by someone can be appropriated. Roman law distinguished between res nullius and res communis, the latter encompassing assets, which according to the collective will, shall not be privately appropriated. (75) Legal intervention that clarifies the status of data as res communis and allocates claims to future cash flows the aggregate databases generate, as well as the right to decide their use, to data producers is an act of allocating the initial property rights, not an act of expropriation. And the power to allocate these rights is a matter for legislatures, not for private data appropriators to decide.</p><p>How to ensure that this fix survives future change is yet a different matter. As the history of corporate law suggests, tying the legislature to the mast is not easy. Just as the DTC, this new Data Trust would have to be introduced by federal law to eliminate the threat that regulatory competition between the states could quickly erode its efficacy. In addition, techniques that have been used in other contexts might be employed to protect data producers, such as grandfathering their rights and thereby immunizing them against future legislative change. Only databases that are created anew from future data would side-step the original constraints. Given the importance of scale for the value of databases, attempts to sidestep these constraints may not be productive.</p><p>Lastly, the new Data Trust must have effective control rights over data harvesters, which may be difficult given the existing control structure of several Big Tech companies. Facebook, Google, and Amazon all have chosen governance structures that perpetuate the founders or owners in office irrespective of any change in the future composition of shareholders or their desire to put new management in their place. They have created dual-class ownership structures that allocate to the founder(s) multiple voting rights or transfer a significant number of shares to a foundation, which the founder controls. As a result, Mark Zuckerberg controls close to 58 percent of the votes in Facebook, (76) and the founders of Google control over 50 percent of the votes in Alphabet, Google's holding company. (77) Big Tech still lives off the image of the gig economy, in which individual talent counts and anything is possible, but the founders of these companies have walled themselves in behind legal protections and can thwart any proxy fight or takeover attempt, the means for changing control over a corporation. Far from subjecting themselves to shareholder democracy, they have created a governance structure that resembles autocracies. Still, if all data producers obtained common stock in return for the data they produced, this could potentially dwarf the voting control the founding shareholders of these companies have given themselves.</p><p>VI CONCLUSION</p><p>This Article identifies a puzzle concerning markets in the age of information capitalism. According to Ronald Coase, in a world with zero or close to zero information costs, there should be no firms; instead markets should reign freely. (78) This follows from his argument that firms emerge (only) in response to transaction costs; when information is abundant they should therefore not exist. Yet, the age of information technology, and the dramatic lowering of information costs that has gone along with it, has not seen the flattening of hierarchies into markets, but instead the rise of Big Tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and others. These companies have taken command over data that individuals leave as they make use of Big Tech's services or are captured by sensors that are installed in more and more devices. Big Tech has been able to monetize its control over these data by erecting technological barriers around the data and selling their predictive power to well-paying clients.</p><p>Hierarchy, it turns out, not only reduces the costs of doing business inside the firm, it also creates a comparative advantage in securing dominance in the \"real\" world, where, according to economic theory, in the absence of transaction costs, markets should reign. The first-mover advantage of Big Tech has come at the expense of data producers as well as the final consumers, and to some extent even of the clients Big Tech services. Data producers have been unable to mount an effective counter-offensive and secure broad access to data because they are hampered by collective action problems. And Big Tech clients have been coopted into a scheme that is costly for them, but allows them to acquire dominance over both data producers and consumers.</p><p>This analysis renders important insights for the relation of both markets and hierarchy to law. Markets, it turns out, are not the natural default mode of economic ordering when transaction costs approximate zero. They emerge only if all market participants have equal access to information. When some actors can monopolize access to information (raw data) and the predictive powers of processed data, hierarchy, rather than markets, will dominate.</p><p>Moreover, law privileges hierarchy over markets. It is not a coincidence that Big Tech companies are all organized as corporations, with their hierarchical governance structure and built-in legal privileges such as limited liability for shareholders and protection of the corporations from claims on their assets by their own shareholders or their personal creditors. These features have allowed Big Tech companies to raise capital in the early stages of their operation when they still depended on outside capital and to incubate the returns they made behind a corporate veil. (79)</p><p>Given that both markets and firms are legal constructs, and that information costs alone cannot explain when one prevails over the other, what or who determines when either markets or firms shall reign? The case of Big Tech suggests that private agents will often prefer hierarchy over markets, because it greatly increases their control rights and creates economies of scale from which they can benefit disproportionately, especially when they have free rein to design the governance structure of these firms. If hierarchy is the \"natural\" outcome, proactive intervention is needed to recreate the resemblance of markets in which parties can bargain at least on formally equal footing.</p><p>Viewed in this light, the rise of private entities that monopolized data and monetized their predictive power can be described as a massive governance failure: a failure by the state to intervene in a timely fashion to protect data from private appropriation by declaring them a res communis. (80) This governance failure is difficult to rectify ex post. Still, the legal grey zone in which data still reside offers an opportunity to reassert collective rights over them. Contract law and antitrust law are unlikely to accomplish this re-ordering on their own. The antidote to the dominance by Big Tech can be found only in organizational law, in the legal tools for governing firms, not markets.</p><p>KATHARINA PISTOR, Edwin B.

As delivered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We all see the enormous violations of international humanitarian law in conflicts around the world, and particularly recently in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, and many other places. And it is difficult not to ask the question such as the question we are asking today: Is this law still relevant? Has it a future?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While I'm convinced of the enormous value of international humanitarian law, we can never take this relevance for granted. To remain relevant and useful, the law needs debate, discussions, critical review, assessment of its implementation, gap analysis, follow-through with the actors on the ground. So relevance is not a given; relevance is something which comes from deep engagement for the law.</p><p>International humanitarian law is a living body of law. Sometimes we forget it. We treat it as a static monument. It's a living body of law. It was developed with militaries for the application in the battlefield to balance military objectives with humanitarian imperatives. The intention was never to have these words stay in dusty legal books, but for the law to provide guidance on the gritty realities of war. Today our collective challenge is to find ways to ensure greater respect for the law within the changing dynamics of conflicts.</p><p>So let me just make a first point with regard to what we mean when we speak of international humanitarian law. And I don't want to offend anybody here. Probably everybody knows what international humanitarian law is. Nevertheless, from experience that in many places I go I am confronted with quite different interpretations for what international humanitarian law is, so I wanted first to say a few things on what we think we talk about when we talk about international humanitarian law.</p><p>International humanitarian law provides a minimum consensus amongst belligerents to maintain humanity even in the height of hostilities and to contain the negative impact of armed conflict on individuals, societies, and states. The Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols are to a large extent customary law reflected in well-established practice throughout time and space. It's not just something which was invented in 1949; it's a century old through time and space elaborated practice.</p><p>The Lieber Code, which set out rules of the humane treatment of civilian populations during the American Civil War, may be familiar to many of you and is an important precursor of international humanitarian law enshrined in the Geneva Conventions. The U.S. has substantively contributed to the development of international humanitarian law over the last 200 years, and today the U.S. is a strong supporter for ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law through extremely elaborate guidance to its troops in the battlefield.</p><p>In a welcome move just this week, I was pleased to hear that Senators Cory Booker and Todd Young will introduce a bipartisan resolution to acknowledge the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and call for greater respect for international humanitarian law. I commend this leadership coming from the Senate to bring attention to global humanitarian crises and promote U.S. leadership to reduce suffering of people caught up in conflict.</p><p>Built on the realities of conflict, the rules of IHL are not ambiguous. They dictate that military action must be limited by the principles of proportionality, distinction, and precaution. They prohibit the use of indiscriminate weapons, such as biological and chemical weapons that could never be used in accordance of these principles. IHL prohibits torture and other forms of ill-treatment, like rape and sexual violence. It protects those not participating in hostilities as well as provides special protection for health services and health workers. It protects those living under occupation, those in detention, the missing, and it prioritizes restoring family links.</p><p>IHL also stresses the importance of neutral, impartial, independent organizations to have access to people in need, the right for these organizations to offer aid, and the obligation of states to facilitate such services.</p><p>The ICRC, with more than 150 years of field experience, has been instrumental in shaping legal frameworks and policy recommendations that are rooted both in the reality of the battlefields and the humanitarian needs of populations. The principles of neutrality, independence, and impartiality, along with our practice of engaging with all sides in theaters of conflict and war, are key to our ability to operate. Our practice of confidentiality and our role as a neutral intermediary between warring sides, to build trust and help carve out a space for front-line negotiations, is at the core of what we are doing in so many conflicts around the world.</p><p>When I look across the globe at trends influencing conflicts and violence around the world, I observe a couple of factors which today are of particular preoccupation to us:</p><p>One, accentuated levels of power competition at global and regional level. I mentioned earlier that at the basis of international humanitarian law is the consensus of belligerents to the normative framework of this law. But with power competition we have increasing difficulties to establish that communality which is at the basis of implementation and respect for international humanitarian law.</p><p>Two, the fragmentation of actors and landscapes is a big preoccupation in today's world, not only horizontal fragmentation - the numbers of armed groups and armed actors that we find in specific battlefields - but also vertical fragmentation where the actors on the ground are dependent in the way they conduct hostilities, detain people, and operate or respect, or disrespect, from other actors at national, regional, and global level. So we are not only in a situation of independently operating and fragmented landscape in battlefields, but also in horizontal vertical fragmentation.</p><p>Thirdly, greater complexity in the patterns of violence preoccupy us whether military, counterterrorism, criminal, or inter-community violence, which are superposing themselves in some of the concrete contexts in which we operate. We see blurring contours in the battlefields because all these origins of violent actions happen at the same time, in the same place, in the same space.</p><p>In response, we must navigate between legal systems. We can't anymore focus exclusively on international humanitarian law, because we are not anymore exclusively in a clearly defined space of either internal or international armed conflict. We have to, therefore, also expand on international human rights law, criminal law, national legislation, or counterterrorism legislation amongst others.</p><p>Fourthly, wars increasingly involve partners and allies who are outside of the theater of conflict. Our contemporary experience shows how this can lead to the dilution of responsibility, the fragmentation of chains of command, and an unchecked flow of weapons.</p><p>Fifthly, battlefields are now occurring in cyberspace. And advancing technology, including robotics and artificial intelligence, means more sophisticated weaponry. Big tech, alongside States, have become important interlocutors of ours to understand those dynamics of an expanding battlefield into the cyberspace and modernization of weapons along artificially intelligent technologies.</p><p>And finally, with the absence of political solutions in most of the conflicts in which we operate, in the big theaters of conflicts in which we operate, wars today are protracted, some lasting for years or decades. Our average presence in the 15 largest contexts of ICRC operations is more than 30 years, so we are there for the long haul. Wars have become more urbanized and they are fought in densely populated areas, causing deaths and injury to many civilians, and destroy whole water, health, and electricity systems. We are not confronted anymore just with impact on individuals; we are confronted today in many of the theaters of conflict with systemic impacts on delivery of social systems overall.</p><p>The ICRC watches these dynamics to understand the humanitarian impact on the lives of millions of people living under the shadow of conflict and violence. We watch for the violations, but also we see the hundreds and thousands of situations where the law is respected. For example, when a wounded person is allowed through a checkpoint, when a child on the frontlines receives food and other humanitarian aid, when the conditions of detainees are improved or when they can receive contact with their families, we know that international humanitarian law is also respected.</p><p>It is clear to us that when IHL is respected harm to civilians is reduced and reconciliation of societies is more likely to succeed in the aftermath. I am always struck when I look at statistics. Again, when I go back to the 15 largest operations in which ICRC is active at the present moment and where we see the most systematic violations of international humanitarian law, these 15 contexts today are at the origin of more than 80 percent of the displacement of populations worldwide. We are not talking about a global disrespect and pattern of disrespect. We have specific places which are of particular concern.</p><p>IHL is not an abstract norm, as I have mentioned, but a practical tool in the interest of all to protect lives, and to break the vicious cycle of violence, and to minimize the cost of conflict. I think in the interest of reducing the bill of humanitarian assistance, which we have seen skyrocketing over the last couple of years, international humanitarian law is not only an imperative of ethics and law, it's also good, reasonable and reasonable policy to engage in in order to reduce the impact of war and violence on people.</p><p>Political decisions and military conduct can protect and support civilians and humanitarian norms or they can destroy them. They can help or they can hinder. In this context, I wanted to mention that humanitarian organizations like the ICRC are continuously navigating dilemmas between principles, law, and pragmatism; between being an advocate for a victim and a credible interlocutor for belligerents, which are at the origin of the violations of the law. We navigate constantly those dilemmas, and we are therefore aware of the narratives which challenge the acceptance of humanitarian norms or the law and the restrictions placed on impartial humanitarian action.</p><p>More than once, when we engage with belligerents, we are confronted with responses like: 'We know what the law is. You don't have to tell us. But we will respect it only if the only side respect it.'</p><p>So we are in transactional mode in many of the situations and not in normative compliance. And this is a big challenge. We see also exceptionalist arguments with belligerents, which are a preoccupation to us. Exceptionalist arguments, which says the adversary is so bad that it has he has to be fought outside of the limiting framework of the use of force. This is, in many respects, the narratives we are confronted with.</p><p>We are increasingly find ourselves at risk of being politicized, faced with security challenges that prevent access, or walls of bureaucracy, which prevent humanitarian actions. These are some of the real challenges we are confronted with, and it has been mentioned beforehand, we are exposed, therefore, increasingly, to security risks because we have difficulties in these situations always to be perceived as the neutral and impartial actor that we want to be.</p><p>In this environment, we return to the law, to principles, and to overall mandate to find hopefully pragmatic solutions for populations affected by violence and conflict. We are also refocusing our efforts to prevent violations from occurring. We are intensifying negotiations with belligerents for greater respect of rules. We work bilaterally and work in smaller multilateral cycles and circles by speaking to those involved in partnered operations, reminding them to positively influence their respective allies.</p><p>With a sharp increase in nonstate armed groups, we are growing our expertise and pattern of influence on these groups and including peer-to-peer and value-based drivers of influence. We have learned, for instance, that structured armed forces need to be approached in a different way that nonstate armed groups. And we have refined and reshaped and multiplied the different forms of engagement, whether we talk to hierarchical groups and armed forces or whether we talk to nonstate armed groups.</p><p>To conclude, dear colleagues, for many decades international humanitarian law and humanitarian action has been the domain of military and humanitarian experts. In recent years, humanitarian issues are increasingly at the core of political agendas. It is vital, therefore, that the humanitarian perspective is systematically brought into the policy debate, and that humanitarian actors are cognizant of the political discussions. And it is a difficult balance to find today that on the one side we want to prevent the politization of the humanitarian space, but on the other hand we need responsible political actors to support neutral and impartial humanitarian assistance.</p><p>And this is a big balance that we are navigating. In order to keep international humanitarian law relevant, we cannot just preach implementation and complain about violations or state irrelevance. But it is clear that we need to build and to concretize how security and sovereignty are not incompatible with international humanitarian law and humanitarian action. We need to identify the pressure points which allow us to work within the framework of sovereign states who are at the end of the day giving us a license to operate or not.</p><p>It is key that political agendas, like fighting terrorism, can be brought in line with international humanitarian law and principles. And we have to find practical solutions where the inter and conflicting relationship between those two policies which have, each one, its legitimate objectives are intersecting and causing problems to one or the other. We need balances to be found between the protection of civilian and the pursuit of military action, which respects international law, allow hostilities to be waged while protecting civilian lives.</p><p>The focus on violations and accountability is important, but the daily implementation of IHL in the field is overlooked very often. And we have also to build on positive examples of respect. But while there is broad support for arms controls and arms treaties and disarmament treaties, arms continue to flow at record levels. We have, therefore, to increase efforts of engagement to respect limitations and more stringent regulations of arms exports legislations.</p><p>This year, on the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, we take stock and we reflect. The Conventions were indeed made for all of us in the name of humanity. They are a handbrake on our worst impulses. The Conventions are still fit for purpose in many respects. Despite a shaky multilateral system, we see positive political signs of support for international humanitarian law. We see it in the strong statements such as the one before the Senate that I have mentioned. We see it on the call by G7 foreign ministers for greater respect and protection of civilians. We see it when we see advocates for IHL, which are sorely needed but do take the stage. And we see the importance of words backed by concrete actions. If we are truly to provide hope for those living in the horrors of the wars of today, we need stronger engagements we need stronger humanitarian engagement, but also academic and political engagement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122922552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3V-T7G1-JCBF-S0PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Hackers and other researchers have been finding flaws with increasing frequency, and saboteurs are exploiting those flaws by designing viruses, worms and other programs at ever faster rates.</p><p>That's why most security researchers agree not to publicize the holes they find until target software makers come up with patches and distribute them to customers.</p><p>Now some of the biggest names in technology are trying to formalize the process by crafting guidelines to govern when security holes are disclosed and the corresponding patches are released. Working under the auspices of the Organization for Internet Security, Microsoft, Symantec, Oracle Corp.and other companies are hammering out rules they hope will pressure bug finders not to publicize their findings until it is deemed safe for them to do so.</p><p>\"We think it will improve the situation,\" said Scott Culp, senior security strategist for Microsoft.</p><p>The guidelines, which don't have the force of law, lay out nearly a hundred steps for what a person should -- and shouldn't -- do after finding a hole. They also govern the appropriate responses for the company that wrote the faulty software.</p><p>At first, the plan says, a hacker should notify the software maker and refrain from publicizing the vulnerability. The software company, in return, is supposed to keep the hacker informed as it conducts tests and develops a patch, a process that should take about a month.</p><p>Then another month is supposed to elapse before the hacker may broadcast details about the problem he or she found.</p><p>If no software patch can be developed, according to the Organization for Internet Security, those details should never be released.</p><p>So far, the guidelines have won over few hackers who work for small companies or on their own.</p><p>\"It's retarded,\" said Dave Aitel, a respected hacker and veteran of the National Security Agency.</p><p>Aitel and others complain that companies will falsely claim they can't construct a patch, leaving hackers no opportunity to publicize the flaws they find.</p><p>\"The only people who will benefit ... are the vendors, the criminals and\" malicious hackers, Eric Raymond, a leading technical author, wrote to the Internet security group.</p><p>If a patch does come out, experts fear, talented virus writers will study it and work backward to find the underlying problem. Then they'll write a malicious program to exploit it, as they did with the Blaster worm this summer.</p><p>Meanwhile, many systems administrators will be reluctant to install the patch for the month before they know the underlying problem, since many patches turn out to have bugs themselves.</p><p>\"The net result is that attackers will have a head start,\" said Byrne Ghavalas, a researcher with Network Security Consulting Services in Reading, England.</p><p>Still, big tech companies feel they have to do something. They fear Congress will pass laws holding them responsible when hackers breach the software they create, an approach being advocated by the National Academy of Sciences. Rep. Adam Putnam (R-Fla.), chairman of a House subcommittee on information technology, recently warned that the next time a major Internet virus strikes, Congress will be under extreme pressure to do something dramatic.</p><p>In the meantime, lawsuits and threats of legal action are piling up. A Los Angeles woman is seeking class-action status for her 2-month-old suit against Microsoft, arguing that it ran afoul of a new California law requiring companies to let customers know when hackers gain access to personal information.</p><p>More commonly, software companies are threatening to sue hackers who expose holes in their products. Hewlett-Packard Co., SunnComm Technologies Inc. and GameSpy Industries Inc. all have issued threats under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 5-year-old law that prohibits distribution of some software code based on reverse-engineering. HP and SunnComm withdrew their threats after an outcry from security experts; GameSpy succeeded this month in forcing an Italian researcher to delete references to GameSpy bugs from his Web site.</p><p>\"This is a battlefield,\" said Jennifer Granick, a cyber law specialist at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society.</p><p>In response, some hackers are trying to pool their resources by creating a trade group.</p><p>Thor Larholm, a 23-year-old researcher at security consulting firm PivX Solutions of Newport Beach, said his as-yet-unnamed group would have as many as 800 members when it is announced around the end of the year. Their top priority is to fight the guidelines from the Organization for Internet Security, and they might lobby Congress on related issues as well.</p><p>Larholm said that if the OIS rules were enshrined in law, they would threaten the livelihoods of some hackers who make a legitimate living finding security holes and then helping to fix them.</p><p>\"If you are required to tell the company the vulnerability, how can you possibly negotiate\" a price for your efforts, said President Bob Weiss of Password Crackers Inc., a North Potomac, Md., firm that helps companies recover information hidden on their machines.</p><p>With fewer business opportunities, some hackers may migrate to the black market, where they can earn $5,000 selling programs that take advantage of an unpublicized hole to spammers, organized crime figures and other unsavory customers, said Mark Loveless, a BindView Corp. security researcher and former malicious hacker.</p><p>But he said the larger worry was that new laws, proposed legislation and the OIS guidelines were combining to undermine the security of computer networks.</p><p>\"It all points to the direction of less information,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATE-F0SF63S</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4B3T-4XM0-TW84-N20T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2003 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName> Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Home Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>November 28, 2003 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000236R</classCode><className>SYMANTEC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS334614 SOFTWARE &amp;

Currently, Google and Facebook account for around 90pc of the market in the UK, the CMA found.</p><p>In response to the criticism on Wednesday, a spokesman for the CMA said the \"range of the concerns we have found requires a new regulatory regime rather than a one off intervention - the regime we are proposing will go further than a market investigation could ever go\".</p><p>It had said \"weak competition in search and social media leads to reduced innovation and choice, as well as to consumers giving up more data than they would like\".</p><p>\"This recommendation to government is the result of a year-long examination of the markets.

''A lot of people want to say this election is just about getting rid of <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>That's the floor, not the ceiling.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mr. Booker was seeking to flip the national narrative, drawing voters to the layered chapters of his political biography: the telegenic liberal mayor of a downtrodden New Jersey city who went on to become a senator and an adversary of <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>But the sheer breadth and diversity of the Democratic field have weighed on Mr. Booker, one of his party's long-rising stars, who had been seen as a possible presidential candidate since he burst onto the scene two decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  His presidential r\u00e9sum\u00e9 mirrors that of other rivals who are ahead of him in the polls. The sensible, Rhodes scholar, get-things-done mayor? Shared with Mayor <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg </nameText></person>of South Bend, Ind. The groundbreaking African-American candidate? Taken by Senator <person><nameText>Kamala Harris </nameText></person>of California.</p><p>  The trip to Iowa was Mr. Booker's fourth of this campaign, evidence of the need for a strong showing in this first caucus state for any hope of a successful run through to South Carolina, where Mr. Booker is hoping for a victory. The entrance of former Vice President <person><nameText>Joseph R. Biden </nameText></person>Jr. into the race puts added pressure on Mr. Booker, especially competing for black voters -- a major piece of the Democratic constituency in the South, and a group that has largely supported Mr. Biden in early polls.</p><p>  On the trail, Mr. Booker is still campaigning with an ebullient style, recording selfie videos for voters and cracking self-deprecating ''dad jokes'' at every stop. He even broke briefly into song during an interview, singing a few bars of ''My City of Ruins'' by Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>  But stuck in the low single digits in both national and early state polls, with a middling small-dollar fund-raising operation, he has started to sprinkle his unity-themed stump speech with some slight contrasts to other Democratic candidates.</p><p>  ''I'm one of those Democrats to say we need to start doing things that make people's lives better, because Democrats have done things that have made people's lives worse,'' Mr. Booker said at a house party in Newton, referring to the 1994 crime bill that Mr. Biden supported while he was in the Senate, and which experts say contributed to mass incarceration.</p><p>  And in calls for party solidarity, he offered a veiled critique of the hesitance of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>  ''I hope that one of the questions you ask every single candidate is, if you're not the person, that you will commit to us that you will double down and support the person who is the nominee,'' Mr. Booker told the crowd in Newton. ''I saw that movie in 2016. I don't want to relive it.''</p><p>  Though he claims to try to avoid direct attacks on <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>-- ''The more attention we give him, the more oxygen he takes,'' Mr. Booker said -- he has increased his criticisms, including taking a generational swipe at him as he looked ahead to the stakes of the climate change fight ''20 years from now, when I'm the age of this current president.''</p><p>  To hear Mr. Booker describe it, he is ''pumped'' about his campaign's status, a slow-but-steady strategy espoused by the ''Brick by Brick'' slogan seen on signs at a town-hall-style event in Burlington on Saturday and on his campaign social media accounts.</p><p>  ''I think if you look at the fundamentals of what has won past competitive Iowa primaries, we are doing extraordinarily well,'' Mr. Booker said in an interview. ''The folks who know the politics in the state will unequivocally tell you we have the best organization on the ground.''</p><p>  While supporters in Iowa are confident in his message, some are perplexed at his stagnant polling.</p><p>  ''I don't know if it is because the message of love, and some people don't necessarily connect to that,'' said Rachelle Chase, 55, from Ottumwa, who has written two books about the Buxton coal mines, where Mr. Booker's great-great-grandparents worked. ''But I think what appeals to me is that he's being authentic.''</p><p>  His focus on Iowa, with 30 events held as of Sunday and a staff of 50 in the state, and his pledge to unveil a ''Marshall Plan'' for rural America could help him build momentum.</p><p>  ''These are areas that have experienced a lot of difficult economic times,'' said Representative Dave Loebsack, who accompanied Mr. Booker on Saturday and represents an Iowa district Mr. Trump won in 2016. ''I think just listening to them and talking to them along economic lines is the most important thing candidates can do.''</p><p>  Mr. Booker made a splash nationally with his sweeping gun reform policy, and earned kudos from many voters this weekend for his vocal response to the wave of new state bills restricting abortion. And he teased thoughts on regulating social media companies, taking direct aim at criticisms that he has been too cozy with big tech.</p><p>  ''I think that having better control of your own data and information is really important, and restricting the ability of platforms to be able to use your data for their profit,'' Mr. Booker said in an interview. ''This is a space where we need to regulate, and having more transparency in that area is something we need to regulate.''</p><p>  His flatlining in the national polls has not helped an already struggling small-dollar fund-raising network; just 16 percent of his donations in the first three months of the year were $200 or less. Instead, Mr. Booker has kept a steady pace of high-dollar fund-raising events, and his campaign has roughly two dozen fund-raisers across six states already on the books for the next month.</p><p>  Though he pledged in an interview to release the names of his bundlers -- supporters who gather donations from friends and business associates -- he said he currently would not allow pooled news media coverage of his fund-raisers as Mr. Biden has.</p><p>  Mr. Booker did get one small-dollar boost on Saturday. While touring the flood damage in downtown Muscatine, Mr. Booker was stopped by two local farmers, Garry and Carolyn Reid. They farm 20,000 bushels of corn and soybeans per year, and said they had lost 85 cents per bushel as a result of Mr. Trump's trade war.</p><p>  Since then, Mr. Reid said, the federal government deposited $200 into their bank account from an emergency fund. So Mr. Reid, 83, took $25 from that and donated it to Mr. Booker's campaign.</p><p>  ''You have no idea how much this encourages me,'' Mr. Booker said.</p><p>  ''Well,'' Mr. Reid replied, tugging on his suspenders and offering a smirk, ''it's going to take more than that.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Senator Cory Booker </nameText></person>in Chariton, Iowa, last week.

Always in pursuit of lofty goals, he usually quiets naysayers with concrete achievements. Snyder earned three Michigan degrees by age 23, made partner at then-Coopers and Lybrand in six years, left to run computer manufacturer Gateway Inc. (where he became president and COO), and then set up venture capital fund Ardesta in Ann Arbor. Snyder also helped create and lead Ann Arbor SPARK, the public-private economic development organization for the Ann Arbor area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Snyder is running for governor of Michigan on the Republican ticket, joining fellow Ross alumnus Pete Hoekstra, MBA '77, to battle for the party's nomination. Snyder has never held political office, but he thinks that might be a strength right now. The state's economy is reeling, with the Democratic governor and Republicans in the state senate battling over the budget. Snyder has seen enough, and says it's time to bring private-sector innovation to state government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dividend: Why did you decide to run for governor, despite never having held office before?</p><p>Snyder: The most frequently asked question I get is, \"Why would you want to be governor?\" And the interesting part is the intonation as much as the question. People wonder why someone would want the job given the circumstances. But I really do, and it's for the intersection of three reasons. One, Michigan is an economic disaster. We're losing a million jobs this decade, we have 15 percent unemployment (and that's probably understated). We're losing a family every 12 minutes. Two, I believe there's a fundamental lack of leadership in Lansing. There's no clear direction, there's no vision, they're ignoring problems, and using Band-Aids instead of long-term, structural fixes. And they're in conflict instead of working together for the common good. Three, I don't believe that a traditional politician is the answer. I think [traditional politicians] come from a culture that's broken. We need to bring the knowledge and tools from the business world to get us on a positive track and fundamentally reinvent the economy in this state and in our government.</p><p>Dividend: We've heard plans to reinvent government before from others. How can you, as a political outsider, get that done?</p><p>Snyder: Look at the business world: We reinvent ourselves multiple times or we wouldn't be in business. There have been a number of periods where that's the case. You can look at the period we're in now, or look at the tech bubble period. You can identify multiple periods where if we didn't reinvent our practices we would have been put out of business. Those are the kind of skill sets we've learned that we need to apply to government. A simple case I like to talk about is the budgeting process. It's been an absolute failure in the state of Michigan. We shut down in 2007 and we shut down again this time. They didn't hit the midnight deadline. What's underlying that, besides a culture that doesn't work, is that it's an old-fashioned cost-activity budget. Your business would never survive if you did cost-based budgeting. There's where departments ask for money, say they're doing to do a whole bunch of stuff, and then next year ask for more money so they can do more stuff.</p><p>What we need is outcomes-based budgeting, which lays out a set of outcomes to achieve. We would be held accountable and measured against other states and even other countries. We want to deliver results and tell people, 'This is how we're going to build up a budget. You, as citizens, customers, want to buy these services and deliver these outcomes.' They say you can't do that in government. Well, it's worked successfully in other places, why aren't we looking at it here? The state of Washington has been doing this since 2003. They had a major budget crisis, a $2.5 billion deficit, they had to cut 10 percent of the budget, and they went through outcomes-based budgeting. I like to call it value-for-money budgeting because we need to show value for money to our customers, the citizens. And they went out and surveyed people from both parties. And people from both parties thought the process worked. Independents thought the process worked. So here you have a situation where you can get everyone on board. Everyone might not be thrilled, but they understand it's a fair and open process involving citizen input in a way that builds up a project with real outcomes and real results. Why aren't we doing that? It's been done. It's not impossible in government.</p><p>Dividend: You've been successful in business, and very community-oriented, but you're running for a statewide office against some people with big name recognition and political machines behind them. What's your plan for getting to the governor's office?</p><p>Snyder: Our campaign is a startup. I've done multiple startups. It's the same fundamentals you have in any business. You start with a vision, you put a plan in place, you build a first-class team, and you have an underlying culture. We've put all of those in place, we're executing well, and we've already shaken these people up. I think they've gotten the message. This campaign is for real and it's really about re-inventing Michigan. So we have their full attention now and we're only going to keep putting on the pressure. The way I view it, I'm not running against other people. I'm running for the right reason, to re-invent Michigan. And we're running a clear, positive campaign with a vision and a plan of action. It's all about the economy, this election. That's the big issue. Priority number one is the economy. So is priority two, priority three, and all down the list. And I'm a person with experience in the economic sector and I know what it's like to create a job. These other people don't. So I'm going to run this positive campaign, I'm going to focus on the economy, and get it on track to build it for the next generation or two. I think the [other candidates] are going to be trailing after me. They're already picking up on my language on how to handle economic issues because I don't think they understand it as well as they need to.</p><p>Dividend: We have an incumbent leaving and a poor state economy, so if there were a time when the public might embrace an outsider, do you think this is it?</p><p>Snyder: I think people are excited. When I talk to people, I get a great response. My main issue is name recognition, getting out there and getting known. People know most of this stuff is common sense. Politicians have lacked transparency and have been caught up in this win/lose attitude. It's a culture that just doesn't work. We need to get out of that and break out in the open and say, 'We can all win together. We can make Michigan a great state again.' It's about Michiganders stepping up and taking our state back from people who are not doing their job right so we can run it the appropriate way. I often ask, 'If our government were a business, what would you do with these people?' And the answer I get from many people is, 'Fire them.' So why do we put up with this?</p><p>Dividend: You sound frustrated, so in deciding to run for governor, was there a moment, an event, where you said, 'That's it. I'm going to do this.'</p><p>Snyder: It was more a family process. I never had been focused on running for governor. When I was 15 or 16, I built a career plan. I said I was going to have three careers. My first career was going to be in the private sector. I wanted to be where most people are, out in the 'real world' and do financially well enough where I could take care of my family. My goals there have been, make money, help people, and have fun. Those were my guiding principles. I thought in my 40s or 50s I would drop the 'make money' part and focus on fun and public service, things like volunteer work and Ann Arbor SPARK. The third career would be to teach again. And I really had been focused on that. We had a family agreement that it would be another five years or so before I would do public service because my youngest is in the eighth grade, and we were going to wait for her to get out of high school. So Sue, my wife, actually came to me and said, 'I can see how you feel about the state, how messed up we are, and you're the best person to go solve this problem. We should talk about it as a family to see if we're up for this challenge.' And we were. We spent about a month talking to the kids.</p><p>Dividend: You talk a lot about innovation. You've done it, and we talk a lot about it at Ross. What kind of innovations have you developed in the campaign?</p><p>Snyder: One true innovation that reinforces the Re-invent Michigan message is a program called Run with Rick. We have a vision for a new era: a 10-point plan and a set of cultural values. We are encouraging anyone to run for office on a similar platform. If they want to adopt the vision plan and culture model that we have, we're encouraging them to run on the same platform. And we've already signed up about 100 people who are interested. Most of them are for precinct delegate, but we're interested in people running for state legislator, county commissioner, or city council. I'm even encouraging incumbents to join the platform because it's the right thing to do for Michigan. I think that's an innovation because most of these people are new to politics. Here's an opportunity to enter a process because you believe it's broken, and be part of the solution. That's innovation</p><p>The second thing we did is launch something called Rick's Innovation Network, which is some cool 'get-out-the-vote technology' that even Obama didn't optimize. So we're trying to go to the next level there. And we used that for our conference on Mackinac Island where we basically leveraged computer databases with cell phone cameras. So if volunteers wanted to participate, they could go around and do things to log in and say they've gone out and voted in a straw poll, attended the debate, or talked to somebody interested in the campaign. Then we set up symbols around the island where they could use their cell phone camera to take a picture and it would be logged in the database. So we're hoping to leverage that as the campaign progresses. These career politicians have been around forever, and in the space of just a few months we've shown more innovation than they have in their careers.</p><p>Dividend: You are a product of the new economy, or what we used to call the new economy, and you've lived in other states. You've also led a big tech company. What does Michigan need to do rebound, and how would you get that done?</p><p>Snyder: We need to change the concept of government from bureaucracy to customer service. The role of government should be to serve our citizens and customers. And everything we do shouldn't be through the lens of, 'We're government and we're going to go out and do stuff.' It should be, 'If you're a citizen, how can we help you be more successful?' And within that we need to be much more competitive on our tax and regulatory system. The MBT is the dumbest tax in the United States. Our regulatory system is biased toward assuming people are bad and they need to be controlled, versus the average citizen is a good and you need to deal with the exceptions. So we need to actually make a much more competitive playing field and reduce these Band-Aid things like incentives. If you have a competitive playing field, you don't need Band-Aids. The second thing is to go to the concept of value-for-money budgeting. What's the return on investment we're giving you? Why are we a good shopping choice? We need to be showing our worth to be on your shopping list.</p><p>Dividend: That all makes sense, and in the business world you can make these kind of decisions. But in the government you have a legislature that may or may not agree with what you're trying to do that also has a big say in how things are run. How would you deal with that?</p><p>Snyder: I love that question, because it just shows the lack of touch politicians have with the real world. They like to say, 'You don't understand, you can't do that.' Or they say, 'You're a CEO/manager-type and you're used to telling people what to do.' Any business person knows what an ignorant statement that is. The only way you win in business is a five-way win. It doesn't matter what your title is in a company. The only way you win is that you make it so your customers win, your shareholders win, your employees win, your suppliers win, and your community wins. If any one of those groups is out of sync, your business is at risk. So you may not be around if you don't understand how to take care of multiple constituencies and create an environment where they all win.</p><p>Dividend: True but they are stakeholders in your business and have a vested interest in your success.</p><p>Snyder: Customers don't. You have to convince them to buy from you every time.</p><p>Dividend: I guess I'm thinking about dealing with someone in the legislature from an opposing party who may be intractable, depending on the issue.</p><p>Snyder: You don't need to get everyone on board. That's the good thing about the majority ruling. The idea is much like the adoption curve when you come up with a new idea. In the tech sector, you go to your early adopters, you get your fast followers, those in the middle, and then some laggards. So you just understand how to develop those things. I've been doing that for years. Ann Arbor SPARK is one tangible illustration of bringing people together with different backgrounds. We were able to bring together the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, the community college, the city, the county, many other jurisdictions, and the private sector and get them all on the same page to have one organization represent them on economic development. I wrote the business plan for the organization, I chaired it until the last few months, and now it's become one of the most successful organizations in the country. So there's a crystal clear case of pulling together an extremely divergent group of parties to move ahead on a topic of great importance: economic issues.</p><p>Dividend: What did you learn at Ross that maybe you've applied to your career and your campaign?</p><p>Snyder: I learned a lot there. That's a tough question because it's blended so much into my life. It's just part of me. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the people I met in business school had work experience. Here I was, a kid of 19, working in teams with these people. And it was just an awesome experience when people who had divergent backgrounds developed the chemistry to work as a team. It's one of those soft things, but it was a critical skill set to learn.</p><p>I've faced the challenge of people saying I can't do something my entire career. Actually, I thrive on that. I built this plan to get three degrees in six years when I was 16. So I designed it to get my bachelor's when I was 19, my MBA when I was 20, and my law degree when I was 23. I was an adjunct professor in the business school teaching tax when I was 24, 25, 26. I'd show up and most of the people were older than I was. But that's an important lesson. Teaching working people isn't taking the position that you're smarter or better than anyone else. I just happen to have more knowledge in the field, and we're there to learn together. We're all solid people. People aren't better than one another. The question is, how can you take that knowledge and share those tools with other people so we can all learn together? That's the same kind of message I want to bring to government.</p><p>Dividend: I'm sure our marketing professors would like to know why you decided to use your first name on campaign signs, Rick For Michigan, instead of the last names you usually see.</p><p>Snyder: I did it to send a message that this isn't about being isolated, being the politician who isn't accessible. This is about us working together. Short-term, people actually gave us some grief over this because nobody, I mean the general public, knew who I was. They would say, 'Are you Rick Michigan?' and I have fun with that. But as we get into the later phases of the campaign, hopefully it sends the message that this is about all of us moving together as a team. And we're having a lot of fun going around in an RV we've wrapped, tailgating at the Michigan games, and inviting people to sign the bus.</p><p>But there's a tremendous amount of hard work that needs to be done to get Michigan back on track. We need to do that with a positive attitude and we need to find parts that are enjoyable about this. Many people are suffering terribly today. It's a tragedy and some of it didn't need to happen. The government could have done much more to mitigate or prevent some of these things. It's time for us to step up, get our government on track to be that customer service business, and fundamentally reinvent out state. The goal is to get us on that long-term path to being a top-tier state again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1113005551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7X46-RWR0-Y9NS-B2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>November 18, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the system can collect sensor data from an underground utility vault, and is capable of transmitting its signals 45 miles.

'Google leverages its market power in both general search services and ad tech services to the detriment of consumers, advertisers and news publishers,' News Corp.</p><p>said in its petition to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. News Corp. owns several major publications, including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and a number of high-profile international outlets. The petition comes a week after presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled her plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Warren's proposal to rein in Silicon Valley compared the current tech landscape to a modern day Gilded Age, where smaller companies are 'bulldozed' by the big players. 'We need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor,' Warren said. Also Read: Rupert Murdoch and Sons Pay Soars as Fox-Disney Deal Awaits Completion[2] News Corp. recommended Google could either sell Google Search or 'divest the rest of its businesses to a third party' to 'remedy' the 'harms' its placed on its competitors. Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported last month it earned nearly $137 billion in revenue last year, with the vast majority of its sales stemming from its advertising business. The company added: 'While News Corp Australia recognises that divestment is a very serious step, and not a foregone conclusion in cases where there is a finding of market power, News Corp Australia considers that divestment is necessary in the case of Google, due to the unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.' Google did not immediately respond to TheWrap's request for comment. Also Read: Google and Facebook's Complete and Total Digital Ad Domination Explained in 1 Chart[3] It's unclear how the Australian regulators, even if they're inclined to follow each recommendation from News Corp., would begin to break up the American tech giant. Still, the proposal shows once again Murdoch's willingness to take on Silicon Valley. Last year, Murdoch pushed Facebook, the internet's second-biggest ad company after Google, to pay publishers a 'carriage fee,' similar to cable television. 'If Facebook wants to recognize 'trusted' publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,' Murdoch said. 'The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services.'Related stories from TheWrap: Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal Rips Trump for 'Absurd' and 'Cracked History' of Afghanistan[4]Did Nick Clegg Audition for Top Facebook Job With 2017 Essay Defending Company Against Rupert Murdoch?[5]Malcolm McDowell to Play Rupert Murdoch in Roger Ailes Film[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/News%20Corp%20Australia%20%28March%202019%29.pdf\">https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/News%20Corp%20Australia%20%28March%202019%29.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-james-pay-soars-fox-disney-deal\">https://www.thewrap.com/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-james-pay-soars-fox-disney-deal</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/02/08/google-facebook-digital-ad-domination-chart/\">https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/02/08/google-facebook-digital-ad-domination-chart/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-rips-trump-for-absurd-cracked-history-afghanistan\">https://www.thewrap.com/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-rips-trump-for-absurd-cracked-history-afghanistan</url>/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/did-nick-clegg-audition-for-top-facebook-job-with-2017-essay-defending-company-against-rupert-murdoch\">https://www.thewrap.com/did-nick-clegg-audition-for-top-facebook-job-with-2017-essay-defending-company-against-rupert-murdoch</url>/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/malcolm-mcdowell-to-play-rupert-murdoch-in-roger-ailes-film\">https://www.thewrap.com/malcolm-mcdowell-to-play-rupert-murdoch-in-roger-ailes-film</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WRAP1056501552414038052251761300080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRAP-5357</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMF-56G1-JCMN-Y4J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><timeReceived>6:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Wrap</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But in Google's case, it might just be met with a sigh of relief.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more than a year, antitrust regulators at America's Department of Justice have been circling the internet search giant, and this summer they have been gradually closing in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although three other big US tech companies - Apple, Amazon and Facebook - are in Washington's crosshairs, Google has long stood out as the most likely candidate for monopoly charges.</p><p>The groundwork for building a case against the company has already been laid. Rivals such as Yelp have been griping about Google's control over its search engine and the internet's advertising infrastructure for years.</p><p>The company has been dealt three competition-related fines in Europe, amounting to billions of euros. Google is appealing all three.</p><p>Legal experts believe Google has the biggest case to answer. Unlike Amazon, Apple and Facebook, which do not have such obviously dominant market positions, Google accounts for at least 80pc of worldwide internet searches. The web's second most popular search bar appears on YouTube, which is also owned by Google.</p><p>Last week, reports emerged that the justice department's long-running antitrust investigation against Google was coming to a close. According to The New York Times, William Barr, the US attorney general, has been pushing lawyers for a case against the company to be filed by the end of this month.</p><p>Even if this timeline slips, pursuing charges before November's presidential election is likely to be a priority. While Donald Trump is unlikely to see cracking down on Silicon Valley as much of a vote-winner (tech companies remain largely popular, and barely register as political issues next to the pandemic, the economic crisis and social division), appearing to take action against Google will at least look like a proactive step.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, it would be a victory for Barr, who would be replaced in a Biden administration.</p><p>But at the same time, the urgency to bring charges has led to fears it could be a hastily prepared case.</p><p>Several justice department lawyers have reportedly stepped away from the investigation or said they will refuse to endorse charges, fearing they will not be strong enough to triumph in US courts.</p><p>State-level prosecutors, who have been separately investigating the company, are also said to be split along political lines as to whether to join the justice department.</p><p>Stalling may be unwarranted. Lawyers are likely to ask for more time on just about anything, and regulators have had plenty of time to study Google's allegedly anti-competitive tactics. But any suggestion that a case will have been hastily put together is likely to concern anyone who believes the company's power should be curtailed.</p><p>Unlike the monopoly enforcement model typically employed in Europe, in which companies are fined then have the option of a lengthy legal appeal, US prosecutors who are unable to settle an investigation must argue their case in court to secure punishment. And when they try, they often lose.</p><p>In August, a US judge shot down claims from the Federal Trade Commission that chipmaker Qualcomm had unfairly pushed out rival companies. Last year, the justice department failed to get a court to undo a merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. A long history of US case law has made it exceedingly difficult for the government to win monopoly cases, especially when a service is provided for free to the consumer, as it is with Google.</p><p>All of this means that if the world's biggest search engine is to face competition charges in its home market, any case must be airtight.</p><p>Lawyers abandoning the case because they fear it is being rushed does not suggest it will be. It is fair to say that Google would rather fight a hastily put-together legal challenge now than a comprehensive one later.</p><p>The picture that emerges is of a system that looks set up not to tame the tech giants, even if concerns about them are legitimate. Even when taking action against Google has support from both parties, and prosecutors have no shortage of complaints to investigate, the prospects for a successful challenge against the company, let alone the break-up that some would advocate, are unclear. The same could be true for Amazon, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>The more likely path to US competition crackdowns against Silicon Valley could be new laws, a prospect that a Congressional committee is investigating, but which might prove difficult in today's gridlocked Washington.</p><p>While taking action against the tech giants is a rare bipartisan issue in Washington, Republicans and Democrats want different things. One side claims Silicon Valley is censoring speech, the other that it is centralising power and amassing too much wealth. The proposed solutions differ, which partly explains why no significant tech regulation has come into force despite a widespread clamour for something to be done.</p><p>A new face in the White House may be able to break that gridlock.</p><p>But for now, Washington seems ill-equipped to take on Big Tech.</p><p>'Prosecutors must argue monopoly cases in the US in court - and they often lose'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-162957550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SJ-KRW1-JCBW-N0R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Russia Formally Warns Google, Facebook Against Election 'Interference' ...ddlingFor the second time in under a month Russia has warned Google and Facebook against election 'interference' and meddling in Russian domestic politics. On ThursdayRussian communications regulator Roskomnadzor formally asked[3] the US search engine and social media giants to halt political advertising during the upcoming weekendof regional elections. Several regional elections are set to be held on Sept. 8, meaning Sept.7-8 are designated political ad and campaign 'silent days' in accord with Russian law. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/russiaelectionposters.jpg?itok=DyJXIBOBRussia\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/russiaelectionposters.jpg?itok=DyJXIBOBRussia</url> will vote in nationwide regional elections on Sunday. Image source:Moskva News Agency/Moscow TimesNon-compliance will be viewed as meddling in Russia's sovereign affairs, according to a statement issued byRoskomnadzor.Russia 'will perceive this as interference into internal affairs, hostile influence to disrupt election and will have a right to act accordingly,' the Russian media regulator and watchdog said.The agency made the request Friday, and it follows a prior letter[4] sent to Google in mid-August similarly warningelection 'interference' would not be tolerated. The prior letter came amidst a summer of widespread protests in Russia against corruption and the ruling United Russia party. The previous request demanded Google-owned YouTube refrain from allowing 'push notices' which facilitates and promotes'mass events, including those aimed at disrupting elections of federal and regional significance.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/facebookHQ.jpg?itok=eLn03evTFacebook's\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/facebookHQ.jpg?itok=eLn03evTFacebook's</url> headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Getty Image.Ironically this comes the same week security teams for Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft held meetings with multiple US federal agencies to coordinate and strategize over how to prevent and best safeguard against foreign election meddling in the 2020 presidential election. The US internet giants metwith the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence's officeat Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters on Wednesday, the companyconfirmed. 'For Facebook, we've developed a comprehensive strategy to close previous vulnerabilities, while analyzing and getting ahead of new threats,' the company'shead of cybersecurity policy,Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a statement[5]. 'Improving election security and countering information operations are complex challenges that no organization can solve alone.'

So what is going on with the vaccine that we all want?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's connect you to some of the answers. Four months after the Coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill, the race for a vaccine has accelerated anyway never seen before. More than 100 vaccines are now under development around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only two dozen are in human trials, including one of the world's largest right here in the United Arab Emirates. On Monday, Moderna began phase 3 of its testing on humans. The vaccine slowed the spread of the virus in monkeys, and that suggested high doses might prevent spreading even if people do get infected.</p><p>Brazil's Health Ministry expects to begin distributing a vaccine by the end of the year. That vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca has been undergoing phase 3 testing in Brazil. Pfizer and Biotech began a human trial of their vaccine in the U.S. on Monday but miles ahead of all of those companies is Russia, or so they say.</p><p>Officials there announced that they could approve a Coronavirus vaccine by August the 10th. That is less than two weeks from now. The speed by which the vaccine is being rushed has caught many by surprise and raised questions about its safety and effectiveness.</p><p>Russia says it's using a vaccine that was already in development, but Russia was recently accused of hacking into vaccine research facilities. Well, now the race is taking on political dimensions. Matthew Chance joins us now from Moscow with the details, as you understand them. Matt?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky thanks so much. Well that's right. August the 10th is the date. As you mentioned, the Russian officials are saying they're intending to have this Russian vaccine approved and being administered to the most vulnerable categories of Russian society starting off with front line medical workers.</p><p>It's raised further doubts about how effective, how safe this Russian vaccine could be, because it is so far ahead of the competition, as it were, as you just mentioned. What Russian officials say is, look, part of the answer to that is about the technology, that they're using technology they used in the past to create other successful vaccines, notably an Ebola vaccine from several years ago.</p><p>They simply amended that vaccine to make it able to fight Coronavirus. So there is a sort of scientific, technological basis for that. They say there are lots of clinical trials with that technology, and that's helped them speed things through.</p><p>But undoubtedly as well, it's the attitude or the ability of Russia, the willingness of Russia to ignore the conventions of human trials that has allowed them to speed through this process where other countries that are doing this have been held back.</p><p>For instance, the scientists that were first developing the Russian vaccine, they injected themselves and their staff members inside the laboratories before human trials had even formally begun. Then when they did begin, they used volunteers, we're told by the French Ministry, who were soldiers, something that in the west that doesn't tend to happen.</p><p>And now in the third and very crucial human trial period, which is normally the phase that's gone through before the vaccine is released onto the open market and is administered to the population at large, Russian officials are saying that those third phase of human trials will take place in parallel to the drug being approved and given to front line medical workers.</p><p>[11:05:00]</p><p>CHANCE: And so it's the ability of Russia to be able to lower the sort of bar, as it were, and to cut through, as they would call it, the red tape and to get this drug out there as soon as possible that has enabled them to do it so quickly. It's risky, of course, but because of the severity of the Coronavirus outbreak in Russia, officials say it's a risk they're willing to take Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Matthew Chance is in Moscow for you. Thank you, Matt. Well, the British government also at the forefront of the race for a vaccine signing a major supply deals with pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Glaxo-Smith- Kline.</p><p>Now the deal would provide 60 million doses of the vaccine turn in development and is the fourth option secured by the UK. Well, there are many people who are comparing this global vaccine race to the space race full of geopolitics. CNN's Melissa Bell has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FABIEN PERUGI, HEAD OF PRE-CLINICAL RESEARCH, VALNEVA: We have taken virus from patients after we have to prove by the virus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNNPARIS CORRESPONDENT: The race for a vaccine has never been so fierce. Across the world, 166 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being worked on. Like Valneva here in Western France, the European pharmaceutical company has just sold 16 million doses of its potential future vaccine to the United Kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERUGI: The aim is to provide, at the end of 2021, 16 million doses and after to increase also the capacity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Valneva is hoping to be ready for clinical trials by the end of this year. 24 other companies developing vaccines are already in that phase and for now many governments are hedging their bets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCK GRIMAUD, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO BUSINESS OFFICER, VALNEVA: All governments are absolutely aware that the public is fully at risk. They place ultimately five to ten pay holders on different programs, and they know that at the end most likely only three would be successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Which is why the British deal with Valneva comes as part of a broader deal with other companies? In July the United Kingdom opted out of an EU vaccine alliance. It was created by four European countries to make up for the lack of coordination at EU level. European negotiations with Valneva continue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIMAUD: I think it was - saying Europe watches the full number, and it's exactly a little bit the same here. In the U.S., there is one urgency - a lesson to learn from this crisis is that if we could have one centralized EU border, let's say, would make it next time more efficient in terms of dealing with this kind of disease.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: The four country strong European alliance has now reached one deal for 400,000 vaccines with AstraZeneca. But it has yet to build the sort of portfolio announced by the United Kingdom on Monday. And Valneva's first vaccines will go not to European countries but to the UK, their former EU partner. Melissa Bell, Paris.</p><p>ANDERSON: My next guest is Editor-in-Chief of \"The Lancet,\" one of the world's oldest medical publications. He's been closely following the pandemic, as you would expect him to have done, and just released the book entitled \"The COVID-19 Catastrophe: What's gone wrong and how to stop it happening again\" Richard Horton joining me now from London.</p><p>I want to get your reaction firstly to this Russian vaccine announcement described by the Head of the Sovereign World Fund there who is funding this as Russia's sputnik moment, your thoughts?</p><p>RICHARD HORTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE LANCET: Well, I welcome any vaccine candidate that can be put through careful, safety and efficacy, including clinical trials. We really need to be very careful to manage expectations. We have a long way to go to make sure that we have a safe and effective vaccine.</p><p>Corners cannot be cut. We have to make sure that we keep public confidence high in the possibility of a vaccine, and that means that we have to follow the proper protocols. So I would take very good care about being too speculative.</p><p>ANDERSON: Are you suggesting that corners must have been cut given the reduced time span in which the Russians say that they can announce this approved vaccine? They are talking about mid-August.</p><p>HORTON: From the science that I've seen, Becky, there is absolutely no way there is a safe and effective vaccine that can be ready for mid-August.</p><p>[11:10:00]</p><p>HORTON: We're only seeing phase 1 and phase 2, in other words, early clinical trials, being published now. There is just no possibility of a vaccine being widely available by mid-August with the assurance that it is safe.</p><p>ANDERSON: So where are we? Who are the frontrunners, and when do you think we will get a vaccine, sir?</p><p>HORTON: Well, we do have several hundred vaccines that are currently in development with about 15 to 20 in human clinical trials, as I think you've already been discussing on your program. There are many different strategies that are being used for those vaccines, and that's good, because some will be successful and some will fail, and we need to be able to see which of those will work.</p><p>So at the moment it's not entirely clear which are going to be the most effective. What I can tell you is that the early vaccines are delivering strong immune responses. That's to say the body is reacting positively to the vaccines. It's producing a strong response in the way that we really need to be sure that we're going to get an effective vaccine.</p><p>So I would say, Becky, we're at first base and we have every reason to be optimistic and encouraged by the results so far.</p><p>ANDERSON: And do you expect, when we do get a vaccine, that it will be a one for life vaccine, or that we will need this on an annual booster basis?</p><p>HORTON: It's very; very unlikely it's going to be a one off for life, Becky. There is a lot that we don't know at the moment. We still don't know how long immunity lasts when you get the infection, and we certainly don't know how long immunity lasts if you have a vaccine?</p><p>But my estimate so far is that we will be needing to take a vaccine perhaps once every year to get a boost to our immune response, and that's going to be especially important for those who are most at risk. That's older people in our communities, people who are living with chronic diseases, maybe black and minority ethnic populations.</p><p>There are going to be particular groups in our society who need the vaccine first and may need a boost.</p><p>ANDERSON: I want to talk about the response to this pandemic. You have been extremely critical of the UK government's handling of Corona, at one point calling it the greatest science policy failure for a generation. Why do you believe that the UK got it so wrong? Are they, to your mind now, doing better? And what do you make of these reinstitution of these quarantine policies on countries, for example, like Spain?</p><p>HORTON: Well, first of all, it's not just the United Kingdom that's suffered the greatest science policy failures. It's pretty much all western democracies. And the reason why I feel so exorcised about this is that we published five research papers in \"The Lancet\" at the end of January in the very last week of January that described how severe this illness was in Wuhan?</p><p>Brand new viruses, no treatment, tipping people into intensive care with high mortality pass through person to person. The urgent need for personal protective equipments, scaling up mass testing in communities and a risk of a global pandemic.</p><p>Becky we knew all this before the end of January, and then we didn't do anything. We didn't do enough. We didn't pick up the signal that was coming from Chinese scientists. Now we're in a geopolitical situation where the west is blaming China, creating this cold war version 2 and actually what we should be doing is thanking Chinese scientists for the warnings that they gave the world.</p><p>So, yes, I feel very aggrieved about the western response, because many tens of thousands of deaths were entirely avoidable. Now you ask about the quarantine situation. This very blunt thought of blocking a whole country is not a sustainable solution, just as lockdowns for a whole country are not sustainable solutions.</p><p>If we're going to live with this virus, and we are going to have to live with this virus, this virus isn't going away any time soon. We have to have a much more subtle, a much more nuanced approach to the way our countries react to one another. That means mapping the virus in countries.</p><p>If there is a particular part of a country where transmission is high, that's the part of the country we need to be concerned about. So I'm afraid I don't think that our approach to quarantining everybody coming from Spain is the right way forward. It's simply bad science and it's not sustainable.</p><p>[11:15:00]</p><p>ANDERSON: How is it that a country likes the one that I'm in here, the UAE? This is our Middle East Broadcasting Hub, are able to conduct 5 million tests in a population of 10 million? That's 50 percent.</p><p>And have a positivity rate of one percent or possibly less than that when other countries around the world - and by the way, the health system here is extremely well organized and the leadership extremely well organized as well and clearly responded very quickly.</p><p>Why is it that a country like this can respond the way it did, compared to what you see, for example, in the United States? We've had a pop at the UK. Let's talk about the U.S.</p><p>HORTON: Well, this comes down to a political leadership that is sensitive to the science and that is attuned to the risks. You're talking about the country you're in where clearly the political leaders were listening to the scientists and were able to pivot very quickly to protect its citizens.</p><p>Very strangely - the United States of America is the science superpower of the world. It's got some of the greatest scientists in the world, but the connection between science and government is almost nonexistent.</p><p>And with a President who shows nothing but disdain for science, there is a culture that it's impossible for the country to mount a response in the way that one would have wished. So we have at the moment in the United States a genuine national crisis.</p><p>ANDERSON: Very briefly, and I'm just running out of time here. You talked earlier about not having listened to China when it was sharing information at the outset of this pandemic. Did they share enough, sir?</p><p>HORTON: There is a period between December the 1st when - as far as we know the very first patients were being admitted to hospital in Wuhan and December 31st when they made information about the outbreak known to the rest of the world, there is a period between - in December where we don't know enough about what happened?</p><p>And we need to understand what took place in December? If we could have had a few extra weeks in December, maybe we could have moved faster. But Chinese scientists themselves did an absolutely remarkable job to identify the virus, sequence sets and prepare the world for we are now living through.</p><p>ANDERSON: With that we're going to leave it there, but we will absolutely have you back, sir. Thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.</p><p>HORTON: Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: The Editor of \"The Lancet.\" Coming up, big tech CEOs, including two of the world's richest men, will soon face Congress in an historic antitrust lawsuit, more on that after this.</p><p>And it was an event that caught the attention of millions of fans from all over the world. CNN Sport speaks to the Head of the UFC about hosting its first series of fights since the COVID-19 pandemic right here at Fight Island in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>[11:20:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. STELLA IMMANUEL, PHYSICIAN: It's what we call astral sex. That means this person is not really a demon or nephilim he is just a human being that's a witch. And the astral project and sleep with people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: That's just one of many outlandish claims made by a doctor who Donald Trump is promoting. He retreated to his 84 million followers. The doctor's incorrect claimed that the drug Hydroxychloroquine cures Coronavirus. Twitter has removed Mr. Trump's re-tweets, but Trump's sharing shows how rampant misinformation is for us all and raises questions about what tech companies are doing about it.</p><p>Well, next hour, CEOs from four of the world's most powerful and influential companies will be the focus of an historic antitrust hearing. Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook will face questions about whether they have too much control in the marketplace. Clare Sebastian has the details.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When these four CEOs come before Congress will be at remotely, it will be hard to know who is the most powerful in the room.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CICILLINE, U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: Google controls nearly all the search market in the United States, Amazon controls nearly half of all online commerce in the United States. Facebook has approximately 2.7 billion monthly active users across platforms. And finally Apple is under increasing scrutiny for abuse its role as both a player and a referee in the app stores.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: A yearlong Congressional investigation is looking for ways to check that power, and what experts say it will require a new understanding of U.S. competition law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM KOVACIC, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Major point of this hearings is to move away from a conception of competition law is focusing on the well being of citizens as purchasers of goods and services, and to take adopt a broader conception, it looks at the citizen as an employee, as a resident of a community, as a consumer of news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The four companies have all denied anti-competitive behavior--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NATHAN SUTTON, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AMAZON: We do not use any cellular data to compete with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Apple even commissioning a study last week to find its app store commission rates was in line with others. Several have also voiced concerns that regulation might make them less competitive globally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, ALPHABET &amp; GOOGLE CEO: I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it. It has a lot of unintended consequences. You know if you take a technology like artificial intelligence, it allows implications for our national security and how other important areas of society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And yet even as the COVID-19 pandemic has made these companies ever more essential and more valuable, they have been facing growing backlash, protests over safety at Amazon and an advertiser boycott of Facebook over hate speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOVACIC: I think they come into the hearing not with a halo but with great concerns about exactly whose side they're on, and that should be a matter of concern. Again, you look at the mood the Congress; you look at how Republicans joined Democrats today in scolding these companies? That's a combustible environment for the leading enterprises.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The House investigation is expected to lead to a recommendation for new legislation, perhaps bringing greatest scrutiny of tech acquisition, deals like Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google buying YouTube and Fitbit. It could also ramp up the pressure on other ongoing investigations, the delicate moment for these titans of tech. Clare Sebastian, CNN, New York.</p><p>ANDERSON: These companies shape our lives, and now more than ever, the world very lying on them to find a digital solution, for example, to the COVID-19 crisis. My next guest is skeptical about that, and he says he is concerned by the, \"Rising enthusiasm for automated technology as a centerpiece of infection control\".</p><p>Ashkan Soltani is a Former Senior Adviser in the Obama Administration and Former Chief Technology Officer for the Federal Trade Commission. He knows what he is talking about? What is the point of this hearing? Just how important is it? And are those who are there in Congress, are they qualified to cross-examine these tech titans?</p><p>[11:25:00]</p><p>ASHKAN SOLTANI, FORMER CHIEF TECH OFFICER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me. So that's a wonderful question. Two questions, really. One is I think the point of this hearing is generally to understand how these companies got to be the size they are and have the influence they have over our lives, not just in the selling of goods and services, selling of books or social things?</p><p>But also they influence the shape our opinions our media and understanding, for example, in the COVID crisis, how they're providing these tools and influencing what governments ultimately do, right? To your question of whether Congress is qualified, they made strides in the last; I want to say, five years in hiring qualified, kind of technical folks.</p><p>There's a project called Tech Congress that has brought in folks like me to help advice. But not everyone in the Congress, particularly that falls on political lines some folks don't actually rely on experts. And so we've seen that in past hearings. Hopefully this hearing will show us a little bit more that they've done their homework.</p><p>ANDERSON: So if you were advising Congress on what to ask, what are the hot button issues, and what do we need to hear from these tech titans to ensure that we feel comfortable about their size and ownership of this space that we all know - what would you be asking?</p><p>SOLTANI: Well, so in the U.S., it's not illegal to be large, even though there is a lot of concern about the size of these companies. The concern is more about did they use anti-competitive behavior to get to where they are? So for each company, there are a different set of concerns.</p><p>For example, for Apple, the focus is primarily on the app stores and the fees they charge in terms of providing the apps or developers providing apps to consumers. Apple is the gateway. Apple has also kind of been criticized for copying apps and features that others develop and assume in their operating system.</p><p>Google is different; Google has three different kind of aspects. One is Google Search and more and more we've seen with a great markup story just yesterday about how more and more of the content we see on Google Search is Google's own concept. They kind of promote their own sites and services over others.</p><p>They, in fact, sometimes steal content or take content from other search engines, maps and show it on their own sites. The second is android and more of a bundling issue. So this was quite similar to what happened with Microsoft in the 2000s where Europe actually fined Google for requiring that number of apps and services with Google apps be bundling with android.</p><p>And then the last is the ads business, right? Google is - search engine but they also operate on ads, marketplace. What's really unique about Google is they're both the marketplace, they're the broker/dealer in the stock world, but they're also a player. So similar to search they essentially provide search but they also can benefit their own products and services.</p><p>In the ads world, they provide us an ad platform, but they can benefit their own kind of ads as well. And then Facebook, the focus on Facebook is primarily on acquisitions of things like Instagram and WhatsApp and whether they use personal data or whether they use anti-competitive practices to make those acquisitions?</p><p>Facebook was criticized a few years ago for using a VPN product that they marketed even to children and teens that would essentially monitor what other apps and services were popular this is so novel and they used that to determine or that's believed to be what helped them determine whether to acquire Instagram?</p><p>And then finally with Amazon, it's a combination--</p><p>ANDERSON: --yes, go on.</p><p>SOLTANI: Just with Amazon, it's just a combination of all those factors. So Amazon, there are concerns about acquisitions of whole foods, there is concerns about anti-competitive behaviors and restrictions on sellers, and then there is this concern around the copyright kill strategy where Amazon will identify what products or services are popular on their marketplace and then recreate them. Sorry I set you off, go ahead.</p><p>ANDERSON: Right. Yes, yes, no, no. Let me stop you there because - the good thing is I want to put up the graphic that I had up while you were talking, which just shows the immense size of these companies. I know you said that size isn't illegal or isn't - shouldn't be the number one issue in the states, but it is in other places.</p><p>You come to Europe and they're a lot more aggressive when it comes to sort of their anti-competitive behavior but in the U.S. perhaps less so. But let's just have a look at this. Amazon accounts for 39 percent of U.S. online retail sales. Apple's stock market value is about $1.6 trillion.</p><p>[11:30:00]</p><p>ANDERSON: Facebook, more than 3 billion people around the world use its platform. And Google, more than 92 percent of searches happen on there. I just wonder how - when you said these Congressmen and women are in a better position these days, better qualified to go about, you know, cross- examining these titans.</p><p>But I guess my question is simply this, and I asked at the beginning. What's the point at this stage? Is anything going to change about these companies, or do you believe they'll fit in good for purpose?</p><p>SOLTANI: No absolutely, you know the thing that all of these companies have, which is different than, say, 10 or 20 years ago, is that they have immense amounts of data they can use to make strategic decisions about products, purchases, acquisitions and competition, right?</p><p>And I think slowly - Europe has some privacy laws. Slowly I think Congress is understanding the importance of restricting not just the growth and practice of these companies, but also the use of data and the ability to essentially use data to leverage and influence not just competitors, right?</p><p>We're looking at it from who might win the next selection or what candidates are shown? There is immense influence that the companies have primarily on the use of data and how they collect and present information? I think Congress is slowly getting up to speed.</p><p>And I think it's important how you laid in and out your graphic important to recognize the size and inputs that the companies have, right? In the current pandemic debate, the UK is actually currently in a battle with Google and Apple around what information they can collect for the purposes of the pandemic providing this contact tracing?</p><p>That's an incredibly kind of unique position where tech platforms are actually dictating what the government can do in response to a pandemic? That's kind of unprecedented.</p><p>ANDERSON: With that, I've got to pay for this show and get into a break. We thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.</p><p>SOLTANI: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Back after this.</p><p>ANDERSON: Just at half past 7:00 in the UAE. Welcome back. This is CONNECT THE WORLD from our Middle East Broadcasting Hub here at CNN. Kremlin observers have long said Russian President Vladimir Putin likes to be first.</p><p>[11:35:00]</p><p>Now CNN learns Russia says it intends to be first in the world to approve a Coronavirus vaccine. Moscow says it could come in less than two weeks. It insists it's even got a plan to mass-produce it in September. Russia is calling this its sputnik moment, referring to the 1950 space race the Soviet Union stolen march on the United States.</p><p>Of course, what people want to know now is will the vaccine be safe and effective? So far Russia hasn't released a syllable of scientific research. Brazil's Health Ministry says a vaccine could be ready before the New Year. Officials expect the experimental Oxford's AstraZeneca vaccine to be distributed by the end of December if it proves to be safe.</p><p>Meanwhile a new survey shows nearly half of Brazilian doctors have felt pressure to prescribe unproven medicine for COVID-19 treatment. These health workers also say that misinformation over drugs like Hydroxychloroquine have interfered with fighting the virus.</p><p>Well, if you recall the Brazilian President himself has been promoting that drug from the beginning of the pandemic. Let's discuss all of this with CNN's Nick Payton Walsh joining us live from the Brazilian Capital. You have been speaking to Brazilian doctors, what are they been telling you, Nick?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: Well that certainly you've heard too pretty much fits the picture of increasing concern here about what the consistent promotion of Hydroxychloroquine. I should stress that study after study has shown pretty much any every stage in which has delivered has no medical benefits, in fact, some studies suggest it may even be harmful.</p><p>The kind of myth around it here promoted by President Jair Bolsonaro who even held it in his hand when he declared to the world he just tested negative for Coronavirus after two weeks infected with the disease.</p><p>The concern amongst some about 60 plus percent of the doctors surveyed in Sao Paulo, one of the megacity hot spots really of this disease, is that it's distracting people from thinking about the severity of the disease here, the serious things they have to do to help themselves.</p><p>Former U.S. Surgeon General speaking to CNN yesterday it's a distraction. The survey also showed that about 50 percent of them felt pressure to give Hydroxychloroquine or other drugs that are parts of the complex being offered here or recommended here by Brazilian health officials that don't really have any proven medical effects.</p><p>Now of course, one thing to say to people will try this drug, it may possibly assist you down the line. It is not the one to do so when there is no actual proof of any medical benefit; from that one is the further problem when in fact some of these drugs may possibly have links to side effects that are harmful.</p><p>So concern certainly here in Brazil where cases are staggering tens of thousands a day, 40,000 in the last 24 hour count that we heard, at the end of last week 50,000 cases reported pretty much every 24 hours for a three- day stretch.</p><p>The concern is that this promotion of a cure that isn't a cure that is frankly full - is stopping people from focusing on masks, keeping their hands clean, social distancing, things that might actually help slow the spread, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Nick is in Brazil for you. Thank you, Nick. We are talking Coronavirus here and what we can expect to hear and see next? The COVID outbreak in Mexico is one of the worst in the world, with the country now claiming more than 400,000 infections.</p><p>The numbers aren't nearly as bad as the neighboring U.S., but more and more Mexicans crossing the border hoping for a healthcare system which is better equipped to fight the pandemic. CNN's Matt Rivers with this report.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Among those waiting outside public hospitals in Tijuana, Mexico, death is a constant companion. Dianna Lopez (ph) didn't get a chance to say goodbye to her father-in-law before the COVID-19 took him. She says imagine a family member suddenly gets hospitalized and you just never seem them again.</p><p>Tijuana and its State of Baja, California are among Mexico's hardest hit regions. For months healthcare workers have told us about overwhelmed hospitals plagued by lack of supplies. Roughly 20 percent of those diagnosed here with COVID have died. This nurse says, we were not prepared for the magnitude of what was and is the pandemic.</p><p>Tijuana sits just across that border there from the U.S. State of California. Though it's closed to all non-essential travel, if you're legally allowed to be in the U.S., be it as a citizen, permanent resident or otherwise, you can still cross, and if you want to, seek treatment at a U.S. hospital.</p><p>Which is exactly what Patricia Gonzalez-Zuniga did when her husband got the virus, the couples are dual U.S. Mexico citizens but live in Tijuana where doctor Gonzalez-Zuniga has worked for decades treating the city's poor.</p><p>[11:40:00]</p><p>RIVERS: She says the public health system is broken, so when her husband got really sick, going to the U.S. for care was an easy choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. PRACTICIA GONZALEZ-ZUNIGA, HUSBAND WAS TREATED IN THE U.S.: It's like if we stay, and maybe 50 percent chance that you will die, or just go and get services.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: At nearby Scripps Mercy Hospital in Chula Vista, California, we learn her story isn't unique. The hospital has been at or near capacity for months, in part because of patients from across the border. In July alone, it admitted more than 50 COVID patients who recently came from Mexico. The hospital says the vast majority of patients who travel from Mexico test positive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. JUAN MANUEL TOVAR, SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL CHULA VISTA: It does create stress in the system and we have to deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: Dr. Juan Manuel Tovar said at its peak 50 percent of all COVID patients at the hospital have been from south of the border, though the numbers have gone down as the new cases in Baja, California have slowed but cases in California have spiked recently. So his fear of the same happens in Mexico, a tough situation could get even worse. He says this is the border. Everything is shared culture, commerce and COVID care.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOVAR: This is one region I have no problems about seeing patients from Mexico.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: Dr. Gonzalez-Zuniga for one is extremely grateful for that fact. Her husband spent 14 days in a California ICU nearly intubated several times but he lived.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: What do you think would have happened if he had been in a public hospital in Mexico?</p><p>GONZALEZ-ZUNIGA: He would not be here. He would be dead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: She calls herself lucky and compared to the Lopez's family she is. They couldn't get care in the U.S. Maybe we could have gotten better care over there, more opportunity. But now after her father-in-law's death, that is nothing more than a hypothetical question. Matt Rivers, CNN, Tijuana, Mexico.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well the tech titans will be taking the hot seat in U.S. Congress next hour. Meanwhile, Turkey climbing down on top social media players more on it sweeping new set of regulations just ahead.</p><p>ANDERSON: We're less than half an hour away from an historic hearing in the U.S. Congress. Four of the world's most powerful CEOs are set to take the hot seat, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google facing questions about abuse of power and dominance.</p><p>Turkey tightening its grip on social media with a comprehensive and controversial social media regulation bill. New rules passed parliament today will apply to platforms that have more than 1 million Turkish users with fines of up to $1.5 million for failure to comply.</p><p>CNN's Arwa Damon connecting us to the story in Istanbul, what do we know of the details on this?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky, let's talk about those controversial details.</p><p>[11:45:00]</p><p>DAMON: First noting, though, that this still needs to be signed off by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, keeping in mind, though, that that is pretty much a foregone conclusion given his position on social media in the past.</p><p>And companies have until October to comply with these new laws if they have over 1 million local users. They will have to appoint a local representative, and they will also have to, within that vein, store the data, the local users' data locally.</p><p>Of course, that in and of itself does raise a certain number of concerns, but then they will also need to comply with the Turkish government when it requests that certain content be removed. And critics are saying that this effectively allows these large social media companies, you know, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook to become effective arms of the Turkish government, which as we well know, does not have exactly the best track record when it comes to freedom of speech and expression.</p><p>Now, the Turkish government for its part is saying this is not aimed to actually curb freedom of expression but rather to protect users, something that is, of course, being greatly disputed. Turkey is also saying they modeled this law on Germany's legislation that Germany was using to combat anti-hate speech online.</p><p>But the German legislation was already being criticized for being fought, and many critics fear this is just the Turkish government's attempt to exert even more control in a country that already is being greatly and grossly criticized for various different abuses when it comes to freedom of the media and expression, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Arwa Damon on the story for you. Arwa, thank you. A disturbing global extortion scam has Chinese students in Australia faking their own kidnappings. It's all happening virtually. Anna Coren with the story.</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As scams - Chinese students in Australia is raising alarm. We've anonymous criminals leashing families backing China of millions of dollars. New South Wales police say there has been a spate of virtual scams in recent months where criminals speaking in mandarin are contacting students pretending to be official Chinese authorities.</p><p>They then tell the students they have been implicated in a crime, and the only way to get out of it is a stage of fake kidnapping, sending photos to their families telling them they have to pay a ransom. In some cases they were threatened that their family would be hurt. The students are then told to go to a hotel turn off their phone so they couldn't be contacted by family members.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARREN BENNETT, NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE: So the people in China have got a two prong threat. They've got this photo of their loved one and they can't get in touch with their loved one. This might be tried on numerous occasions and not work frequently, but in one occasion they've actually paid the sum of more than $2 million.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COREN: There are approximately 165,000 Chinese students enrolled in Australian universities this year. That's down from usual 200,000-plus, most likely due to Coronavirus and the ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p><p>Last month China warned its students against studying in Australia, citing racism, after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for a global inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. The police say the people behind these virtual kidnappings have yet to be identified.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENNETT: It's very egregious crime type, it's very cruel, and as hard as it is to believe, with the number of calls going out, they're still finding those odd people that fall for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COREN: Police have warned students who receive these calls to hang up and notify authorities immediately. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well you're watching \"Connect the World\" with me, Becky Anderson. Over the last few months we have talked about not one, but two, viruses around the world, COVID-19 and racism. And we speak with a Premier League star next who opens up about the nonstop abuse that he receives on social media. You must have a listen to what he has to say.</p><p>[11:50:00]</p><p>ANDERSON: The CEOs from the big four tech companies are testifying before Congress in the United States today. The focus is antitrust, but there is also a lot of concern about the volume of toxic content and hate speech on the internet these days.</p><p>Don Riddell joins us now with a sobering tail of a Premier League football start and here is the experience of racist abuse on Instagram.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Becky thanks very much. The Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha says that he's now scared to look at his direct messages because of the awful racial abuse that he received. And he went public about one such message recently only to discover that the message has been sent by a 12-year-old boy. In an emotional interview, he told our Contributor Darren Lewis about the first time he experienced such abuse online.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILFRIED ZAHA, CRYSTAL PALACE FORWARD: Well, I started playing for Crystal Palace, I remember my first message. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was when I went to play against Manchester United and someone spoke about - he said black this and I hope you break your legs and go back to the slums and stuff like that. Because I felt like enough is enough, and I'm among a lot of people who have had racial abuse, and I've had racial abuse all my life, but it's a thing where for right now I've got a platform where I feel like if I can make a change, I'll try.</p><p>DARREN LEWIS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, WORLD SPORT: The most recent abuse was just two weeks ago from a 12-year-old boy banana emojis, black - images and Ku Klux Klan imagery. What was your reaction when you saw that it was just a 12-year-old child?</p><p>ZAHA: It's sad really because it's like how is a 12-year-old even thinking like that? Where does this hate come from? I understand he's a 12-year-old. It's sad that it's a 12-year-old, but you have to be held accountable for things you say. The stuff you said to me isn't just black this.</p><p>The Ku Klux Klan, I didn't even know about this when I was 12. So it was like before my game but it feared me so much because I found now that same 12-year-old boy contacted like three other players, racial abused three other players as well in my team as well. So it's not OK.</p><p>LEWIS: We've spoken to Instagram and they sent us a statement and said this. Racism is not tolerated on Facebook and Instagram. When we find content that breaks our guidelines, we will remove it and we will ban those who repeatedly break the rules. We take this issue seriously and invest billions of dollars in people and technology to help remove harmful contact at scale. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>ZAHA: Even after I reported the abuse from the 12-year-old, I got 50 - I think - I reported 50 accounts, and I got racially abused after the stuff that I got before, and it's like, what happens after that account gets dropped, they just make a new account?</p><p>I've tried to block people so many times and I've looked on Instagram for the option to block them for racial abuse, but there isn't that option there. That doesn't come up. There is harassment, there is different stuff, but there is no racial abuse option that comes up.</p><p>I feel like with everything that we do in life, with everything that we register to, we have to give some sort of I.D. So why is it not the same with Instagram? Why is it not the same with Twitter? Being for black footballers for instance being on Instagram is not even fun for us anymore.</p><p>You're not enjoying your profile because every time - I'm scared to even look at my direct messages anymore because it could be filled with anything.</p><p>[11:55:00]</p><p>ZAHA: I don't even have Twitter on my phone anymore because it's almost certain that you're going to get some sort of abuse, like especially after games and stuff, because it happens so freely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, like Instagram, Twitter released a statement to us at CNN condemning racist abuse on their platform. A spokesperson told us, \"Racist behavior has no place on Twitter and we strongly condemn it. Throughout this season we have proactively engaged and constantly collaborated with our value partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively\".</p><p>Let's bring in Darren Lewis for more on this. Darren, Zaha made it clear that on Instagram you cannot report someone for racial abuse. What has been the reaction for this interview now having been seen?</p><p>LEWIS: There's huge reaction, Don, because so many sportsmen and ordinary people have the same experience. As for Wilfried Zaha, the social media companies are very big on saying the right thing and sounding responsible, but in practice, so many people are left unprotected by the social media policies.</p><p>There is so much hate speech that is allowed on social media to go unchecked. Footballers like Wilfried Zaha have had enough. This isn't just a problem for sports and football this is a problem for life. We all need to do something about it, to use our platforms just like he is doing in order to combat it.</p><p>RIDDELL: Darren, you know I was particularly moved by this interview, because recently we've seen a lot of black players in Europe finding their voice, standing tall, defiantly calling out their abuses. He seemed really dejected. What kind of support is he getting from fellow players and athletes?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, the support he is actually getting is from his family, but there have been other players. And we discussed it during the course of the interview, who has been similarly motivated to use their platforms to speak.</p><p>We covered them here on CNN Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling and a number of other players who have said, look, the generations before have been prepared to accept this, but this generation is no longer to do that.</p><p>And while it was bananas on the field back then and monkey chanting now its banana emojis. And as he told us, Ku Klux Klan images from 12-year-olds. It is remarkable stuff and yet unremarkable because to be honest with you in many cases it are the life of a black man, and the life of a black man, Don, in football.</p><p>RIDDELL: It's just so sickening, isn't it? We must applaud Wilfried Zaha and other players now for coming forward speaking up, drawing attention to it. He's right, I'd imagine going on that platform must be very, very difficult right now, but he is using his status to speak about it and shedding some light on it. Darren Lewis thanks very much again great interview as always.</p><p>LEWIS: Thank you.</p><p>RIDDELL: Becky that's all we have got time for on the sport just now back to you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Thank you. There is no place for racism anywhere, ever, end of. If the coronavirus has taught us anything, it's that we are all in this together. Let's be good to one another. Thank you for joining us. I'm Becky Anderson at CONNECT THE WORLD. Good night and stay well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020072902cbk29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-HYR1-DXH2-6003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002L6S</classCode><className>ASTRAZENECA PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS325411 MEDICINAL &amp;

With the $5.5 billion cash-and-stock deal as sketched out last week, what began as a homegrown Google would run the gamut from search, ride-hailing and music streaming to cards and deposits. It\u2019s an accomplishment even Asia's pioneering apps-for-everything have struggled to achieve.   With added clout, though, come extra political and regulatory risks that are harder to quantify.   Being bigger isn\u2019t always easier. Prominence, even dominance, has already come at the cost of compromise for the $22 billion U.S.-listed outfit. A Kremlin-sanctioned governance overhaul agreed last year allayed official concerns with the creation of a foundation to oversee sensitive issues including the transfer of intellectual property and users\u2019 personal data.    The company also faces stiff local competition in the form of its erstwhile partner, state lender Sberbank PJSC, which has aggressively shift toward Big Tech by joining forces with  Yandex rival Mail.ru and rebranding itself Sber.    Yandex\u2019s rise has been remarkable. Founded in the 1990s, Russia\u2019s technology powerhouse has expanded dramatically in the past few years. One of few search engines to dominate its home market ahead of Google,  it combined with ride-hailing rival Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s  local arm in 2017, taking a majority stake in their tie-up. It then added a string of other businesses and now stretches into everything from education to groceries \u2014 even if the search and portal segment still makes up the bulk of revenues.    The well-flagged move into finance with a tilt at challenger bank Tinkoff has been cheered as a logical step after Yandex\u2019s split with Sberbank. Billionaire Arkady Volozh\u2019s outfit wanted control, so it makes sense to use some of the cash on its balance sheet to buy a profitable lender, rather than build one, even a reasonably pricey one at roughly four times book value. Investors initially added some $2.6 billion to the combined value of the two sides\u2019 shares \u2014 an optimistic view of future revenue benefits given a formal and detailed offer hasn\u2019t been made yet.   On paper, the attraction is clear. Growth in online advertising and ride-hailing will cool. A deal with Tinkoff parent TCS Group Holding Plc plugs the fintech hole, while allowing Yandex to leverage the outfit\u2019s consumer credit and small business focus to drive its e-commerce business, making the most of shopping habits transformed by a pandemic. Tinkoff has about 13% of the credit card market and 8% of the retail loan market in Russia, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc. In turn, the bank can cut marketing and other costs linked to bringing new customers on board \u2014 currently about a third of operating expenses.   In Asia, payments and financial services are key for would-be superapps like Southeast Asia\u2019s Grab and Go-Jek, Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat and even Korean messenger app Kakao, which has had success with Kakao Bank. Still, by adding one of the world\u2019s largest digital banks to its stable, Yandex arguably goes further than all of them, testing the limits of the superapp model.   Next, Yandex has to successfully manage the growing pains that come with that in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.   With its rejig last year, Volozh nimbly circumvented a law that would have limited foreign ownership, and Yandex\u2019s public service during the pandemic will help. But concerns over sovereignty and internet data are not going away, especially given Russia\u2019s increasingly prickly relations with the West. That may complicate any efforts to list its ride-hailing arm, part-owned by Uber. Cyber sovereignty will certainly limit expansion abroad if China\u2019s tech experience abroad is anything to go by.   At home, Yandex is already walking a fine line between netizens and a heavy-handed Kremlin, with virtual protests held using its maps and navigation apps during lockdown as an example. The company later said it removes messages not related to road conditions. And that\u2019s all before adding in the extra scrutiny that bank owners can expect.   There\u2019s extra competition too as Chinese taxi giant Didi Chuxing motors into Russia.  Even pesky competitors can be costly \u2014 ask Uber.   Finally, there\u2019s the risk that a move-fast-and-add-businesses mantra turns Yandex into something more akin to Japan\u2019s jumbled Rakuten, rather than Google or Tencent, with a conglomerate discount to match. Fintech makes sense, but does music streaming? Can Yandex create value developing shows for its streaming video platform? As importantly, can its management team stretch across its various early-stage businesses, a growing online shopping operation and more, while folding in a bank?   Yandex has plenty of ambition. It will need to prove that the financial benefits match.   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Zharov made this known at the St. </p><p>Petersburg International Economic Forum[1]. Among the items constituting the new regulations is that Big Tech companies should have their servers and data physically located in Russia, failure to do so, though the new bill has not been passed to law, will attract very big fines. According to Zharov, the bill is almost ready and that he, personally, hoped it would be made law soon. The other part that the new law will impose fines for on companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google is when they violate Russian laws around the handling of users' personal data. The latest development is not peculiar to Russia as more African countries are having data centers created. It is believed that hosting locally made servers and data centers are pertinent as it will go a long way to protect the data sovereignty of these countries.Furthermore, as is the case with Russia, it means states can be able to take Big Tech companies to account legally if they fail to comply with local information protection laws. Russia had clamped down on Linkedin in the country in 2016 after the business and employment-oriented service declined to store data on its Russian users on servers hosted in Russia. More recently, Russia's communications regulator put together a database called the Register of Information Dissemination Organizations (ORI). According to reports, the database of 176 online services from around the world was made public when Russian authorities requested online dating service, Tinder, to hand over data on some Russian users. Tinder had refused the request.  The post Russia to Impose Hefty Fines on Big Tech Companies That Flout its Data Regulations[2] appeared first on Innovation Village[3].

This is then analysed to aggregate people into groups, and to make predictions about their interests and characteristics - primarily so they can use these insights to generate advertising revenue. The report found that the scale of harvesting and monetising of personal data by these platforms is incompatible with people's right to privacy.</p><p>Even though the main calls in the report are to governments and how they must regulate the industry, it behoves us all to look at the roles we play.</p><p>At Amnesty, we are just as dependent on these platforms as big corporations, political parties, and local businesses in order to reach, engage and grow our audiences. The pervasive power of these platforms is exactly why Amnesty has brought out a report on them.</p><p>What are our options? We cannot vacate them. They aren't just the public square any more. They are the main street and business district. They could become your doctor's surgery and your bank. They are the whole darn town and village.</p><p>Taking our work off Facebook and Google right now would therefore be bad for human rights as it would hamper our ability to spread our message. There simply is no other viable alternative to reach the public.</p><p>For the time being then, the most ethical thing we can do is be open about our dilemma and what we are doing about it. We'll keep talking with our audiences about this.</p><p>I've heard people within the advertising industry say that no alternative can emerge to Facebook and Googles' hegemony. What this ignores is that Silicon Valley is built on the romance of entrepreneurs starting in their garages. Something else may well be built in the months and years to come, especially if government creates the right environment for it.</p><p>That should be a spur to the tech giants to reform. They were once catalysts for freedom, playing major roles in the toppling of dictators. They played on this upstart quality for a long time. Now they are seen as part of a nexus of big corporate and political interests. This will bring in the cash in the short-term, but it does also open up the possibility for new entrants.</p><p>There will be many like Amnesty who are grappling with this conundrum. We are trying to pull off the difficult balancing act of carrying out our duty to spread our human rights message while spending money with companies profiting from problematic surveillance. The reputational risk grows with every scandal.</p><p>There are a lot of vested interests in how big tech currently works. Given they also operate extensive lobbying efforts on the very governments that should take action on them, there is every reason to think they can't self-regulate. This is why we have also set up a taskforce to look at what future options may exist to reach and engage communities. We want to speak with people across the sector to think big. Please get in touch if you think you can help.</p><p>This is a tough hill to climb. We do it while holding our nose with one hand and holding a placard calling for reform with the other.</p><p>We'd love to hear your thoughts - what will the future of public engagement look like in years to come?</p><p>Source: Russian News Agency</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK1-9931-JB5P-J401-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Please get in touch if you think you can help.</p><p>This is a tough hill to climb.

The movie financier-producer \u2014 once a media darling turned pariah after his Relativity Media ended up in bankruptcy, twice \u2014 swore three years ago he was leaving Hollywood and never coming back. Turns out he changed his mind. </p><p>(Hollywood often has that effect on people.) Always one to zig when others zag, and by anyone's measure one of the most charming salesmen Hollywood has ever produced, Kavanaugh is back with a new company called Proxima and a big deal he says is worth $250 million to make American films in China. Which is weird enough, since this news arrives just as China and the U.S. are in the midst of a massive trade war and as movie coproductions involving the two countries have stagnated for at least two years. With relations between the two world powers at a low ebb, Kavanaugh said he's found a point of entry in Hong Kong, the former British territory now under the authority of Beijing but with a Western-style approach to business. Hong Kong wants to get on the map as a cultural hub, and a recent adjustment to Chinese regulations allows movies made there to be distributed in China without regard to any quotas on overseas content. Also Read: Ryan Kavanaugh's New Company Announces $250 Million Injection for US Film Production[1] I spoke to Kavanaugh by phone on Thursday after he'd spent a day touring the China's National Arts Studio, a physical studio boasting a 100-square-mile ranch an hour from Hong Kong in which he said he's becoming a 25% stakeholder. He was joined on his tour by Carrie Lam, a politician who has served as Hong Kong's chief executive since 2017, to negotiate what terms the government would give the studio to help catapult it to premiere tourist status, providing infrastructure and other incentives to boost plans for a major theme park. 'We'll have a studio for the first time that doubles as a home where you can make a $100 million movie from beginning through postproduction that will cost 30% less than shooting anywhere else,' Kavanaugh said, with his trademark excitement over a new deal on the horizon. He said that movies shot in Hong Kong, even fully American productions, now fall outside the 34-movie quota for U.S.-made films. 'If it's a Hong Kong-based production, it falls out of quota. It's automatically accepted as a Chinese production. Any movie we make there, because it's based in Hong Kong, it's accepted in the Chinese system,' he said. 'That saves money for the Americans, creates jobs for China, creates production revenue in China and American revenue by means of the box office and other windows. Everyone wins. Amidst this crazy trade war, this is a way that everyone can win.' Also Read: Ryan Kavanaugh Files $50 Million Suit Against Ex-Relativity Exec Over 'Misleading' Arbitration Leak (Exclusive)[2] A lot has happened since Relativity threw in the towel to bankruptcy three years ago. Harvey Weinstein, the industry's other swashbuckling maverick, has been disgraced (and awaits a criminal trial). Disney and Fox have merged and become an overwhelmingly dominant force in the studio system. Netflix has become a behemoth. Independent studios like Open Road have failed. The flood of Hollywood executives going to China three and four years ago has slowed to a trickle. There is less room for a charming rogue like Kavanaugh in a new Hollywood dominated by corporate number-crunchers and big tech. But Kavanaugh has a knack for convincing people, particularly those with deep pockets, to follow him. And while a lot of people have announced plans in China that never came to pass, he's as convincing as he's ever been that he's going to make it work this time. As for coming back to Hollywood?

Fintechs and the future of banking</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Basel: Bank for International Settlements has issued the following speech:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Statement by Ms Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, at an ECB Fintech Workshop, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will never know who did it and when exactly it was done - all of that is lost in the mists of time. But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of these innovations have made our life better - just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact - think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.</p><p>As the President of IBM said in 1943: 'I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.' He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that 'the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.'</p><p>The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.</p><p>It's true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks - at least in some parts of the value chain.</p><p>The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.</p><p>Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.</p><p>Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.</p><p>Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.</p><p>Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.</p><p>A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.</p><p>At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.</p><p>With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly - banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge - just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.</p><p>Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don't know how well they would work in such situations.</p><p>In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.</p><p>And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone - banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.</p><p>There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of 'same business, same risks, same rules'. That is important.</p><p>As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.</p><p>We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshop today serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Such exchanges are vital.</p><p>I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-AIFN19767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NC7-07G1-F0YC-N26B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 29, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>IBM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>IBM (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Basel II Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDkyNjY0QTZDN0IyNDA2MDhBMjI2RDZBQTcxRjFGOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTJGODhGMjg1MkU5NERDNDlCRERENzlDQTg0RTc0QTM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Loan Review Risk Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OURGMDU0NjdBMjRCNDc1MkE3ODQ1QjQ0MzZDRjlFMDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0YzM0JGNzQ2OEE2NDk3OUFCMzM3MUU4QTYxNTEwNTY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;
