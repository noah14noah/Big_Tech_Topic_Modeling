However, legal experts said neither agency may have the appropriate authority to take those actions.</p><p>FCC authority</p><p>Mitchell Brecher, a shareholder at the law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP, who focuses his practice on telecommunication, media law and regulation, said in an interview that the Communications Act of 1934   the federal law that established the FCC and the legal framework for regulating many forms of communication   does not appear to give the FCC authority to regulate edge providers, such as Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC.</p><p>\"The Communications Act is pretty clear what the FCC has jurisdiction over   anybody that uses the spectrum, broadcast stations, anyone that provides telecommunications services, anyone that manufactures devices to transmit radio energy   I don't think edge providers fit within any of those categories,\" he said, adding that an executive order \"can't create authority\" for a regulatory body.</p><p>President Donald Trump speaks during a White House social media summit in July. Source: The Associated Press</p><p>Rob Frieden, a telecommunications law professor at Pennsylvania State University, said the executive order, as described, sounds like an attempt to create an internet version of the Fairness Doctrine, a former FCC policy that required broadcasters to give equal air time to opposing views on controversial issues.</p><p>An attempt to create a Fairness Doctrine for the internet \"just reeks of First Amendment problems,\" according to Frieden, who previously worked at the FCC and the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p><p>\"It's just unconstitutional and how would you enforce it?\" said Frieden. \"And how do you determine fairness?\"</p><p>FTC powers</p><p>Brecher also does not see appropriate authority for the FTC, which is, in part, charged with overseeing unfair and deceptive practices in commerce.</p><p>\"The way I read the Federal Trade Commission Act, there is a difference between an unfair and deceptive practice   a practice that's going to rip off consumers or mislead consumers about a product   and political commentary,\" he said. \"I don't think that controlling the substantive content of information that's put out by edge providers comes within the jurisdiction of the FTC, unless that information is unfair and [a] deceptive trade practice.\"</p><p>Frieden also noted that, historically, the FTC has been an agency that reacts to issues where they receive a high volume of complaints, but the draft order, as described, would call for the agency to take a \"much more aggressive, proactive role.\"</p><p>Legal battles</p><p>If the White House does ultimately go through with the executive order in the manner being reported, Brecher sees a legal battle ahead.</p><p>Specifically, he said that if the FCC issues a new rule to implement the provisions of the executive order, the rulemaking is open to an appeal. Brecher said the primary basis for an appeal most likely would be that the agency exceeded its statutory authority.</p><p>Ultimately, due to the legal challenges such an order could face, Frieden is skeptical that the White House will move forward with it.</p><p>\"I think it got some good headlines,\" he said. \"But, this isn t the way you do it.

Iran, North Korea, Russia all in focus.  We'll have the latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ALISON KOSIK, CNN ANCHOR:  And the crown has been taken from the now- former king of cable news.  Bill O'Reilly ousted at Fox.  What's next for him and the network following another rough departure?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome back to EARLY START.  I'm Alison Kosik.  Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BRIGGS:  And I'm Dave Briggs.  It is 30 minutes past the hour.  This morning, the Trump administration not backing off the tough talk and several fights it is waging around the world with Iran, North Korea, and with Russia.  On the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.</p><p> KOSIK:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying the deal forced by the Obama administration and U.S. allies \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel.  An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KOSIK:  Tillerson's comments coming a day after he certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the deal but questions whether sanctions shouldn't be reimposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Now, you heard there Sec. Tillerson mentioning North Korea, which already has sky-high tensions with its neighbors and with the U.S.  Today, American and South Korean forces are conducting their annual Max Thunder drill.  That's the second-largest military aviation exercise on the Korean Peninsula.  CNN's Paula Hancocks is at the Kunsan Air Base in Seoul.  She has an up-close look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Dave and Alison, this is Max Thunder.  This is a massive air operation between the United States and South Korea here in South Korea.  There's more than 80 aircraft involved in this, there's more than 1,500 people.  We know that it's routine.  We know that it's annual.  </p><p> We're told by the Lt. Colonel in charge that when they're actually carrying out these drills they don't have a specific enemy in mind. But, of course, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula this is inevitably going to be more in the spotlight -- this kind of massive firepower being seen by North Korea as well.  It is not what North Korea likes to see.  Every single year when these drills happen they become angry and infuriated.  They believe that this is actually a dress rehearsal for an invasion, even though the United States say that they are defensive in nature.  </p><p> But just bear in mind what's happening on the Peninsula at this point. North Korea has said that the U.S. has pushed the situation to the point where a nuclear war could break out at any time.  China, as well, has suggested these military drills should not be happening, saying that if the U.S. holds these military drills, potentially, North Korea could suspend their nuclear and missile program.  It's not a new situation, it's not a new suggestion, and it's not one that the U.S. welcomes.  Dave, Alison, back to you.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRIGGS:  You've got that right.  Great reporting from Paula Hancocks. To help us with some perspective now, let's bring in \"CNN POLITICS\" reporter Tal Kopan.  She's live in Washington this morning.  Good morning to you, Tal.</p><p> KOSIK:  Good morning, Tal.</p><p> TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER:  Good morning.</p><p> BRIGGS:  All right, could be much ado about nothing but a lot being made of what President Trump said about this armada -- the aircraft carrier sailing to the Korean Peninsula.  And here is the president and Sean Spicer defending his actions despite the fact that we know that ship was sailing in the opposite direction at the time the president said this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are sending an armada -- very powerful.  We have submarines -- very powerful.  Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you.</p><p> SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The statement that was put out was that the Carl Vinson group was headed to the Korean Peninsula. It is headed to the Korean Peninsula.  It will arrive there --</p><p> REPORTER:  It's headed there now, though, Sean. SPICER:  What's that?</p><p> REPORTER:  It's headed there now.  It wasn't headed there last week.</p><p> SPICER:  Sure -- no, no, but that's not -- but that's not what we ever said.  We said that it was heading there, and it was heading there. It is heading there.</p><p> REPORTER:  Does the president believe that he might have spoken too quickly on this location of the vessel before it was actually arriving?</p><p> SPICER:  The president said that we have an armada going towards the Peninsula.  That's a fact, it happened.  It is happening, rather.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  All right, let me try and settle the semantic debate here because the president said \"we are sending.\"  That is, technically, true.  Nothing there is false on that statement.  But what is the problem that the administration at the Pentagon may have in regard to this whole situation?</p><p> KOPAN:  Yes, Dave, that's right.  There -- in foreign policy there's a bit more precision required than on the campaign trail, and I think that's what President Donald Trump is sort of -- is gathering on the job.  He -- if there's one thing he's known for it's not necessarily sticking to the script.  But typically, in foreign policy, every word that a president says is parsed by our allies and our enemies alike, and so that's sort of what he's dealing with at the same time.</p><p> [05:35:18]  There are definitely supporters of Trump who believe that being a bit unpredictable, and hard to pin down, and unscripted actually keeps our allies and enemies on their toes and that's sort of the appeal of the Trump foreign policy.  So, you know, that's perhaps one of the explanations for it but you are seeing the White House having to clean up after the fact and explain what the U.S. is actually doing versus what the president is saying.</p><p> BRIGGS:  That's a great point about precision.  Really well put, Tal.</p><p> KOSIK:  And speaking of foreign policy, Iran sort of was -- sort of landed on the table yesterday by Rex Tillerson.  Yesterday or the day before, Tillerson certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal hashed out by the Obama administration, but now it looks like the Trump administration is questioning whether sanctions should be imposed again on Iran.  So you have the Trump administration looking to change things in Iran, looking to change things in North Korea, looking to change things in Syria, and we're coming up against that 100-day mark for the Trump administration.  This is coming fast and furious.  Is there some sort of timeclock happening?  Why should all of this be happening this quickly?</p><p> KOPAN:  Well, you know, I think it's a few things going on, Alison.  I mean, to one point, on the 100-day mark the Trump administration is grappling with what they have to show for their first 100 days.  It's sort of an artificial deadline but they certainly don't have a lot of wins on the domestic front.  There's also been a lot of scrutiny of Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley and the various foreign policy players in the administration and whether they're visible enough, so there's been a lot of attention on this.</p><p> But, you know, it's also just, again, a matter of the reality of governing.  On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and, you know, when you get into office some of those things are not that easy.  And so, while there's absolutely serious hotspots in the world that demand immediate attention, the administration is still sorting out exactly what their strategy is going to be in regards to some of those potential flashpoints.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Another thing they'd like to tear up is Obamacare.  That was certainly one of the central promises of the Trump campaign but running into the realities of that, it's been difficult.  Mike Pence talked about this with Dana Bash and said that it's still on the hot burner.  They'd like to get details maybe and a vote next week.  </p><p> And this morning in \"The New York Times\" an editorial that's titled \"The Plan to Sabotage Obamacare.\"  This has to do with funding the exchanges, which is really the central battle here regarding the future of Obamacare.  \"It is not surprising that Mr. Trump would see the subsidies as a bargaining chip.  Governing, to him, is a matter of quick-hit deals, and he shows no concern about gambling with the health of millions of people.  This isn't Mr. Trump's promised insurance for everybody.  It sounds more like a two-bit Hollywood villain promising carnage if he doesn't get his way.\"</p><p> This is so central, Tal, because if they don't fund them Obamacare crumbles.  If they do, it could survive.  Where does this debate move next?</p><p> KOPAN:  Well, I think this is an example of when lawmakers focus on political posturing as opposed to, necessarily, policy.  The calculation is, and you hear this in the rhetoric from the White House and from Trump himself, of who owns Obamacare.  If some sort of problem happens in the marketplace, if Americans feel that their health care is getting worse or not good enough, who do they blame? And, Republicans have tried to say you know what, if we don't fix this, then Democrats it's on you for passing this bill.  </p><p> This type of threat from the Trump administration saying they won't fund something or support the bill, that's the type of thing that can shift the blame onto them and gives Democrats ammunition to say no, you had the opportunity to prop this up and you undermined it.  So there's a little bit of gamesmanship going on on top of the very difficult, sometimes non-productive discussions about what Republicans actually want to do in terms of repeal and replace.</p><p> KOSIK:  OK.</p><p> BRIGGS:  It's funding the government, which they have to do by next Friday.</p><p> KOPAN:  Yes, they do. KOSIK:  All right, I want to pivot to Bill O'Reilly, not so much about the details of what's going on there but more about Bill O'Reilly's impact on politics.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.</p><p> KOSIK:  And it certainly harkens back to earlier this month when President Trump came out actually defending Bill O'Reilly in a \"New York Times\" article.  This is on April 5th.  He said, \"I know Bill. Bill's a good person.  I don't think Bill would do anything wrong.\" What's behind this defense coming from Donald Trump?  I mean, if you think about Bill O'Reilly, you know, he sort of created this movement, didn't he?  And many think that if there was no Bill O'Reilly there would be no President Donald Trump.</p><p> [05:40:00]  KOPAN:  Well, these two men go back quite a ways and Donald Trump and Fox News go back quite a ways.  As he began -- Trump, as he began to craft his sort of conservative persona over the last several years, Fox was a key platform for that.  He would call in frequently and talk to them.  And even throughout the campaign and the beginning of his presidency, O'Reilly was one of his sort of key stops when he tried to sell his message.  </p><p> And then, on top of that, you get into sort of the theory of conservatism and populism and how Fox News and O'Reilly, in particular, really sort of pioneered that style.  Certainly, you know, the Trump effect owes quite a bit to that groundwork.  And, you know, it was a little bit odd when that statement came out with Trump defending Bill O'Reilly so strongly given the accusations against him. Given some of the history of the campaign trail and the infamous tape that came out about Donald Trump, it dredged up a lot of that.  But, you know, Trump -- he felt very loyal to Bill O'Reilly and really showed that sort of sense of fealty in that statement.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Well, those two have been friends for decades.  It was a good question, though.  Would we have President Trump if we didn't have Bill O'Reilly?  A lot to get to.  Tal Kopan, thanks so much --</p><p> KOSIK:  Thanks, Tal.</p><p> BRIGGS:  -- for being with us this morning from Washington.</p><p> KOPAN:  Thank you.</p><p> BRIGGS:  More details now on that move rocking the world of cable news.  As we've been telling you, Bill O'Reilly, the top-rated host of Fox News' flagship show, \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" is out.  The network canceling O'Reilly's show amid growing public pressure and an advertiser boycott as years of sexual harassment claims piled up.  The announcement came from 21st Century Fox chief Rupert Murdoch and his sons.</p><p> BRIGGS:  In a note to the company they paid tribute to O'Reilly's ratings and accomplishments, but also underlined the company's commitment to fostering a work environment \"built on the values of trust and respect.\" BRIGGS:  Fox's decision to force O'Reilly out marks a stunning about- face for a company that stood by the superstar host through years of sometimes tawdry allegations.  But after Fox News chairman Roger Ailes resigned last summer under a cloud of similar claims, momentum seemed to shift against the seemingly untouchable host.  </p><p> O'Reilly wished the network well on his way out as he defended his honor in a statement.  \"Over the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history.  It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims, but that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\"</p><p> It's unclear whether O'Reilly is getting a big payout.  He may be owed tens of millions of dollars but it's also possible his new contract contains clauses allowing Fox to get out of a deal.  Stay with us. We'll have much more on this story in the next half hour in \"NEW DAY\". </p><p> All right, some breaking news now.  General Motors pulling out of Venezuela after its plant there was unexpectedly seized by authorities, a move the automaker calls illegal.  GM says it plans to fight back legally and, meantime, will make severance payments to its thousands of Venezuelan employees.  GM's decision won't help the worsening economic crisis there, though.  </p><p> The country racked by huge anti-government protests demanding elections, denouncing critical food shortages, and what demonstrators call an increasingly authoritarian government.  One Venezuelan National Guard sergeant shot and killed in the protest yesterday.  Two civilians were killed and hundreds of people arrested.</p><p> KOSIK:  Those pictures are just incredible.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Utter chaos there in Venezuela.</p><p> KOSIK:  Amazing.  All right, big cuts at the EPA.  Why, and what's the broader impact?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [05:47:50]  KOSIK:  Welcome back.  The Environmental Protection Agency plans to reduce its workforce.  That's according to an internal memo obtain by CNN and it shows the EPA will offer buyouts and an early retirement program to some workers.  The agency will also maintain a hiring freeze with very limited exceptions, even as the government- wide ban expires.  </p><p> Three hundred and fifty jobs went unfilled at the EPA under the Trump administration's hiring freeze and no new positions could be created. The union that represents EPA employees says the administration wants to cut between 3,000 and 4,000 full-time positions.  That would be more than 25 percent of its workforce.  The EPA has not responded to a CNN request for comment.</p><p> All right, time for a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY.\"  Chris Cuomo joins us.  Good morning to you, my friend.</p><p> CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR, \"NEW DAY\":  Good morning.  How are you, Alison Kosik?</p><p> KOSIK:  Good.</p><p> CUOMO:  We have much more on Bill O'Reilly's exit from Fox News. We're going to talk to people who shared a set with him.  What effect does this make on Fox News as a political culture there?  What about as a professional culture there, and is that going to change even if Bill O'Reilly is gone?  </p><p> Now, there's another political implication to O'Reilly being gone. What does this mean for President Trump?  I'm not talking about his support of Bill O'Reilly but you have to remember how formative, how important Bill O'Reilly was in the development, introduction, and motivation of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate.</p><p> Also, on the other side of the aisle, the book that's making waves. It's called \"Shattered\" and it details what went wrong in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.  We have the authors on and we're going to get their reaction to the fierce criticism now coming from the Clinton camp.  That will all be on \"NEW DAY.\"</p><p> KOSIK:  OK, that's good.  I will be watching.</p><p> CUOMO:  Thank you.</p><p> KOSIK:  Good to see you.  All right, some more bad headlines for Wells Fargo this morning.  Federal regulators had at least 700 chances to stop the fake account scandal, but failed.  We're going to explain when we get a check on CNN Money Stream, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [05:54:05]  KOSIK:  Congressman Jason Chaffetz, the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announcing he will not seek reelection in 2018.  The Utah Republican insisting he has no ulterior motives and simply wants to return to the private sector back home in Utah.  Chaffetz is best known for heading up the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as Secretary of State. He has, in the past, expressed an interest in becoming governor of Utah.</p><p> The Syrian government now seeking shelter for its combat planes following the U.S. missile strike earlier this month.  That strike in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack the U.S. says Syria launched on its own people.  CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr has the details.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Dave, Alison, the U.S. missile strike in Syria now reverberating across the Syrian military. That missile strike took out about 20 percent of Syria's operational fighter jets and now the Syrians have apparently moved most of the rest of their inventory to a base along the coast quite close to the Russians, looking for that Russian umbrella of protection with Russian anti-air systems, Russian missiles.  They may keep the Syrian aircraft but they can still launch additional attacks using their helicopters, artillery, and rockets.  </p><p> [05:55:25]  So, while the Syrians may think that they have solved their problem there is no indication yet that the Trump administration is calling it a day on any future attacks against the Syrians if they use chemical weapons again -- Alison, Dave.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KOSIK:  OK, Barbara Starr, thanks very much.  The U.S.-led coalition reporting a dramatic increase in ISIS' use of chemical weapons in Iraq.  According to U.S. Defense officials there have been at least four incidents in the last week of ISIS fighters using chemical weapons, including mustard gas in Mosul.  No deaths or coalition casualties have resulted from the attacks.</p><p> New military conduct regulations ban Navy and Marine personnel from distributing nude photos without the permission of the person depicted.  The new rule effectively making any violation a crime that could be punished by a military court.  It comes on the heels of a nude photo -- a nude photo-sharing scandal that's rocked all four branches of the military with photos of naked female service members being posted on Marines United and other private Facebook sites.  </p><p> An attorney hired by the family of Aaron Hernandez says he will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the disgraced former NFL star.  Corrections officials say Hernandez was found hanged in his prison cell Wednesday morning, an apparent suicide.  His death coming just days after he was acquitted in a double murder case. Hernandez was already serving a life sentence without parole for the killing of Odin Lloyd.  The Massachusetts chief medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.</p><p> All right, let's get a check on CNN Money Stream right now.  Stock futures pointing higher this morning.  Shares in Europe are mixed and stock markets in Asia closed mostly higher overnight.  And this corporate earnings season -- first quarter earnings season kind of off to a rocky start.  </p><p> Shares of IBM falling off a cliff, sinking almost five percent, and that was after the company reported that it beat profit estimates. But revenue missing badly here and investors dumping the stock as a result.  IBM is one of the first big tech companies to report so investors are really going to be closely watching the sector over the next few weeks.  </p><p> Big Blue weighed on the Dow, though, dragging the average to its second straight triple-digit loss.  Look at the Nasdaq, though.  It's up for the week.  The S&amp;P 500, flat.</p><p> A troubling government report on Wells Fargo showing regulators failed to act on hundreds, if not thousands, of red flags.  That, according to an internal review published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  One alarming red flag that went unheeded, in January 2010 the regulator was aware of 700 cases of whistleblower complaints about Wells Fargo's failed tactics.  The report says regulators failed to confront executives or the company's board of directors, and it says the board knew about aggressive sales practices as early as 2004. Wells Fargo declined to comment.</p><p> All right, thanks for joining us.

What's next for him and the network following another rough departure?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Alison Kosik. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIGGS: And I'm Dave Briggs. It is 30 minutes past the hour. This morning, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>not backing off the tough talk and several fights it is waging around the world with Iran, North Korea, and with Russia. On the Iran nuclear deal, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.</p><p>KOSIK: <person><nameText>Secretary of State </nameText></person><person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>saying the deal forced by the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>and U.S. allies \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>REX TILLERSON, </nameText></person><person><nameText>SECRETARY OF STATE</nameText></person>: Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel. An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK: Tillerson's comments coming a day after he certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the deal but questions whether sanctions shouldn't be reimposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, you heard there Sec. Tillerson mentioning North Korea, which already has sky-high tensions with its neighbors and with the U.S. Today, American and South Korean forces are conducting their annual Max Thunder drill. That's the second-largest military aviation exercise on the Korean Peninsula. CNN's Paula Hancocks is at the Kunsan Air Base in Seoul. She has an up-close look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Dave and Alison, this is Max Thunder. This is a massive air operation between the United States and South Korea here in South Korea. There's more than 80 aircraft involved in this, there's more than 1,500 people. We know that it's routine. We know that it's annual.</p><p>We're told by the Lt. Colonel in charge that when they're actually carrying out these drills they don't have a specific enemy in mind. But, of course, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula this is inevitably going to be more in the spotlight -- this kind of massive firepower being seen by North Korea as well. It is not what North Korea likes to see. Every single year when these drills happen they become angry and infuriated. They believe that this is actually a dress rehearsal for an invasion, even though the United States say that they are defensive in nature.</p><p>But just bear in mind what's happening on the Peninsula at this point. North Korea has said that the U.S. has pushed the situation to the point where a nuclear war could break out at any time. China, as well, has suggested these military drills should not be happening, saying that if the U.S. holds these military drills, potentially, North Korea could suspend their nuclear and missile program. It's not a new situation, it's not a new suggestion, and it's not one that the U.S. welcomes. Dave, Alison, back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: You've got that right. Great reporting from Paula Hancocks. To help us with some perspective now, let's bring in \"CNN POLITICS\" reporter Tal Kopan. She's live in Washington this morning. Good morning to you, Tal.</p><p>KOSIK: Good morning, Tal.</p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, could be much ado about nothing but a lot being made of what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said about this armada -- the aircraft carrier sailing to the Korean Peninsula. And here is the president and <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>defending his actions despite the fact that we know that ship was sailing in the opposite direction at the time the president said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are sending an armada -- very powerful. We have submarines -- very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you.</p><p><person><nameText>SEAN SPICER, </nameText></person>WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The statement that was put out was that the Carl Vinson group was headed to the Korean Peninsula. It is headed to the Korean Peninsula. It will arrive there --</p><p>REPORTER: It's headed there now, though, <person><nameText>Sean. SPICER</nameText></person>: What's that?</p><p>REPORTER: It's headed there now. It wasn't headed there last week.</p><p>SPICER: Sure -- no, no, but that's not -- but that's not what we ever said. We said that it was heading there, and it was heading there. It is heading there.</p><p>REPORTER: Does the president believe that he might have spoken too quickly on this location of the vessel before it was actually arriving?</p><p>SPICER: The president said that we have an armada going towards the Peninsula. That's a fact, it happened. It is happening, rather.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, let me try and settle the semantic debate here because the president said \"we are sending.\" That is, technically, true. Nothing there is false on that statement. But what is the problem that the administration at the Pentagon may have in regard to this whole situation?</p><p>KOPAN: Yes, Dave, that's right. There -- in foreign policy there's a bit more precision required than on the campaign trail, and I think that's what President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is sort of -- is gathering on the job. He -- if there's one thing he's known for it's not necessarily sticking to the script. But typically, in foreign policy, every word that a president says is parsed by our allies and our enemies alike, and so that's sort of what he's dealing with at the same time.</p><p>[05:35:18] There are definitely supporters of Trump who believe that being a bit unpredictable, and hard to pin down, and unscripted actually keeps our allies and enemies on their toes and that's sort of the appeal of the Trump foreign policy. So, you know, that's perhaps one of the explanations for it but you are seeing the White House having to clean up after the fact and explain what the U.S. is actually doing versus what the president is saying.</p><p>BRIGGS: That's a great point about precision. Really well put, Tal.</p><p>KOSIK: And speaking of foreign policy, Iran sort of was -- sort of landed on the table yesterday by <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson. </nameText></person>Yesterday or the day before, Tillerson certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal hashed out by the <person><nameText>Obama administration, </nameText></person>but now it looks like the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is questioning whether sanctions should be imposed again on Iran. So you have the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>looking to change things in Iran, looking to change things in North Korea, looking to change things in Syria, and we're coming up against that 100-day mark for the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>This is coming fast and furious. Is there some sort of timeclock happening? Why should all of this be happening this quickly?</p><p>KOPAN: Well, you know, I think it's a few things going on, Alison. I mean, to one point, on the 100-day mark the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is grappling with what they have to show for their first 100 days. It's sort of an artificial deadline but they certainly don't have a lot of wins on the domestic front. There's also been a lot of scrutiny of <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>and Nikki Haley and the various foreign policy players in the administration and whether they're visible enough, so there's been a lot of attention on this.</p><p>But, you know, it's also just, again, a matter of the reality of governing. On the campaign trail, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>promised to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and, you know, when you get into office some of those things are not that easy. And so, while there's absolutely serious hotspots in the world that demand immediate attention, the administration is still sorting out exactly what their strategy is going to be in regards to some of those potential flashpoints.</p><p>BRIGGS: Another thing they'd like to tear up is Obamacare. That was certainly one of the central promises of the Trump campaign but running into the realities of that, it's been difficult. <person><nameText>Mike Pence </nameText></person>talked about this with Dana Bash and said that it's still on the hot burner. They'd like to get details maybe and a vote next week.</p><p>And this morning in \"The New York Times\" an editorial that's titled \"The Plan to Sabotage Obamacare.\" This has to do with funding the exchanges, which is really the central battle here regarding the future of Obamacare. \"It is not surprising that Mr. Trump would see the subsidies as a bargaining chip. Governing, to him, is a matter of quick-hit deals, and he shows no concern about gambling with the health of millions of people. This isn't Mr. Trump's promised insurance for everybody. It sounds more like a two-bit Hollywood villain promising carnage if he doesn't get his way.\"</p><p>This is so central, Tal, because if they don't fund them Obamacare crumbles. If they do, it could survive. Where does this debate move next?</p><p>KOPAN: Well, I think this is an example of when lawmakers focus on political posturing as opposed to, necessarily, policy. The calculation is, and you hear this in the rhetoric from the White House and from Trump himself, of who owns Obamacare. If some sort of problem happens in the marketplace, if Americans feel that their health care is getting worse or not good enough, who do they blame? And, Republicans have tried to say you know what, if we don't fix this, then Democrats it's on you for passing this bill.</p><p>This type of threat from the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>saying they won't fund something or support the bill, that's the type of thing that can shift the blame onto them and gives Democrats ammunition to say no, you had the opportunity to prop this up and you undermined it. So there's a little bit of gamesmanship going on on top of the very difficult, sometimes non-productive discussions about what Republicans actually want to do in terms of repeal and replace.</p><p>KOSIK: OK.</p><p>BRIGGS: It's funding the government, which they have to do by next Friday.</p><p>KOPAN: Yes, they do. KOSIK: All right, I want to pivot to <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly, </nameText></person>not so much about the details of what's going on there but more about <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly's</nameText></person> impact on politics.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>KOSIK: And it certainly harkens back to earlier this month when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>came out actually defending <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>in a \"New York Times\" article. This is on April 5th. He said, \"I know Bill. Bill's a good person. I don't think Bill would do anything wrong.\" What's behind this defense coming from <person><nameText>Donald Trump? </nameText></person>I mean, if you think about <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly, </nameText></person>you know, he sort of created this movement, didn't he? And many think that if there was no <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>there would be no President <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>[05:40:00] KOPAN: Well, these two men go back quite a ways and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Fox Newsgo back quite a ways. As he began -- Trump, as he began to craft his sort of conservative persona over the last several years, Fox was a key platform for that. He would call in frequently and talk to them. And even throughout the campaign and the beginning of his presidency, O'Reilly was one of his sort of key stops when he tried to sell his message.</p><p>And then, on top of that, you get into sort of the theory of conservatism and populism and how Fox Newsand O'Reilly, in particular, really sort of pioneered that style. Certainly, you know, the Trump effect owes quite a bit to that groundwork. And, you know, it was a little bit odd when that statement came out with Trump defending <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>so strongly given the accusations against him. Given some of the history of the campaign trail and the infamous tape that came out about <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>it dredged up a lot of that. But, you know, Trump -- he felt very loyal to <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>and really showed that sort of sense of fealty in that statement.</p><p>BRIGGS: Well, those two have been friends for decades. It was a good question, though. Would we have <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>if we didn't have <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly? </nameText></person>A lot to get to. Tal Kopan, thanks so much --</p><p>KOSIK: Thanks, Tal.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- for being with us this morning from Washington.</p><p>KOPAN: Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: More details now on that move rocking the world of cable news. As we've been telling you, <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly, </nameText></person>the top-rated host of Fox News' flagship show, \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" is out. The network canceling O'Reilly's show amid growing public pressure and an advertiser boycott as years of sexual harassment claims piled up. The announcement came from 21st Century Fox chief Rupert Murdoch and his sons.</p><p>BRIGGS: In a note to the company they paid tribute to O'Reilly's ratings and accomplishments, but also underlined the company's commitment to fostering a work environment \"built on the values of trust and respect.\" BRIGGS: Fox's decision to force O'Reilly out marks a stunning about- face for a company that stood by the superstar host through years of sometimes tawdry allegations. But after Fox Newschairman Roger Ailes resigned last summer under a cloud of similar claims, momentum seemed to shift against the seemingly untouchable host.</p><p>O'Reilly wished the network well on his way out as he defended his honor in a statement. \"Over the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history. It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims, but that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\"</p><p>It's unclear whether O'Reilly is getting a big payout. He may be owed tens of millions of dollars but it's also possible his new contract contains clauses allowing Fox to get out of a deal. Stay with us. We'll have much more on this story in the next half hour in \"NEW DAY\".</p><p>All right, some breaking news now. General Motors pulling out of Venezuela after its plant there was unexpectedly seized by authorities, a move the automaker calls illegal. GM says it plans to fight back legally and, meantime, will make severance payments to its thousands of Venezuelan employees. GM's decision won't help the worsening economic crisis there, though.</p><p>The country racked by huge anti-government protests demanding elections, denouncing critical food shortages, and what demonstrators call an increasingly authoritarian government. One Venezuelan National Guard sergeant shot and killed in the protest yesterday. Two civilians were killed and hundreds of people arrested.</p><p>KOSIK: Those pictures are just incredible.</p><p>BRIGGS: Utter chaos there in Venezuela.</p><p>KOSIK: Amazing. All right, big cuts at the EPA. Why, and what's the broader impact? That's next.</p><p>[05:47:50] KOSIK: Welcome back. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to reduce its workforce. That's according to an internal memo obtain by CNN and it shows the EPA will offer buyouts and an early retirement program to some workers. The agency will also maintain a hiring freeze with very limited exceptions, even as the government- wide ban expires.</p><p>Three hundred and fifty jobs went unfilled at the EPA under the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>hiring freeze and no new positions could be created. The union that represents EPA employees says the administration wants to cut between 3,000 and 4,000 full-time positions. That would be more than 25 percent of its workforce. The EPA has not responded to a CNN request for comment.</p><p>All right, time for a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY.\" Chris Cuomo joins us. Good morning to you, my friend.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR, \"NEW DAY\": Good morning. How are you, Alison Kosik?</p><p>KOSIK: Good.</p><p>CUOMO: We have much more on <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly's</nameText></person> exit from Fox News. We're going to talk to people who shared a set with him. What effect does this make on Fox Newsas a political culture there? What about as a professional culture there, and is that going to change even if <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>is gone?</p><p>Now, there's another political implication to O'Reilly being gone. What does this mean for <person><nameText>President Trump? </nameText></person>I'm not talking about his support of <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>but you have to remember how formative, how important <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>was in the development, introduction, and motivation of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>as a presidential candidate.</p><p>Also, on the other side of the aisle, the book that's making waves. It's called \"Shattered\" and it details what went wrong in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. We have the authors on and we're going to get their reaction to the fierce criticism now coming from the Clinton camp. That will all be on \"NEW DAY.\"</p><p>KOSIK: OK, that's good. I will be watching.</p><p>CUOMO: Thank you.</p><p>KOSIK: Good to see you. All right, some more bad headlines for Wells Fargo this morning. Federal regulators had at least 700 chances to stop the fake account scandal, but failed. We're going to explain when we get a check on CNN Money Stream, next.</p><p>[05:54:05] KOSIK: Congressman Jason Chaffetz, the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announcing he will not seek reelection in 2018. The Utah Republican insisting he has no ulterior motives and simply wants to return to the private sector back home in Utah. Chaffetz is best known for heading up the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as <person><nameText>Secretary of State. </nameText></person>He has, in the past, expressed an interest in becoming governor of Utah.</p><p>The Syrian government now seeking shelter for its combat planes following the U.S. missile strike earlier this month. That strike in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack the U.S. says Syria launched on its own people. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Dave, Alison, the U.S. missile strike in Syria now reverberating across the Syrian military. That missile strike took out about 20 percent of Syria's operational fighter jets and now the Syrians have apparently moved most of the rest of their inventory to a base along the coast quite close to the Russians, looking for that Russian umbrella of protection with Russian anti-air systems, Russian missiles. They may keep the Syrian aircraft but they can still launch additional attacks using their helicopters, artillery, and rockets.</p><p>[05:55:25] So, while the Syrians may think that they have solved their problem there is no indication yet that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is calling it a day on any future attacks against the Syrians if they use chemical weapons again -- Alison, Dave.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOSIK: OK, Barbara Starr, thanks very much. The U.S.-led coalition reporting a dramatic increase in ISIS' use of chemical weapons in Iraq. According to U.S. Defense officials there have been at least four incidents in the last week of ISIS fighters using chemical weapons, including mustard gas in Mosul. No deaths or coalition casualties have resulted from the attacks.</p><p>New military conduct regulations ban Navy and Marine personnel from distributing nude photos without the permission of the person depicted. The new rule effectively making any violation a crime that could be punished by a military court. It comes on the heels of a nude photo -- a nude photo-sharing scandal that's rocked all four branches of the military with photos of naked female service members being posted on Marines United and other private Facebook sites.</p><p>An attorney hired by the family of Aaron Hernandez says he will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the disgraced former NFL star. Corrections officials say Hernandez was found hanged in his prison cell Wednesday morning, an apparent suicide. His death coming just days after he was acquitted in a double murder case. Hernandez was already serving a life sentence without parole for the killing of Odin Lloyd. The Massachusetts chief medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.</p><p>All right, let's get a check on CNN Money Stream right now. Stock futures pointing higher this morning. Shares in Europe are mixed and stock markets in Asia closed mostly higher overnight. And this corporate earnings season -- first quarter earnings season kind of off to a rocky start.</p><p>Shares of IBM falling off a cliff, sinking almost five percent, and that was after the company reported that it beat profit estimates. But revenue missing badly here and investors dumping the stock as a result. IBM is one of the first big tech companies to report so investors are really going to be closely watching the sector over the next few weeks.</p><p>Big Blue weighed on the Dow, though, dragging the average to its second straight triple-digit loss. Look at the Nasdaq, though. It's up for the week. The S&amp;P 500, flat.</p><p>A troubling government report on Wells Fargo showing regulators failed to act on hundreds, if not thousands, of red flags. That, according to an internal review published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. One alarming red flag that went unheeded, in January 2010 the regulator was aware of 700 cases of whistleblower complaints about Wells Fargo's failed tactics. The report says regulators failed to confront executives or the company's board of directors, and it says the board knew about aggressive sales practices as early as 2004. Wells Fargo declined to comment.</p><p>All right, thanks for joining us.

Any chances that the President would meet with him there?  Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST:  At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders.  This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II.  That will be the focal point of the President's activities.  When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on.  I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p>Q:  <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there.  Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on.  And that's about it.</p><p>Q:  Is he actively going to avoid Putin?  I mean, would he even see him?  And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Again, this is still a month away here.  I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much.  And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin.  </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves.  And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy.  It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q:  Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events.  But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p>Q:  Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria.  Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role.  So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation.  But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide.  There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts.  We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community.  The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria.  But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q:  There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation.  We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q:  Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall.  The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there.  So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that?  And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I don't think so.  I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country.  There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians.  We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.  Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram. So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram.  And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups. Q:  In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama.  </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this?  And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning.  If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q:  A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital.  Josh (sic) said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary.  Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki.  I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran.</p><p>Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans.  And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things.  The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there.  I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously.  But there's a lot more work to be done.  We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened.  But we have turned that tide.  It's moving in the right direction.  And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q:  Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi.  Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q:  Quick question on sequestration.  There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies.  Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off.  Any White House input on that?  I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester.  And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester.  And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p>Q:  I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting.  So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, I think that's according to one report.  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service.  The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q:  I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night.  He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House.  Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year?  I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that.  Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Absolutely.  He believes that --</p><p>Q:  What gives him that belief?   Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Let me answer that question two ways.  The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats.  The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections.  We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot.  And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q:  Just one more question about them.  He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth.  Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process.  I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington.  And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country.  The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country.  And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do.  I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q:  He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that.  How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections.  And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified.  And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take.  I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else.  The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out.  This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012.  That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q:  In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did.  And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust.  The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience.  They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action.  And that's not always easy.  And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world.  And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q:  But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental.  I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop (by drop),' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\" So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do.  Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make.  I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world.  And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down.  This is an autonomous government.  But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down.  And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up.  It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q:  Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there.  This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies.  I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming.  They've been active on the immigration front.  With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q:  Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion.  We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country.  So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q:  Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy?  It seems like it's a bit of a mix.  I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST:  Yes, he can.  And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved.  There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can.  But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now.  The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody.  There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy.  Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies.  So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress.  And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p>Q:  Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it.  How does the White House feel?  Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill?  Is it enough that has been done?  Should she have talked more?

It's the latest move in his campaign against big tech, which he's accused of anti-conservative bias. And compared to other global leaders, he's taking a distinctly adversarial, outsider approach. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AARTI SHAHANI:                 The world over, people are worried that America's social media giants have too much power. Free speech die-hard Jillian York shares that concern. She goes online to check out a survey the White House put up this week.             </p><p>JILLIAN YORK:                 So this tool says that social media platforms should advance freedom of speech. I definitely agree with that.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 York is with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for Internet civil liberties. Years ago, she created a similar survey. Trump's asks about immigration status. You must say you're a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident to proceed. It asks which companies have taken action against the respondent.             </p><p>JILLIAN YORK:                 Oh, so this is interesting. It's focused only on four platforms.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube; hers did, too. Also like hers, Trump's asks for screenshots of what notification or pop-up the tech platform sent when they took censorship action. Though one glaring difference between hers and the president's - his final question to verify you are not a robot.             </p><p>JILLIAN YORK:                 The Declaration of Independence was signed in what year?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That is quite the verification question. Does she know her American history?             </p><p>JILLIAN YORK:                 Well, you know, I think I do. It's - I put in 1776.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 York and others say it's hard to know if the White House site is for real or farcical. It has some basic coding errors. It could be designed for data collection or a ploy to collect voter contacts, they say. Either way, the Trump move to protest and shame the social media giant stands in stark contrast to the approach by another head of state, French President Emmanuel Macron.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)                </p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON:                 (Through interpreter) A person who had access online to content of a racist nature.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Macron, with an English voice-over, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)                </p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON:                 (Through interpreter) We have to progress in that area to achieve smart regulation.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Trump launched his site three weeks after he sat down one-on-one with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a couple weeks after Facebook banned far-right leaders like Alex Jones, and the same day other heads of state gathered in Paris to commemorate the massacre of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, which was livestreamed on Facebook.             </p><p>                Macron has been working an insider-outsider strategy. France is developing new laws to combat cyber hate. This week he helped spearhead a gathering where governments and big tech signed a pledge to work together. He also brokered an exclusive deal with Facebook to give French regulators unprecedented insider access to the company to see how censorship decisions are made.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)                </p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON:                 (Through interpreter) We must ensure that the platforms withdraw the content and enable us to identify who is disseminating the hate speech and the negative ideas.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Kate Klonick, a law professor at St. John's University, says Macron and Trump have a lot in common - they both see big tech as a powerful force, they are both threatened by that power, but only one truly gets this fact.             </p><p>KATE KLONICK:                 You can't think of these platforms as representing any one particular nation. They're transnational platforms; they represent a global audience.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 White House spokesman Judd Deere says the administration created the online forum because they want to hear from all Americans, regardless of their political leanings.             </p><p>                Aarti Shahani, NPR News.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201905172111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4N-BH51-DY1J-T18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 17, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They were avoidable mistakes but they were unintentional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>NEIL CAVUTO, FBN HOST</nameText></person>: (Inaudible), Tim but fear not, you are in, Tim. <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>survives the hearing about his taxes but not enough about how he plans to spend our taxes. Tonight the man who had the job Tim wants on the screw ups should make sure he does not repeat if he wants to keep that job. Then Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. seeing red over those who question all the green going green. And they say life is a parade but does that mean we have to do what the president does and stick out through the whole darn thing? We are ready to march, now.</p><p>CAVUTO: <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>gets a grilling on the taxes he didn't pay but not nearly so much on his role in failed financial rescue in which he - well all of us continue to pay. Welcome, I am <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And here's the deal. <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>will be Treasury Secretary of the United States not because charges of sloppy bookkeeping aren't serious but because this financial crisis is even more serious. Yet at his Senate confirmation hearing today Mr. Geithner got more of a pummeling on his books than how he has helped handle the nation's books. He wasn't in charge of those books, mind you, but the very least he was a co-author, a co-signee if you will.</p><p>Our financial loans didn't loan and didn't rescue at bailouts that they themselves had to be bailed out. I'd like to hear more on how we botch those numbers than buttoning(ph) his own numbers. Some senators would carp about TARP but you asked Mr. Geithner how he would avoid another lark with TARP. And all because fear grips us and gosh Tim knows this stuff. He is smart. He is seasoned and he is ready just like Robert McMamara who led us into Vietnam and couldn't get us out. And Donald Rumsfeld who led us into Iraq without a plant o get us out.</p><p>So I'm trying to figure out this obsession with brainiacs. Take nothing away from how smart they are but how dumb maybe we are, too intimidated to think, maybe they aren't so smart especially when we can all clearly see the fall out of the financial rescue and assess for what it's been - dumb so far.</p><p>My next guest was asking these very question on TARP before it became a trap. In fact, George Bush's first Treasury Secretary had very serious questions and reservations about the rescue concocted by George Bush's last Treasury Secretary. Paul O'Neill joins me now. Well, good to have you.</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, FMR. TREASURY SECRETARY: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: First on Geithner, should he get it?</p><p>O'NEILL: He's going to get in.</p><p>CAVUTO: Should he?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think on balance, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Normally these issues - forgetting to pay your taxes and all would doom any other nominee in any other time or at least drag it out but not now because of the crisis, I guess. Should they?</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, I think as I understand the circumstances is there is to pay at some of thousands of dollars of taxes. I think as he said it is unfortunate and he wishes he had avoided but on balance I think he had to go ahead and get the job.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. Now, your argument has always been it's the big picture and I will hit the tax saying one more time with you. Part of the big picture is knowing what you run. And part of what you run is the IRS and the folks who make the tax rules.</p><p>You don't know all the rules, you know, I don't think even they do. But it still maybe they don't but still if they send a message that he does not.</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I don't know. Here is a question for you. There are 10,000 pages in the tax code, do you think there's any human being that understand the whole tax code? I don't. In the time I was secretary -</p><p>CAVUTO: The tax is -</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, Neil, I will give you an example. Do you know, that if you have an employee yourself, who cleans your house and it's against the law for you to give them a gift. Did you know, that? You probably thought you could give $10,000 a year to anyone without reporting it to the gift tax threshold. If not true, if you give your housekeeper a Christmas gift even if it's in goods, but particularly if it's in cash, say $10,000, you have to report it as wages paid and paid the withholding taxes on it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'NEILL: I'm giving you a specific thing. I'm telling you there are 10,000 pages.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not a big deal, move on, is what you are saying?</p><p>I would be ripped more for the handling of his role in the TARP funds that you are very critical about early on because what you saw what happened indeed has happened. So now we're going to release the other hundred 350 billion, the House is improving all these conditions, with strict provisos but they're going to screw up again.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, when I was here with you before I told you that I thought that it was a very big mistake for the federal government to assume preferred equity positions in financial institutions. Because I greatly fear the conversation that we heard yesterday about the Royal Bank of Scotland being nationalized by the U.K. government and with the -</p><p>CAVUTO: That is a preview of coming attractions -</p><p>O'NEILL: With the flow through into the conversation here in the U.S that the federal government would have to nationalize the bank which is the worst possible idea.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me ask you, a couple of months - when did I have you last time? I'm just trying to remember this because we were racing at the time with all rescues going on and at that time when they nixed the Lehman Brothers rescue. Here's what you had to say about that. Let's get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: What if something happens with Lehman? What if something happens with Lehman? You think -</p><p>O'NEILL: I'd let them go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes. Because I think the rest of the system is sufficiently well insulated if Lehman goes down it is a consequence for the shareholders, employer and leadership but that is OK with me.</p><p>CAVUTO: You draw the line here.</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, I think you draw the line here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now all the Monday morning quarterback are all saying you should not have done that, not you, but Lehman should have been rescued.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, I haven't changed my mind. If you listen carefully with what I said we should let the shareholders go to zero.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>O'NEILL: I didn't intend by that that we should throw the whole financial system into chaos and I think -</p><p>CAVUTO: That's what happens this Monday morning, they were saying because that is what we did. We let them go not appreciating the fact that it would let the financial system go.</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes. I think we need to be concerned. We need to worry. We need to intervene in a way that the financial system doesn't collapse because of absolute uncertainty about the counter party relationships and all of that. But it seems perfectly appropriate to me for people who are running private enterprises to if they do things that are substantially bad for them to be wiped out.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going quite the opposite way now, right. I mean, when I was in Washington, besides it's freezing. As long as you folks said the next step is to do something big to shore up support for the banking system and I ask someone but why not just nationalize them since that is what we're doing any way? Taxpayers are putting in it and one of - you know, you may not be that far off.</p><p>O'NEILL: I tell you what, I would do something a lot bigger than that. I would try and find a CEO to come on your show for half an hour and dissect their balance sheet for the American public to show that they really know what is in it and they can attest to its underlying values. So that if I was running a big bank and I have $200 billion worth of commercial loans that have been outstanding five years and I could say that these are all performing. I could say here is 200 billion, those are all performing. Here's another 100 billion and there are some late payments in this segment and so we have to mark those down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Your argument is that their books don't look nearly as bad as we've been led to believe. We got this Draconian end of the world description on the way we look at those books is unrealistic.</p><p>O'NEILL: My argument is this, if we don't tell the truth and make it clear that we know for certain what are a good assets it leaves the question, are any of the assets good? And that is why yesterday we had a 25, 30 percent sell-off in most of the financial institutions -</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going to keep seeing that. They bounced back today but this is just a roller-coaster.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know what, I think, I'm sorry (inaudible). I love having you on but I do want to get to this. Would you rescue or shore up Citigroup, Bank of America because they got almost $100 million of taxpayer money and they're still hurting puppies? Would you give them more?</p><p>O'NEILL: First of all, I would convert - any money that's been put into these institutions on a preferred stock basis I would replace it with federal 20-year loans with 200 basis points interest over the federal borrowing rate and then say to the regulators counted this as permanent capital. And then I would get if they asked the auto companies to do, I would get city, and JP Morgan and Bank of America to come in individually and dissect their portfolio and to the degree that they have, maybe 20 percent of their portfolio that they can't really value, that ought to be an open -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: What about central repository? I call it a suppository for sick banks and their toxic assets.</p><p>O'NEILL: Why do we want to do that? We ought to solve them on their own bottom.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm telling you the Obama folks are seriously considering.</p><p>O'NEILL: I understand they are.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you think it's a stupid idea.</p><p>O'NEILL: I didn't say stupid but I think but I think -</p><p>CAVUTO: Is there a better way?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think there's a better way, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Silly, clownish and bureaucratically the most inept thing you've ever heard in your life?</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't think it's the best idea. I think solving the individual financial institutions on their own bottom by having absolute clarity about what we know for sure. I give you an example. Right now, they all report the late pays and the (inaudible) on credit card every month. They ought to be able to do the same thing about all the loans that are on their books and if they can't do that, maybe you'll tell me they can't do it and I'll say we are really in trouble.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're really in trouble. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying they can't.</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't think we need to be in that trouble. I think we need somebody who will stand up and tell the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As you are standing telling the truth, speaking your mind. What would happen to you?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I tell you what. Sometimes, it's OK to get fired if you're telling the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well I will dodge that at all cost. Well, thank you very much, very good seeing you. The former, fine treasury secretary of this United States, Paul O'Neill.</p><p>When we come back Hillary Clinton is going to state and who is going to fill her seat. Does Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. know. What would you like to know? We'll find out next.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As expected a bit of a battle, a back and forth, a bit of a drama that Hillary Clinton is going to be the next Secretary of State. The Senate overwhelmingly approving that choice. Reaction from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on her appointment because remember his cousin Caroline could fill Hillary Clinton's Senate shoes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: I think Obama has himself as a good secretary of state. You saw her at the confirmation. She was prepared. She's smart. She is quick. She is thoughtful. And she as we know and you know that she's diplomatic personally. So I think - I don't think he could have gotten a better choice.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think this will get about eventually closing it (inaudible) she had one view on this subject, Robert, against you know, against Gitmo but not against closing it. I think that was the end campaign position and now the president, her boss is -</p><p>KENNEDY: She's going to do what her boss wants to do. And I think in the long run, I saw the piece you had on before this about some of the technical problems that's going to cause. You know, Neil, I travel all over the world and it has given this country such a black eye that -- that it really is a public relations catastrophe for us and the quicker we close it, the better.</p><p>CAVUTO: Al these countries criticize us. It's weird. And they don't want the prisoners either.</p><p>KENNEDY: It's not only the countries, it's the people. It's just what it has come to symbolize that this is the way Americans torture people. And that's what it will always symbolize because we crossed the line that we'd never crossed in our history before, you know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Someone crossed the line with us, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: After World War II, we executed Japanese officers for water boarding Americans. So this is a place we never torture people. George Washington during the revolution refused to torture British soldiers even though they were torturing us. Our soldiers are right here New York Harbor.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln actually when he was confronted with the idea of torturing people, he was so horrified that he created a commission that developed humane standards for fair treatment of prisoners.</p><p>CAVUTO: So bottomline -</p><p>KENNEDY: -- Later the Geneva convention.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understood. But you don't think this is a divisive issue between secretary of state?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think, absolutely that everybody I think will understand. Anybody who has to deal with foreign government's and foreign populations can understand that this has got to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understood. Well (inaudible). Your cousin, Caroline, the front runner for that supposed Senate seat that's opening up. What do you think of that?</p><p>KENNEDY: I hope she gets it. There's an electorate of one. So it's all up to David Paterson.</p><p>CAVUTO: What about the criticism that she got?</p><p>KENNEDY: We're in New York, Neil. Everybody gets criticized in New York.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why not you?</p><p>KENNEDY: I couldn't do it. As we discussed before I have six kids and that is a lot of mouths to feed. They all want to eat and they all want to go to school.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are a Kennedy you have money coming out of the yin yang. No?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I've always have to make my own money.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Let's talk a little bit about the environmental stuff. It's the reason why I got you in the beginning. You are very gracious to take these other questions. The environmental push, the administration is making it clear that while it is trying to free salaries for those members in the administration 100 grand or more, it is still very much on track to spend a lot of green going green. Should it?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. You know, if we need an industry that's going to bring us out of this depression. The quickest way that we can restore the economy in this country is to get off of foreign oil but two months ago we were spending $700 billion a year. We are borrowing $1 billion a day from countries that don't like us.</p><p>CAVUTO: How do you know that going green will make the world right?</p><p>KENNEDY: That will make the world what?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. With all of this strategy or technology?</p><p>KENNEDY: If we get off of foreign oil people, everybody say OK we gave 700 billion to Citibank. It's going to take generations to pay it back. It's not going to take generations. It's going to take one year without foreign oil. We pay the whole thing back. It's going to generate huge dividends for our economy.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what if we made a hunch on an investment that what essentially the government is doing and it turns out to be a bad bet?</p><p>KENNEDY: It's not a investment bet. It is creating an infrastructure that will allow the free market economy to function in the lowest cost producers of energy to get into the marketplace. They can't do that now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: But the free-market looks at it and says it is not our cup of tea. What are we going to do?</p><p>KENNEDY: The marketplace is already out there. People are clamoring to hook up. Look at T. Boone Pickens. You know, I'm involved with green tech firms like Vantage Point. They are clamoring to build wind and solar. The problem is we don't have a grid that can carry that energy, that can transfer the electrons. What we need to do is create a national grid that is smart grid that can deploy, store and deploy energy, it will cost $150 billion to do that.</p><p>Once you do that, we have free energy in this country forever. We never have to go over to Saudi Arabia. We don't have to get 4.5 trillion dollar wars. We don't have to spend $100 billion per year protecting pipelines.</p><p>CAVUTO: you think that this commitment to go green is going to wipe our dependence on oil?</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh yes, of course, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO: How soon?</p><p>KENNEDY: As soon as we wanted to. Israel is doing it in three years. If Israel can do it. We can do it too. All we have to do. Listen, in 1979, we had no - we built and we bought days to build the Arpanet(ph), an internet grid essentially.</p><p>The year later, 1980, there were fewer than 500 PCs in this country and IBM said it was a dead-end technology. But because we built the marketplace, the grid where everybody could hook up. Everybody in this country has PCs today and the world has been transformed. All we need to do is build a national grid that can reach the big wind there, the midwest of this country is the Saudi Arabia of when we have the most wind just in North Dakota, Montana and Texas to provide all the energy needed -</p><p>CAVUTO: Just in D.C.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well a lot of hot air.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Right. How was your Uncle's doing?</p><p>KENNEDY: He is good. He got out of the hospital this morning and he's on his way to Florida.</p><p>CAVUTO: What happened?</p><p>KENNEDY: He had a seizure. The doctors say its connected with fatigue and obviously, you know, it's connected with the tumor in his brain. It's the same kind of seizure that he had initially that alerted us that he did have this problem. But he`s fully recovered last night. He was joking. He was you know talking and completely lucid all night and today he left for Florida.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well does Bob Olsen(ph) think that Tim is getting a pass? And not on his taxes but what he plans to do with our taxes? After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. The market is still trying to make sense of what President Barack Obama has in store for them. My next guest, watch him Geithner's confirmation hearing and say enough with this all tax nonsense, did he pay taxes, did he not? Get him to work right now. Investor and chairman of the highly regard Olstein Funds, Bob Olstein is with us. Bob, you said just put Tim in there, right?</p><p>BOB OLSTEIN, THE OLSTEIN FUNDS, CHAIRMAN: You got to put him in there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why?</p><p>OLSTEIN: First of all, I trust Paul Volcker and Paul Volcker said he is good, number one. And number two, he's got familiarity with this situation. I know, you think he did wrong things but they did not do the wrong things.</p><p>CAVUTO: Just because you have familiarity with a fire doesn't mean you don't take responsibility for having caused it.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me tell you something, this fire has been caused by people in Washington, Wall Street. Everybody -</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. I agree with all that, Bob. But why do all of the Wall Street brainiacs, I put you on the top of heap, march like lemmings to this Geithner. He is so smart. He is the best. We can't wait. There's not another human being on the planet to do his job.</p><p>OLSTEIN: That is not true.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I have not heard one person say, you know what, there are other human beings down there.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they seem to know a little.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well now you heard it from me but right now, we got to get on this situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why don't you run. Why don't you become Treasury Secretary.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'd nominate you.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's just across the street from the White House. I will send a letter to the president. First of all, I will pick up the phone.</p><p>OLSTEIN: We got to attack two things, regulation of Wall Street and marginary -</p><p>CAVUTO: I would get to that and your little nerdy ideas of how to fix this. But why do you think <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>is the guy to do it?</p><p>OLSTEIN: Because he's on the scene right now. I think that we've got to get on the scene. To start going through a fight right now and trying to get new people on -</p><p>CAVUTO: Get it to the rescuer. If the rescue isn't working, find another rescuer.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well, this rescuer, he will work. He is as good as anybody else. He's on the top.</p><p>CAVUTO: You just said as good as anyone else.</p><p>OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is some pretty demeaning phrase, right? Well that is the best we can do right now.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Wait a second, if you have all stars and you say that this 11 all-stars out there I will pick one of 11 - this is guy is an all-star --.</p><p>CAVUTO: I will go for the other 10.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Why are you against him? Because he made a tax mistake?</p><p>CAVUTO: No because he caused this whole problem to begin with. He had a front-row seat.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN: A front row seat at what. You are absolutely wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait, wait. You know, the rescue was horrific. Right?</p><p>OLSTEIN: No, it was not.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. All right now. Let's get back to this comedy you call a rescue that you think is working.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me say something, when a patient is dying, you got to breathe some air into the system. You saw what happened to Lehman. You just said this at your Treasury Secretary. If you let the Lehman let go and you saw what happened, it sent this into another tailspin.</p><p>CAVUTO: Have you seen what's happened here Bob? Let me tell you here. We've given Citigroup and Bank of America almost $100 billion tax dollars.</p><p>OLSTEIN: What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN: What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just saying, they first (inaudible) when they got it.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Answer my question, what if Citigroup failed? Do you think Lehman (inaudible)? What if Merrill Lynch failed?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if you have a job to know of all those players going with Bob Olstein, you say money, money, money -</p><p>OLSTEIN: (inaudible) and you had to save the system first.</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the system. Take a look around here, Bob. Take a look at what's around.</p><p>OLSTEIN: It's in dire straits.</p><p>CAVUTO: These banks have lost all of that and more in market value and lost revenue then you have given them as taxpayers.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me tell you something, if you didn't give them the money, Citibank was gone. So, is Merrill Lynch.</p><p>CAVUTO: What would Bob Olstein do now? Assuming this guy gets in. He's going to get in.</p><p>OLSTEIN: What did the depression -</p><p>CAVUTO: What's he going to do?</p><p>OLSTEIN: What did the depression do to this country? What do you think happened?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm not - you're not answering my question.</p><p>OLSTEIN: He comes in. Now, he's going to attack the real problem. The real problem started in the housing industry and that's what we got to save right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: How would you do it? We got $350 billion -</p><p>OLSTEIN: You know what, you have to go in and rescue the mortgages and you have to take first equity in these mortgages. That is what you have to do. Because -</p><p>CAVUTO: So all people late on their mortgages, you're going to rescue them?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not going to rescue them, we're going to get the mortgages and write them down to true market value and have the government be the first out when these equity -</p><p>CAVUTO: Well how about those who are paying the mortgages on time, are you going to rescue them? So are you going to rescue them?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not writing down mortgages to save the people. I'm writing down mortgages to save the system.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of people get the benefit.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Everyone says let's get the big guys on Wall Street. Let's kill Lehman. So we killed Lehman and he took all the small guys with him.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you hear what you are saying?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I absolutely do.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are saying in order to help shore up their balance sheets, write down these mortgages to their acceptable value today, right?</p><p>OLSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, wait, you know, you're going to benefit those holders of those mortgages at the time. So some are going to be benefiting from Bob Olstein's financial fix and those meanwhile who are paying their mortgages whose mortgages are not in arrears and whose banks are not calling their number, they are going will get the bill for the other ones who got stupid.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Who said the government is not going to take the equity in the homes? Who said that the government is not going to take the equity?</p><p>CAVUTO: So if someone is going to bail me out and Uncle Sam is going to -</p><p>OLSTEIN: We're not bailing you out or me out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Fixing their books is bailing out, Bob.</p><p>OLSTEIN: But let me ask you a question, you want to buy that bad loans. So who are they bailing out then?</p><p>CAVUTO: So you say this is a rescue of another name?</p><p>OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. That I understand. OK. It's a rescue of another name.</p><p>OLSTEIN: The patient is you got to rescue them or we are going under. That's is. I`m telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do see it as a slippery slope here though?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I don't see it as a slippery slope. I think they're dealing with the situation as best they can. Of course, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>would go in there and would have saved the entire situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: I would have done nothing.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well, let me tell you something. You would not have a job now.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, this fear of god is what got everyone - (inaudible)</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me ask you a question, how much has been written off already. This is not the fear of God. How much money has been put in?</p><p>CAVUTO: How much has been given and we are still worse off than we were.</p><p>OLSTEIN: We are worse off than you were. You are better off than you would have been.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are feeding the beast.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I don't care. I know what the beast is. It's the problem and the problem was started 10 and 20 years ago with all these derivatives, and credit default swaps and getting around the system and Congressman's saying, everybody has to be in a home. Everybody should not be in a home. This is -</p><p>CAVUTO: You're going to (inaudible) that a lot of people who shouldn't be in a home are going to be rewarded for being in a home.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not rewarding them.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, you are. To infinity.</p><p>OLSTEIN: All right. What I want to do then is just kick them out and what happens to the economics.</p><p>CAVUTO: I would like to kick you out, you're bothering me. No, seriously, stick around because I want to bring in the next guest.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: He says President Obama should pull Tim, and says this whole Geithner obstruction is a waste of time and the president is wasting time and our time, pushing in. Peter Flaherty is the president of the national league on policy center. You may have heard some of our discussion. Bob and I do really love each other deeply. I have enormous respect for him but Peter, I want to get your sense of Geithner. You're saying he's not worth the trouble? Get rid of him?</p><p>PETER FLAHERTY, NATIONAL LEAGUE &amp; P0LIDY CENTER PRESIDENT: Leading the financial meltdown aside for a moment is nothing more fundamental here. Timothy Geithner is not qualified ethically to serve in any government position.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why? Because of the tax thing?</p><p>FLAHERTY: Let's take a look at some simple facts here. He was audited in 2006. It was found that he did not pay his payroll taxes for the years 2001 through 2004.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know the whole tax thing Peter -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLAHERTY: So what is fundamental -</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So that alone disqualifies him? Bob was saying the tax code is very complicated.</p><p>FLAHERTY: Yes, he paid two years, but then he relied on the statute of limitation not to pay for the other two years. And he only paid those other two years.</p><p>CAVUTO: That alone --</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>FLAHERTY: His assertion that this is unintentional does not pass the laugh test. At a certain point, he made a conscious decision not to pay taxes for the years 2001 and 2002.</p><p>CAVUTO: He correct them. He did pay them. Bob, that was good enough for you.</p><p>OLSSEN: He made a mistake.</p><p>FLAHERTY: It was not a mistake. It was not a mistake. It was a willful tax evasion.</p><p>CAVUTO: He tried to say this was a mistake. I did this, all that. Do you think, if you put that aside, and I know it's a big thing for you to put aside, do you think his handling of the financial rescue, being a key participant in it, should be among the issues that disqualify him?</p><p>FLAHERTY: I think it is a serious issue. He was at Hank Paulson's side when many of the decisions were made about these various bail outs. During the campaign, you may remember that John McCain suggested that SEC Chairman Chris Cox should be fired. And Obama said, I would fire the whole bunch. Well, one of the bunch was <person><nameText>Tim Geithner.</nameText></person></p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>OLSSEN: I understand your position but I don't think it is practical right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Because you say we just need to do this?</p><p>FLAHERTY: We need to get on it, now rather than later.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'll give you another reason to fire him, always looking at his blackberry. You ever notice, every video shot we have, he is running around, looking at the blackberry. I'm just saying, you should be focused on the financial crisis and not your blackberry.</p><p>OLSSEN: Maybe they are wiring him about the financial crisis.</p><p>FLAHERTY: What does it say about our new president? The true test of character is doing what is right when you don't have the votes, not like right now when you do have the votes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Peter, why don't you text message that to him. Let the secretary to be know that. Bob, you're never coming on the show because you are very nasty, but you are also very brilliant. So you are coming back. Barack Obama tipping his hand on how he is going to pay for a lot of this stimulus. Much of the general media did not notice. We did.</p><p>CAVUTO: President Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullin, General David Petraeus in this hour in the white situation room. The talk is about drawing down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. This on the same day he paved the way to shut down Gitmo. A signal that he is about to pare defense spending and maybe a lot.</p><p>Let's ask John Robinson, managing editor of \"Defense Daily.\" What do you think?</p><p>JOHN ROBINSON, \"DEFENSE DAILY\": I don't think so, Neil. I don't think for two reasons that he is going to cut defense spending. One, it is politically unacceptable for him to come after the Defense Budget during this time of war. Two, he has really promised to, at least at worst, keep the defense budget steady. As a result of those two things, politically, and just backing up his promises, it is just not going to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you think about, and you start paring the number of active troop levels by 100,000 or commit to that, that's obviously a lot less money you have to budget for that. If you shut down or get the process going to shut down Gitmo, much of the money is allocated to that begin to be pared. A trend here is what I'm saying. You don't?</p><p>ROBINSON: It's sort of a zero sum game to some extent. A lot of those forces move to Afghanistan. It could be other parts of the world. In his speech, he talked about helping other parts of the world. Does that mean we're going to be sending troops to Africa, other places where there is humanitarian assistance needed?</p><p>CAVUTO: You're not seeing it as a troop draw down as just a shuffling.</p><p>ROBINSON: Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: Typically, that's the reaction you get when a Democrat comes to office, defense stocks come down. These days, all stocks are going down. But -- and because it is bad, because Democrats -- that is an easy area to cut. Or that is the rap. You don't think that is going to be the case?</p><p>ROBINSON: Also, Neil, we're in a recession right now. If we are going to cut defense spending, we're going to be throwing defense workers out of jobs. And those are union jobs in many of these shops. It is just not politically going to be good. What I think is interesting is that defense spending really wasn't part of the stimulus package. They could have thrown a bunch of goodies in there to build more aircraft, build more ships. Really, they didn't do it.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is a very good point. John Robinson, \"Defense Daily\" managing editor. I want to steal you back. Very interesting insight on this.</p><p>Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard not at all surprised by the president's Gitmo move to eventually shut it down. But he did tell me he is watching the situation carefully.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD: I would expect the new administration to maintain a very strong stance against terrorism. That is what the overwhelming majority of the American people and America's friends around world want. It was the policy of President Obama during the campaign to close down Guantanamo Bay. I can't imagine, though, that in the process of doing that there won't be arrangements made to ensure that people charged with terrorist offenses, crimes against American or other citizens, that those people won't be brought to justice in some other way. I would find it unbelievable that other arrangements wouldn't be made.</p><p>I imagine, I could be wrong, but I imagine that what is in contemplation is another arrangement for people to be brought to justice, perhaps on the American mainland. Now, it was the policy of the new president to do this, having been elected. I now have, being elected on some explicit commitments, your first instincts are to act to implement those commitments, whether other people agree with them or not.</p><p>That is his policy. Having won the ballot, he is entitled to implement that policy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Speaking of the new president, it was a bit of a dust-up for you here in the United States, as well as Australia, when you came visiting. You were staying at Blair House. The president-elect had wanted to move in early to Blair House, because his two daughters were going to start school early. He ended up in hotel. You were in Blair House. What happened?</p><p>HOWARD: What happens, as I understand it -- let's face it, I was invited by the then president as a guest to stay at Blair House. It was a gracious invitation. I accepted it. The whole thing is an enormous beat- up by sections of the media. My understanding is, in accordance with normal custom, there are a whole slew of events being held up at Blair House up until a week before the inauguration. Then the new president moves in.</p><p>CAVUTO: Everyone tried to blame you. It was Howard's fault, Howard's fault.</p><p>HOWARD: All I can say is the former president was very gracious and acting in accordance with normality in inviting me to stay there. It is a very great honor to have done so. And I'm quite sure in the great scheme of things it wouldn't have been very high on the new president's mind.</p><p>CAVUTO: And it wasn't. President Obama, then President-Elect Obama, didn't make a big deal of it. He was very gracious, as were you. Do you think that President Bush, at the time when he said, no I'm not going to move the prime minister out of Blair House, when some were saying that he should have -- the fact that he didn't, what did you think of that?</p><p>HOWARD: I don't buy into that. Look, President Bush was gracious enough to invite me. I accepted the invitation. It would have been almost rude to have said no.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>HOWARD: And I obviously was not seeking in any way to offend the new president. I don't believe I did. And I'm just not going to buy into what was beaten up into something by a section of the American media. The facts get in the way of a good story.</p><p>CAVUTO: As if you control where you stay. I guess we could have put you up at a Best Western, but we chose Blair House.</p><p>Let me ask you, finally then, your sense of this global respect that Barack Obama wants in the community, something he says was lost with President Bush. How important is that for a leader to be liked by everybody?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, in the long run, any leader will have the impact that his policies and his performance deserve and deliver. I think history will judge President Bush a lot more kindly than many of the commentators at the present time. With a new president, particularly President Obama being the very African-American president in your country's history, that in itself is a wonderful thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>HOWARD: And people are entitled to feel that way. But he will start his term with great goodwill, as all new president do. Whether that is retained over a period of time will depend entirely upon how he handles himself. And we all want him to succeed, because the leadership of the United States is important to the rest of the world. But, in the long run, he will be judged on his performance, his policies and his record.</p><p>And that is how the political system works. But he does have big challenges. I think the world has to be very careful in responding to this economic crisis, that we don't commit future generations to too much additional debt.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>HOWARD: It's one thing to bail things out now. It's another thing to pay for those debts years into the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so if Steve Jobs is hurting, than Apple has really got to be hurting, right? News flash.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Shares of Apple rallying in after-hours trading. The company just blew past many of the most robust earnings estimates. So is all of this hammering about Steve Jobs's health overdone? Let's ask the Fox Business All-Stars, Jonathan Hoenig, Howard Rosencrans, John Tabacco, Tracy Byrnes.</p><p>John Tabacco, to you first. That is a great report, firing on all cylinders, iPods, iMacs, everything moving.</p><p>JOHN TOBACCO, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: You know me. I'm always with the evil short sellers. I've got to say right off the bat, it is not about Steve Jobs's health at this point. It's about right now a lot of people are saying iPhones stink, that the batteries stink. The screens are freezing up. There was a craze of buying. But looking out on the horizon, one of the best innovations in the new iPhone is this Google map feature which everyone loves. They can hit their Zagats restaurants and everywhere they need to go.</p><p>But 2010 comes the Google Phone. And there is no risk --</p><p>CAVUTO: You think this is short lived. Enjoy it now?</p><p>TABACCO: I think the short sellers are seemingly agreeing today that Apple is headed down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Stock was up today, right?</p><p>TABACCO: Today is a mere snapshot of what will happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Snapshot on your iPhone. What do you make that, Howard?</p><p>HOWARD ROSENCRANS, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: I'm not going to bet against Apple. The marketing is brilliant. I haven't heard any of these things John has heard that had all the negative commentary associated with the maps. It is an amazing company. All that said, you're talking about 10 billion dollars in an individual quarter in an economy that continues to deteriorate at the high end.</p><p>CAVUTO: That was an impressive. They sold very well in a tough environment.</p><p>TABACCO: Think about how much stimulus money we gave out last year to buy stuff like iPhones. Is that going to keep going?</p><p>CAVUTO: We could have bought other places.</p><p>TABACCO: There was great marketing, no doubt. But you haven't heard that the iPhones are freezing up and the batteries stink? You haven't heard that?</p><p>ROSENCRANS: At the margin.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>TABACCO: I hear a lot of guys switching back.</p><p>TRACY BYRNES, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: I think what they have done is genius, because they were selling the Mac. The Mac was their bread and butter for a while. That slowed. They got the Phone. Sales were up 88 percent, which is amazing. Now that the you got the iPhone, you are going to want to buy a Mac. People are going to want to integrate the whole thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: You see that continuing.</p><p>BYRNES: I totally seeing it continuing. But I don't see this Steve Jobs health thing going away.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Jonathan Hoenig, back to Steve Jobs and whether that is going to have a pall over the company? People are going to start thinking, you know, he is the guy who makes all this possible, what happens?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: Neil, the stock has been hurt and has been hurt very sharply even when people thought Steve Jobs's health was a lot better. Even with today's pop up after-hours, up about eight percent, stock is still near a 52-week low.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is around 90, right? It's highest was 185, something like that?</p><p>HOENIG: Right. And basically this is a market performer now. It is 13 percent of the Nasdaq 100. Until that next technology that Tracy alluded to --</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>HOENIG: It is the major tech stock. It really is a cult stock, Neil. Until they get that new technology out there that inspires people to line up outside the Apple stores all over America, I don't think it is going to be a place you make any money.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I was way wrong on that Apple quote. I'm sorry. The chart was accurate. I wasn't. John, at 82 or something, how low does this thing go then?</p><p>TABACCO: Maybe me and Howard should do a double or nothing on our Lehman bet. I would say you see 60 before 120.</p><p>ROSENCRANS: I'm in your camp, John. I'm embarrassed because of the macro picture associated with it. I don't see them --</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you guys find something weird going on here? Apple has a good report. IBM optimistic looking into the next fiscal year. These are some big tech heavyweights that are saying, you know, the water is just fine.</p><p>ROSENCRANS: Apple came out and they made commentary on the immediate quarter. They don't put it out any further than that. They're always providing cautious commentary. However, they did suggest a fairly powerful quarter.</p><p>IBM, on the other hand, when you're talking about 29 billion dollars in the quarter, that does make a hell of a statement. It suggests -- because IBM can not be just an IBM story. It has to be a decent commentary. Somehow they are seeing --</p><p>BYRNES: If you look at the numbers, Neil, a lot of it was in their servicing. What that means is people in IBM's case are keeping their computers, and having things serviced to make them last longer. Nobody wants to go out and buy things. They keep putting out products, Apple. I keep buying them for my kids. Stock will save up.</p><p>TABACCO: So people are servicing their IBMs, but they are going to run out and buy a Mac because they love their iPhone. That is contrary.</p><p>BYRNES: It is not. This was the --</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, we have to pay our bills here. We're not right now. So mixed messages from the markets to President Obama. But the president was pretty clear in what he wanted to tell Wall Street today. We'll explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Down about 300 points on inauguration day. Up about 300 points on his first full in office. Mixed messages from the street to its young president. But a clear message to Wall Street from the president. He is freezing salaries of any White House staff making over 100,000 dollars a year. That is about what Hoenig makes in an hour.</p><p>So 100,000, is that the new rich? Jonathan?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, for Obama, Neil, that line is kind of changed for quite a long time, right? It was 250. Then it went down to 200.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'll tell you something, Jonathan, when he first started campaigning a couple years ago, a millionaire was rich. You earn a million dollars -- throughout the campaign, it went down and down.</p><p>HOENIG: It keeps going lower. Listen, every company in America, Neil, is freezing salaries. So on some level, I'm glad to see him taking some responsibility for spending in Washington. What worries me more though is the control he is likely to exert over private sector about what they pay their CEOs and their executives, not to mention the hundreds of billions of dollars that he's going to be shuffling out the door to all his pet projects.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think Jonathan hit on a brilliant point. I think what is going on here -- you know, they always have the gap between the rich and the poor, Tracy, I think rather than bring the bottom up, let's whack the top down?</p><p>BYRNES: If you go through even the tax proposals, not one of them, not anything applies to anybody who makes over 200,000. And actually, it is at 150,000 where they start to phase out. He is not giving anything to the people at the top. And as you're saying, we even hear Pelosi saying she wants to raise taxes on the top. So yes, he is going to try to bring us all down into this happy minimum.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now I have a new Machiavellian theory on that. That was a trial balloon for the administration to stick it to the rich sooner. What do you think, John?</p><p>TABACCO: I say let the social engineering begin. This is the first in one of many moves that you'll see. A hundred thousand, that is all you can make. Now we can hire a lot more 20, 30, 40 thousand dollar employees.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that the message the government sends, that all of a sudden you're saying, 100,000 sounds like a lot to us. Do you think, Howard, it is telling private sector, if you're cutting, go to that crowd?</p><p>ROSENCRANS: Listen, it sending a nice, quote, message. At end of the day, though, it is pretty important to want to attract the best people to work in this profession. To make a commentary on what people are going to get paid in the private sector or to it in government, to send the message that, it is --</p><p>CAVUTO: I just found out the other day what other anchors here are being paid. Ticks me off royally. Jonathan Hoenig, I'm looking at that, and I'm just saying, this could be the opening salvo to social engineering. Or am I over-dramatizing it?</p><p>HOENIG: Neil, it absolutely is. Now, of course, the government is a major shareholder throughout the entire financial world, in Citibank, in Bank of America. Believe me, the Barney Franks, the Chris Dodds, and yes, President Obama are going to make a big deal about what those on the top, even some of those in the middle are making in terms of salary at the end of the day.</p><p>BYRNES: Those guys in D.C. never made a lot of money to begin with. They all make between 100 and 200 to begin with. He's not making a --</p><p>CAVUTO: How long are they going to be frozen?</p><p>TABACCO: Who knows? Probably for a while. Most government workers I know get paid, like you said, between 100 and 200. But they work like 20 hours a day, these guys, already.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of them do.</p><p>TABACCO: You can't make more than 100 grand. What kind of opportunity are you creating for these people to work as hard as you're working now or harder, because we're in tough times.</p><p>BYRNES: They're doing it for the good of the people.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think he is sending a message, we're pulling our belts in.</p><p>TABACCO: People that should be worried are the guys like Robert Kennedy. We need innovation to go green and we don't have the money to get innovation.</p><p>CAVUTO: When we come back, he let his mother-in-law move into the White House, got the Jonas Brothers to perform for his kids in the White House, and endured two straight hours of watching a parade outside the White House. Policy aside, if that isn't devotion, I don't know what is.</p><p>CAVUTO: Can I ask you something? Do you like parades? I got into a lot of trouble last night when I said I'm not a big fan of them myself. Nothing personal. But they just kind of go on and on and on. I got more than a few marching band coordinators sick. One of them e-mailed me to say \"had he been there, he would have heaved a baton at my skull.\" Said, \"I should be more like President and Mrs. Obama. Not only do they love a parade, they're among the first few couples, at least that I have ever seen, never to take their eyes off it. Never.\"</p><p>I saw it for myself. They were just about the last ones standing in that White House reviewing stand. I'm not kidding. Because I was across the street.</p><p>Anyway, look at this, when the parade started, all those coveted seats in the glass enclosed stand were taken, even the cheap seats out in the freezing cold. Then only minutes into the parade, they all start scattering like me at a health food store. You've got cabinet secretaries and social secretaries and pretty much all the secretaries, then even the dude who was serving drinks.</p><p>Soon even Sasha and Malia were out of there. The mother-in-law too. By the parade's wee end, barely a wee soul in that stand, save the cheering and waving and very happy Barack and Michelle Obama.</p><p>I didn't once see them take a break or once not acknowledge every marcher and twirler and flipper and singer and trumpeter, not a one. Sure, you could say it was in their honor; they had to stay. Actually, they didn't. They had inaugurals balls to go to, and since everything was running late, really, really late, this marching madness was cutting into what was supposed to be two hours of quiet quality time in their new home.</p><p>No matter. If the band played on, they stayed on. As my headache from all the noise just went on and on. I kept asking, surely they can't take two hours of this without a break? They just smiled and waved, as if to say, actually, yes, we can. Republicans be warned, if you think you can roll these guys, think again. They have endured more than you going on and on. They've endured the ultimate, parades that go on and on, even longer. And they even looked happy doing it.</p><p>It's not right. Good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2009012101cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W77-4K70-Y8Y1-715N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8206\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved. </copyright><publicationName>Cavuto</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>January 21, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CL</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES &amp; TREASURIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CL</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES &amp; TREASURIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000A4GI</classCode><className>TIMOTHY GEITHNER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>PE000A5DL</classCode><className>NEIL CAVUTO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>PE0009U6F</classCode><className>GEORGE W BUSH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC358</classCode><className>IRAQ</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

They were avoidable mistakes but they were unintentional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> NEIL CAVUTO, FBN HOST:  (Inaudible), Tim but fear not, you are in, Tim.   Tim Geithner survives the hearing about his taxes but not enough about how  he plans to spend our taxes.  Tonight the man who had the job Tim wants on  the screw ups should make sure he does not repeat if he wants to keep that  job.  Then Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. seeing red over those who question all  the green going green.  And they say life is a parade but does that mean we  have to do what the president does and stick out through the whole darn  thing?  We are ready to march, now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Tim Geithner gets a grilling on the taxes he didn't pay but not  nearly so much on his role in failed financial rescue in which he - well  all of us continue to pay.  Welcome, I am Neil Cavuto.  And here's the  deal.  Tim Geithner will be Treasury Secretary of the United States not  because charges of sloppy bookkeeping aren't serious but because this  financial crisis is even more serious.  Yet at his Senate confirmation  hearing today Mr. Geithner got more of a pummeling on his books than how he  has helped handle the nation's books.  He wasn't in charge of those books,  mind you, but the very least he was a co-author, a co-signee if you will.</p><p> Our financial loans didn't loan and didn't rescue at bailouts that they  themselves had to be bailed out.  I'd like to hear more on how we botch  those numbers than buttoning(ph) his own numbers.  Some senators would carp  about TARP but you asked Mr. Geithner how he would avoid another lark with  TARP.  And all because fear grips us and gosh Tim knows this stuff.  He is  smart.  He is seasoned and he is ready just like Robert McMamara who led us  into Vietnam and couldn't get us out.  And Donald Rumsfeld who led us into  Iraq without a plant o get us out.</p><p> So I'm trying to figure out this obsession with brainiacs.  Take nothing  away from how smart they are but how dumb maybe we are, too intimidated to  think, maybe they aren't so smart especially when we can all clearly see  the fall out of the financial rescue and assess for what it's been - dumb  so far.</p><p> My next guest was asking these very question on TARP before it became a  trap.  In fact, George Bush's first Treasury Secretary had very serious  questions and reservations about the rescue concocted by George Bush's last  Treasury Secretary.  Paul O'Neill joins me now.  Well, good to have you.</p><p> PAUL O'NEILL, FMR. TREASURY SECRETARY:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  First on Geithner, should he get it?</p><p> O'NEILL:  He's going to get in.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Should he?</p><p> O'NEILL:  I think on balance, yes.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Normally these issues - forgetting to pay your taxes and all would  doom any other nominee in any other time or at least drag it out but not  now because of the crisis, I guess.  Should they?</p><p> O'NEILL:  You know, I think as I understand the circumstances is there is  to pay at some of thousands of dollars of taxes.  I think as he said it is  unfortunate and he wishes he had avoided but on balance I think he had to  go ahead and get the job.</p><p> CAVUTO:  OK.  Now, your argument has always been it's the big picture and I  will hit the tax saying one more time with you.  Part of the big picture is  knowing what you run.  And part of what you run is the IRS and the folks  who make the tax rules.</p><p> You don't know all the rules, you know, I don't think even they do.  But it  still maybe they don't but still if they send a message that he does not.  </p><p> O'NEILL:  Well, I don't know.  Here is a question for you.  There are  10,000 pages in the tax code, do you think there's any human being that  understand the whole tax code?  I don't. In the time I was secretary -</p><p> CAVUTO:  The tax is - </p><p> O'NEILL:  Well, Neil, I will give you an example.  Do you know, that if you  have an employee yourself, who cleans your house and it's against the law  for you to give them a gift.  Did you know, that?  You probably thought you  could give $10,000 a year to anyone without reporting it to the gift tax  threshold.  If not true, if  you give your housekeeper a Christmas gift  even if it's in goods, but particularly if it's in cash, say $10,000, you  have to report it as wages paid and paid the withholding taxes on it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'NEILL:  I'm giving you a specific thing.  I'm telling you there are  10,000 pages.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Not a big deal, move on, is what you are saying?</p><p> I would be ripped more for the handling of his role in the TARP funds that  you are very critical about early on because what you saw what happened  indeed has happened.  So now we're going to release the other hundred 350  billion, the House is improving all these conditions, with strict provisos  but they're going to screw up again.</p><p> O'NEILL:  You know, when I was here with you before I told you that I  thought that it was a very big mistake for the federal government to assume  preferred equity positions in financial institutions.  Because I greatly  fear the conversation that we heard yesterday about the Royal Bank of  Scotland being nationalized by the U.K. government and with the -</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is a preview of coming attractions -</p><p> O'NEILL:  With the flow through into the conversation here in the U.S that  the federal government would have to nationalize the bank which is the  worst possible idea.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, let me ask you, a couple of months - when did I have you  last time? I'm just trying to remember this because we were racing at the  time with all rescues going on and at that time when they nixed the Lehman  Brothers rescue.  Here's what you had to say about that.  Let's get your  reaction.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What if something happens with Lehman?  What if something happens  with Lehman?  You think -</p><p> O'NEILL:  I'd let them go.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Really?</p><p> O'NEILL:  Yes.  Because I think the rest of the system is sufficiently well  insulated if Lehman goes down it is a consequence for the shareholders,  employer and leadership but that is OK with me.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You draw the line here.</p><p> O'NEILL:  Yes, I think you draw the line here.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Now all the Monday morning quarterback are all saying you should  not have done that, not you, but Lehman should have been rescued.</p><p> O'NEILL:  You know, I haven't changed my mind.  If you listen carefully  with what I said we should let the shareholders go to zero.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p> O'NEILL:  I didn't intend by that that we should throw the whole financial  system into chaos and I think -</p><p> CAVUTO:  That's what happens this Monday morning, they were saying because  that is what we did.  We let them go not appreciating the fact that it  would let the financial system go.</p><p> O'NEILL:  Yes.  I think we need to be concerned.  We need to worry.  We  need to intervene in a way that the financial system doesn't collapse  because of absolute uncertainty about the counter party relationships and  all of that.  But it seems perfectly appropriate to me for people who are  running private enterprises to if they do things that are substantially bad  for them to be wiped out.</p><p> CAVUTO:  We're going quite the opposite way now, right. I mean, when I was  in Washington, besides it's freezing.  As long as you folks said the next  step is to do something big to shore up support for the banking system and  I ask someone but why not just nationalize them since that is what we're  doing any way?  Taxpayers are putting in it and one of - you know, you may  not be that far off.</p><p> O'NEILL:  I tell you what, I would do something a lot bigger than that.  I  would try and find a CEO to come on your show for half an hour and dissect  their balance sheet for the American public to show that they really know  what is in it and they can attest to its underlying values.  So that if I  was running a big bank and I have $200 billion worth of commercial loans  that have been outstanding five years and I could say that these are all  performing.  I could say here is 200 billion, those are all performing.   Here's another 100 billion and there are some late payments in this segment  and so we have to mark those down.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Your argument is that their books don't look nearly as bad as  we've been led to believe.  We got this Draconian end of the world  description on the way we look at those books is unrealistic.</p><p> O'NEILL:  My argument is this, if we don't tell the truth and make it clear  that we know for certain what are a good assets it leaves the question, are  any of the assets good?  And that is why yesterday we had a 25, 30 percent  sell-off in most of the financial institutions -</p><p> CAVUTO:  We're going to keep seeing that.  They bounced back today but this  is just a roller-coaster.</p><p> O'NEILL:  You know what, I think, I'm sorry (inaudible).  I love having you  on but I do want to get to this.  Would you rescue or shore up Citigroup,  Bank of America because they got almost $100 million of taxpayer money and  they're still hurting puppies?  Would you give them more? </p><p> O'NEILL:  First of all, I would convert - any money that's been put into  these institutions on a preferred stock basis I would replace it with  federal 20-year loans with 200 basis points interest over the federal  borrowing rate and then say to the regulators counted this as permanent  capital.  And then I would get if they asked the auto companies to do, I  would get city, and JP Morgan and Bank of America to come in individually  and dissect their portfolio and to the degree that they have, maybe 20  percent of their portfolio that they can't really value, that ought to be  an open -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What about central repository?  I call it a suppository for sick  banks and their toxic assets.</p><p> O'NEILL:  Why do we want to do that?  We ought to solve them on their own  bottom.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm telling you the Obama folks are seriously considering.  </p><p> O'NEILL:  I understand they are.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And you think it's a stupid idea.</p><p> O'NEILL:  I didn't say stupid but I think but I think -</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is there a better way?</p><p> O'NEILL:  I think there's a better way, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Silly, clownish and bureaucratically the most inept thing you've  ever heard in your life?</p><p> O'NEILL:  I don't think it's the best idea.  I think solving the individual  financial institutions on their own bottom by having absolute clarity about  what we know for sure.  I give you an example.  Right now, they all report  the late pays and the (inaudible) on credit card every month.  They ought  to be able to do the same thing about all the loans that are on their books  and if they can't do that, maybe you'll tell me they can't do it and I'll  say we are really in trouble.</p><p> CAVUTO:  We're really in trouble.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying they  can't. </p><p> O'NEILL:  I don't think we need to be in that trouble.  I think we need  somebody who will stand up and tell the truth.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  As you are standing telling the truth, speaking your  mind.  What would happen to you?</p><p> O'NEILL:  Well, I tell you what.  Sometimes, it's OK to get fired if you're  telling the truth.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Well I will dodge that at all cost.  Well, thank you  very much, very good seeing you.  The former, fine treasury secretary of  this United States, Paul O'Neill.</p><p> When we come back Hillary Clinton is going to state and who is going to  fill her seat.  Does Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. know.  What would you like to  know?  We'll find out next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  As expected a bit of a battle, a back and forth, a bit  of a drama that Hillary Clinton is going to be the next Secretary of State.   The Senate overwhelmingly approving that choice.  Reaction from Robert F.  Kennedy, Jr. on her appointment because remember his cousin Caroline could  fill Hillary Clinton's Senate shoes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.:  I think Obama has himself as a good secretary of  state.  You saw her at the confirmation.  She was prepared.  She's smart.   She is quick.  She is thoughtful.  And she as we know and you know that  she's diplomatic personally.  So I think - I don't think he could have  gotten a better choice.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think this will get about eventually closing it (inaudible)  she had one view on this subject, Robert, against you know, against Gitmo  but not against closing it.  I think that was the end campaign position and  now the president, her boss is -</p><p> KENNEDY:  She's going to do what her boss wants to do.  And I think in the  long run, I saw the piece you had on before this about some of the  technical problems that's going to cause.  You know, Neil, I travel all  over the world and it has given this country such a black eye that -- that  it really is a public relations catastrophe for us and the quicker we close  it, the better.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Al these countries criticize us.  It's weird.   And they don't  want the prisoners either.</p><p> KENNEDY:  It's not only the countries, it's the people.  It's just what it  has come to symbolize that this is the way Americans torture people.  And  that's what it will always symbolize because we crossed the line that we'd  never crossed in our history before, you know.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Someone crossed the line with us, right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  After World War II, we executed Japanese officers for water  boarding Americans.  So this is a place we never torture people.  George  Washington during the revolution refused to torture British soldiers even  though they were torturing us.  Our soldiers are right here New York  Harbor.</p><p> Abraham Lincoln actually when he was confronted with the idea of torturing  people, he was so horrified that he created a commission that developed  humane standards for fair treatment of prisoners.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So bottomline -</p><p> KENNEDY: -- Later the Geneva convention.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Understood.  But you don't think this is a divisive issue between  secretary of state?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I think, absolutely that everybody I think will understand.   Anybody who has to deal with foreign government's and foreign populations  can understand that this has got to go.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Understood.  Well (inaudible).  Your cousin, Caroline, the front  runner for that supposed Senate seat that's opening up.  What do you think  of that?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I hope she gets it.  There's an electorate of one. So it's all up  to David Paterson.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What about the criticism that she got? </p><p> KENNEDY:  We're in New York, Neil.  Everybody gets criticized in New York.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why not you?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I couldn't do it.  As we discussed before I have six kids and  that is a lot of mouths to feed.  They all want to eat and they all want to  go to school.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You are a Kennedy you have money coming out of the yin yang.  No?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I've always have to make my own money.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Let's talk a little bit about the environmental stuff.   It's the reason why I got you in the beginning.  You are very gracious to  take these other questions.  The environmental push, the administration is  making it clear that while it is trying to free salaries for those members  in the administration 100 grand or more, it is still very much on track to  spend a lot of green going green.  Should it?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes.  You know, if we need an industry that's going to bring us  out of this depression.  The quickest way that we can restore the economy  in this country is to get off of foreign oil but two months ago we were  spending $700 billion a year.  We are borrowing $1 billion a day from  countries that don't like us.</p><p> CAVUTO:  How do you know that going green will make the world right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  That will make the world what?</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  With all of this strategy or technology? </p><p> KENNEDY:  If we get off of foreign oil people, everybody say OK we gave 700  billion to Citibank.  It's going to take generations to pay it back.  It's  not going to take generations.  It's going to take one year without foreign  oil.  We pay the whole thing back.  It's going to generate huge dividends  for our economy.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But what if we made a hunch on an investment that what essentially  the government is doing and it turns out to be a bad bet?</p><p> KENNEDY:  It's not a investment bet.  It is creating an infrastructure that  will allow the free market economy to function in the lowest cost producers  of energy to get into the marketplace.  They can't do that now, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But the free-market looks at it and says it is not our cup of tea.   What are we going to do?</p><p> KENNEDY:  The marketplace is already out there.  People are clamoring to  hook up.  Look at T. Boone Pickens.  You know, I'm involved with green tech  firms like Vantage Point.  They are clamoring to build wind and solar.  The  problem is we don't have a grid that can carry that energy, that can  transfer the electrons.  What we need to do is create a national grid that  is smart grid that can deploy, store and deploy energy, it will cost $150  billion to do that.</p><p> Once you do that, we have free energy in this country forever.  We never  have to go over to Saudi Arabia.  We don't have to get 4.5 trillion dollar  wars.  We don't have to spend $100 billion per year protecting pipelines.</p><p> CAVUTO: you think that this commitment to go green is going to wipe our  dependence on oil?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Oh yes, of course, it is.</p><p> CAVUTO:  How soon?</p><p> KENNEDY:  As soon as we wanted to.  Israel is doing it in three years.  If  Israel can do it.  We can do it too.  All we have to do.  Listen, in 1979,  we had no - we built and we bought days to build the Arpanet(ph), an  internet grid essentially.</p><p> The year later, 1980, there were fewer than 500 PCs in this country and IBM  said it was a dead-end technology.  But because we built the marketplace,  the grid where everybody could hook up.  Everybody in this country has PCs  today and the world has been transformed.  All we need to do is build a  national grid that can reach the big wind there, the midwest of this  country is the Saudi Arabia of when we have the most wind just in North  Dakota, Montana and Texas to provide all the energy needed -</p><p> CAVUTO:  Just in D.C.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well a lot of hot air.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  Right.  How was your Uncle's doing? </p><p> KENNEDY:  He is good.  He got out of the hospital this morning and he's on  his way to Florida.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What happened?</p><p> KENNEDY:  He had a seizure.  The doctors say its connected with fatigue and  obviously, you know, it's connected with the tumor in his brain.  It's the  same kind of seizure that he had initially that alerted us that he did have  this problem.  But he's fully recovered last night.  He was joking.  He was  you know talking and completely lucid all night and today he left for  Florida.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well does Bob Olsen(ph) think that Tim is getting a pass?  And not  on his taxes but what he plans to do with our taxes?  After this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  The market is still trying to make sense of what  President Barack Obama has in store for them.  My next guest, watch him  Geithner's confirmation hearing and say enough with this all tax nonsense,  did he pay taxes, did he not?  Get him to work right now.  Investor and  chairman of the highly regard Olstein Funds, Bob Olstein is with us.  Bob,  you said just put Tim in there, right?</p><p> BOB OLSTEIN, THE OLSTEIN FUNDS, CHAIRMAN:  You got to put him in there.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  First of all, I trust Paul Volcker and Paul Volcker said he is  good, number one.  And number two, he's got familiarity with this  situation.  I know, you think he did wrong things but they did not do the  wrong things.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Just because you have familiarity with a fire doesn't mean you  don't take responsibility for having caused it.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Let me tell you something, this fire has been caused by people in  Washington, Wall Street.  Everybody -</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  I agree with all that, Bob.  But why do all of the Wall  Street brainiacs, I put you on the top of heap, march like lemmings to this  Geithner.  He is so smart.  He is the best.  We can't wait.  There's not  another human being on the planet to do his job.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  That is not true.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I have not heard one person say, you know what, there are  other human beings down there.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And they seem to know a little.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Well now you heard it from me but right now, we got to get on  this situation.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why don't you run.  Why don't you become Treasury Secretary.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I would love it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'd nominate you.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I would love it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It's just across the street from the White House.  I will send a  letter to the president. First of all, I will pick up the phone.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  We got to attack two things, regulation of Wall Street and  marginary -</p><p> CAVUTO:  I would get to that and your little nerdy ideas of how to fix  this.  But why do you think Tim Geithner is the guy to do it?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Because he's on the scene right now.  I think that we've got to  get on the scene.  To start going through a fight right now and trying to  get new people on -</p><p> CAVUTO:  Get it to the rescuer.  If the rescue isn't working, find another  rescuer.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Well, this rescuer, he will work.  He is as good as anybody else.   He's on the top.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You just said as good as anyone else.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  That's right.</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is some pretty demeaning phrase, right?   Well that is the  best we can do right now.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Wait a second, if you have all stars and you say that this 11  all-stars out there I will pick one of 11 - this is guy is an all-star --.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I will go for the other 10.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Why are you against him?  Because he made a tax mistake? </p><p> CAVUTO:  No because he caused this whole problem to begin with.  He had a  front-row seat.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> OLSTEIN:  A front row seat at what.  You are absolutely wrong.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Wait, wait.  You know, the rescue was horrific.  Right?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  No, it was not.</p><p> CAVUTO:  OK.  All right now.  Let's get back to this comedy you call a  rescue that you think is working.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Let me say something, when a patient is dying, you got to breathe  some air into the system.  You saw what happened to Lehman.  You just said  this at your Treasury Secretary.  If you let the Lehman let go and you saw  what happened, it sent this into another tailspin.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Have you seen what's happened here Bob?  Let me tell you here.   We've given Citigroup and Bank of America almost $100 billion tax dollars.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  What if Citigroup failed?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> OLSTEIN:  What if Citigroup failed?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm just saying, they first (inaudible) when they got it.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Answer my question, what if Citigroup failed?  Do you think  Lehman (inaudible)?  What if Merrill Lynch failed?</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, if you have a job to know of all those players going with  Bob Olstein, you say money, money, money -</p><p> OLSTEIN:  (inaudible) and you had to save the system first.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Look at the system.  Take a look around here, Bob.  Take a look at  what's around.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  It's in dire straits.</p><p> CAVUTO:  These banks have lost all of that and more in market value and  lost revenue then you have given them as taxpayers.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Let me tell you something, if you didn't give them the money,  Citibank was gone.  So, is Merrill Lynch.</p><p> CAVUTO: What would Bob Olstein do now?  Assuming this guy gets in.  He's  going to get in.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  What did the depression -</p><p> CAVUTO:  What's he going to do?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  What did the depression do to this country?  What do you think  happened?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm not - you're not answering my question.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  He comes in.  Now, he's going to attack the real problem.  The  real problem started in the housing industry and that's what we got to save  right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  How would you do it?  We got $350 billion -</p><p> OLSTEIN:  You know what, you have to go in and rescue the mortgages and you  have to take first equity in these mortgages.  That is what you have to do.   Because -</p><p> CAVUTO:  So all people late on their mortgages, you're going to rescue  them?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I'm not going to rescue them, we're going to get the mortgages  and write them down to true market value and have the government be the  first out when these equity -</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well how about those who are paying the mortgages on time, are you  going to rescue them?   So are you going to rescue them?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I'm not writing down mortgages to save the people.  I'm writing  down mortgages to save the system.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  A lot of people get the benefit.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Everyone says let's get the big guys on Wall Street.  Let's kill  Lehman.  So we killed Lehman and he took all the small guys with him.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you hear what you are saying?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I absolutely do.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You are saying in order to help shore up their balance sheets,  write down these mortgages to their acceptable value today, right?</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> CAVUTO:  No, wait, you know, you're going to benefit those holders of those  mortgages at the time.  So some are going to be benefiting from Bob  Olstein's financial fix and those meanwhile who are paying their mortgages  whose mortgages are not in arrears and whose banks are not calling their  number, they are going will get the bill for the other ones who got stupid.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Who said the government is not going to take the equity in the  homes? Who said that the government is not going to take the equity?</p><p> CAVUTO:  So if someone is going to bail me out and Uncle Sam is going to -</p><p> OLSTEIN: We're not bailing you out or me out.</p><p> CAVUTO:   Fixing their books is bailing out, Bob.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  But let me ask you a question, you want to buy that bad loans.   So who are they bailing out then?</p><p> CAVUTO:  So you say this is a rescue of another name?</p><p> OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p> CAVUTO:  OK.  That I understand.  OK.  It's a rescue of another name.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  The patient is you got to rescue them or we are going under.   That's is.  I'm telling you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do see it as a slippery slope here though? </p><p> OLSTEIN:  I don't see it as a slippery slope.  I think they're dealing with  the situation as best they can.  Of course, Neil Cavuto would go in there  and would have saved the entire situation.</p><p> CAVUTO: I would have done nothing.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Well, let me tell you something.  You would not have a job now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, this fear of god is what got everyone - (inaudible) </p><p> OLSTEIN:  Let me ask you a question, how much has been written off already.   This is not the fear of God.  How much money has been put in?</p><p> CAVUTO:  How much has been given and we are still worse off than we were.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  We are worse off than you were.  You are better off than you  would have been.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You are feeding the beast.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I don't care.  I know what the beast is.  It's the problem and  the problem was started 10 and 20 years ago with all these derivatives, and  credit default swaps and getting around the system and Congressman's  saying, everybody has to be in a home.  Everybody should not be in a home.   This is -</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're going to (inaudible) that a lot of people who shouldn't be  in a home are going to be rewarded for being in a home.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  I'm not rewarding them.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, you are.  To infinity.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  All right.  What I want to do then is just kick them out and what  happens to the economics.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I would like to kick you out, you're bothering me.  No, seriously,  stick around because I want to bring in the next guest.</p><p> OLSTEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p> CAVUTO:  He says President Obama should pull Tim, and says this whole  Geithner obstruction is a waste of time and the president is wasting time  and our time, pushing in.   Peter Flaherty is the president of the national  league on policy center.  You may have heard some of our discussion.  Bob  and I do really love each other deeply.  I have enormous respect for him  but Peter, I want to get your sense of Geithner.  You're saying he's not  worth the trouble?  Get rid of him?</p><p> PETER FLAHERTY, NATIONAL LEAGUE &amp; P0LIDY CENTER PRESIDENT:  Leading the  financial meltdown aside for a moment is nothing more fundamental here.   Timothy Geithner is not qualified ethically to serve in any government  position.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why?  Because of the tax thing? </p><p> FLAHERTY:  Let's take a look at some simple facts here.  He was audited in  2006.  It was found that he did not pay his payroll taxes for the years  2001 through 2004.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I know the whole tax thing Peter -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FLAHERTY:  So what is fundamental -</p><p>  (CROSS TALK)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  So that alone disqualifies him?  Bob was saying the tax code  is very complicated.  </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  Yes, he paid two years, but then he relied on the statute  of limitation not to pay for the other two years.  And he only paid those  other two years.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  That alone --  </p><p>  (CROSS TALK)   </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  His assertion that this is unintentional does not pass the  laugh test.  At a certain point, he made a conscious decision not to pay  taxes for the years 2001 and 2002.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  He correct them.  He did pay them.  Bob, that was good enough  for you.  </p><p>  OLSSEN:  He made a mistake.  </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  It was not a mistake.  It was not a mistake.  It was a  willful tax evasion.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  He tried to say this was a mistake.  I did this, all that.   Do you think, if you put that aside, and I know it's a big thing for you to  put aside, do you think his handling of the financial rescue, being a key  participant in it, should be among the issues that disqualify him?  </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  I think it is a serious issue.  He was at Hank Paulson's  side when many of the decisions were made about these various bail outs.   During the campaign, you may remember that John McCain suggested that SEC  Chairman Chris Cox should be fired.  And Obama said, I would fire the whole  bunch.   Well, one of the bunch was Tim Geithner.  </p><p>  (CROSS TALK)</p><p>  OLSSEN:  I understand your position but I don't think it is practical  right now.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Because you say we just need to do this?  </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  We need to get on it, now rather than later. </p><p>  CAVUTO:  I'll give you another reason to fire him, always looking at  his blackberry.  You ever notice, every video shot we have, he is running  around, looking at the blackberry.  I'm just saying, you should be focused  on the financial crisis and not your blackberry.  </p><p>  OLSSEN:  Maybe they are wiring him about the financial crisis.  </p><p>  FLAHERTY:  What does it say about our new president?  The true test of  character is doing what is right when you don't have the votes, not like  right now when you do have the votes.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Peter, why don't you text message that to him.  Let the  secretary to be know that.  Bob, you're never coming on the show because  you are very nasty, but you are also very brilliant.  So you are coming  back.  Barack Obama tipping his hand on how he is going to pay for a lot of  this stimulus.  Much of the general media did not notice.  We did.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  President Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullin, General David  Petraeus in this hour in the white situation room.  The talk is about  drawing down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This on the same day he paved  the way to shut down Gitmo.  A signal that he is about to pare defense  spending and maybe a lot.  </p><p>  Let's ask John Robinson, managing editor of \"Defense Daily.\"  What do  you think?  </p><p>  JOHN ROBINSON, \"DEFENSE DAILY\":  I don't think so, Neil.  I don't  think for two reasons that he is going to cut defense spending.  One, it is  politically unacceptable for him to come after the Defense Budget during  this time of war.  Two, he has really promised to, at least at worst, keep  the defense budget steady.  As a result of those two things, politically,  and just backing up his promises, it is just not going to happen.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  If you think about, and you start paring the number of active  troop levels by 100,000 or commit to that, that's obviously a lot less  money you have to budget for that.  If you shut down or get the process  going to shut down Gitmo, much of the money is allocated to that begin to  be pared.  A trend here is what I'm saying.  You don't?  </p><p>  ROBINSON:  It's sort of a zero sum game to some extent.  A lot of  those forces move to Afghanistan.  It could be other parts of the world.   In his speech, he talked about helping other parts of the world.  Does that  mean we're going to be sending troops to Africa, other places where there  is humanitarian assistance needed?  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  You're not seeing it as a troop draw down as just a  shuffling.  </p><p>  ROBINSON:  Not at all.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Typically, that's the reaction you get when a Democrat comes  to office, defense stocks come down.  These days, all stocks are going  down.  But -- and because it is bad, because Democrats -- that is an easy  area to cut.  Or that is the rap.  You don't think that is going to be the  case?  </p><p>  ROBINSON:  Also, Neil, we're in a recession right now.  If we are  going to cut defense spending, we're going to be throwing defense workers  out of jobs.  And those are union jobs in many of these shops.  It is just  not politically going to be good.  What I think is interesting is that  defense spending really wasn't part of the stimulus package.  They could  have thrown a bunch of goodies in there to build more aircraft, build more  ships.  Really, they didn't do it.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  That is a very good point.  John Robinson, \"Defense Daily\"  managing editor.  I want to steal you back.  Very interesting insight on  this.  </p><p>  Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard not at all surprised by  the president's Gitmo move to eventually shut it down.  But he did tell me  he is watching the situation carefully.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HOWARD:  I would expect the new administration to maintain a very  strong stance against terrorism.  That is what the overwhelming majority of  the American people and America's friends around world want.  It was the  policy of President Obama during the campaign to close down Guantanamo Bay.   I can't imagine, though, that in the process of doing that there won't be  arrangements made to ensure that people charged with terrorist offenses,  crimes against American or other citizens, that those people won't be  brought to justice in some other way.  I would find it unbelievable that  other arrangements wouldn't be made.  </p><p>  I imagine, I could be wrong, but I imagine that what is in  contemplation is another arrangement for people to be brought to justice,  perhaps on the American mainland.  Now, it was the policy of the new  president to do this, having been elected.  I now have, being elected on  some explicit commitments, your first instincts are to act to implement  those commitments, whether other people agree with them or not. </p><p>  That is his policy.  Having won the ballot, he is entitled to  implement that policy.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Speaking of the new president, it was a bit of a dust-up for  you here in the United States, as well as Australia, when you came  visiting.  You were staying at Blair House.  The president-elect had wanted  to move in early to Blair House, because his two daughters were going to  start school early.  He ended up in hotel.  You were in Blair House.  What  happened?  </p><p>  HOWARD:  What happens, as I understand it -- let's face it, I was  invited by the then president as a guest to stay at Blair House.  It was a  gracious invitation.  I accepted it.  The whole thing is an enormous beat- up by sections of the media.  My understanding is, in accordance with  normal custom, there are a whole slew of events being held up at Blair  House up until a week before the inauguration.  Then the new president  moves in.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Everyone tried to blame you.  It was Howard's fault, Howard's  fault.  </p><p>  HOWARD:  All I can say is the former president was very gracious and  acting in accordance with normality in inviting me to stay there.  It is a  very great honor to have done so.  And I'm quite sure in the great scheme  of things it wouldn't have been very high on the new president's mind.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  And it wasn't.  President Obama, then President-Elect Obama,  didn't make a big deal of it.  He was very gracious, as were you.  Do you  think that President Bush, at the time when he said, no I'm not going to  move the prime minister out of Blair House, when some were saying that he  should have -- the fact that he didn't, what did you think of that?  </p><p>  HOWARD:  I don't buy into that.  Look, President Bush was gracious  enough to invite me.  I accepted the invitation.  It would have been almost  rude to have said no.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Absolutely.  </p><p>  HOWARD:  And I obviously was not seeking in any way to offend the new  president.  I don't believe I did.  And I'm just not going to buy into what  was beaten up into something by a section of the American media.  The facts  get in the way of a good story.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  As if you control where you stay.  I guess we could have put  you up at a Best Western, but we chose Blair House.  </p><p>  Let me ask you, finally then, your sense of this global respect that  Barack Obama wants in the community, something he says was lost with  President Bush.  How important is that for a leader to be liked by  everybody?  </p><p>  HOWARD:  Well, in the long run, any leader will have the impact that  his policies and his performance deserve and deliver.  I think history will  judge President Bush a lot more kindly than many of the commentators at the  present time.  With a new president, particularly President Obama being the  very African-American president in your country's history, that in itself  is a wonderful thing.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>  HOWARD:  And people are entitled to feel that way.  But he will start  his term with great goodwill, as all new president do.  Whether that is  retained over a period of time will depend entirely upon how he handles  himself.  And we all want him to succeed, because the leadership of the  United States is important to the rest of the world.  But, in the long run,  he will be judged on his performance, his policies and his record.  </p><p>  And that is how the political system works.  But he does have big  challenges.  I think the world has to be very careful in responding to this  economic crisis, that we don't commit future generations to too much  additional debt.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>  HOWARD:  It's one thing to bail things out now.  It's another thing to  pay for those debts years into the future.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right, so if Steve Jobs is hurting, than Apple has really  got to be hurting, right?  News flash.   </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right.  Shares of Apple rallying in after-hours trading.   The company just blew past many of the most robust earnings estimates.  So  is all of this hammering about Steve Jobs's health overdone?  Let's ask the  Fox Business All-Stars, Jonathan Hoenig, Howard Rosencrans, John Tabacco,  Tracy Byrnes.  </p><p>  John Tabacco, to you first.  That is a great report, firing on all  cylinders, iPods, iMacs, everything moving.  </p><p>  JOHN TOBACCO, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  You know me.  I'm always with the  evil short sellers.  I've got to say right off the bat, it is not about  Steve Jobs's health at this point.  It's about right now a lot of people  are saying iPhones stink, that the batteries stink.  The screens are  freezing up.  There was a craze of buying.  But looking out on the horizon,  one of the best innovations in the new iPhone is this Google map feature  which everyone loves.  They can hit their Zagats restaurants and everywhere  they need to go.</p><p>  But 2010 comes the Google Phone.  And there is no risk --  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  You think this is short lived.  Enjoy it now?  </p><p>  TABACCO:  I think the short sellers are seemingly agreeing today that  Apple is headed down.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Stock was up today, right?  </p><p>  TABACCO:  Today is a mere snapshot of what will happen.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Snapshot on your iPhone.  What do you make that, Howard?  </p><p>  HOWARD ROSENCRANS, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  I'm not going to bet against  Apple.  The marketing is brilliant.  I haven't heard any of these things  John has heard that had all the negative commentary associated with the  maps.  It is an amazing company.  All that said, you're talking about 10  billion dollars in an individual quarter in an economy that continues to  deteriorate at the high end.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  That was an impressive.  They sold very well in a tough  environment.  </p><p>  TABACCO:  Think about how much stimulus money we gave out last year to  buy stuff like iPhones.  Is that going to keep going?  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  We could have bought other places.  </p><p>  TABACCO:  There was great marketing, no doubt.  But you haven't heard  that the iPhones are freezing up and the batteries stink?  You haven't  heard that?  </p><p>  ROSENCRANS:  At the margin.  </p><p>  (CROSS TALK)</p><p>  TABACCO:  I hear a lot of guys switching back.  </p><p>  TRACY BYRNES, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  I think what they have done is  genius, because they were selling the Mac.  The Mac was their bread and  butter for a while.  That slowed.  They got the Phone.  Sales were up 88  percent, which is amazing.  Now that the you got the iPhone, you are going  to want to buy a Mac.  People are going to want to integrate the whole  thing.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  You see that continuing.    </p><p>  BYRNES:  I totally seeing it continuing.  But I don't see this Steve  Jobs health thing going away.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right, Jonathan Hoenig, back to Steve Jobs and whether  that is going to have a pall over the company?  People are going to start  thinking, you know, he is the guy who makes all this possible, what  happens?  </p><p>  JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  Neil, the stock has been hurt  and has been hurt very sharply even when people thought Steve Jobs's health  was a lot better.  Even with today's pop up after-hours, up about eight  percent, stock is still near a 52-week low.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  It is around 90, right?  It's highest was 185, something like  that?  </p><p>  HOENIG:  Right.  And basically this is a market performer now.  It is  13 percent of the Nasdaq 100.  Until that next technology that Tracy  alluded to --  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Really?  </p><p>  HOENIG:  It is the major tech stock.  It really is a cult stock, Neil.   Until they get that new technology out there that inspires people to line  up outside the Apple stores all over America, I don't think it is going to  be a place you make any money.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right, I was way wrong on that Apple quote.  I'm sorry.   The chart was accurate.  I wasn't.  John, at 82 or something, how low does  this thing go then?  </p><p>  TABACCO:  Maybe me and Howard should do a double or nothing on our  Lehman bet.  I would say you see 60 before 120.  </p><p>  ROSENCRANS:  I'm in your camp, John.  I'm embarrassed because of the  macro picture associated with it.  I don't see them --</p><p>  CAVUTO:  Do you guys find something weird going on here?  Apple has a  good report.  IBM optimistic looking into the next fiscal year.  These are  some big tech heavyweights that are saying, you know, the water is just  fine.  </p><p>  ROSENCRANS:  Apple came out and they made commentary on the immediate  quarter.  They don't put it out any further than that.  They're always  providing cautious commentary.  However, they did suggest a fairly powerful  quarter.  </p><p>  IBM, on the other hand, when you're talking about 29 billion dollars  in the quarter, that does make a hell of a statement.  It suggests --  because IBM can not be just an IBM story.  It has to be a decent  commentary.  Somehow they are seeing -- </p><p>  BYRNES:  If you look at the numbers, Neil, a lot of it was in their  servicing.  What that means is people in IBM's case are keeping their  computers, and having things serviced to make them last longer.  Nobody  wants to go out and buy things.  They keep putting out products, Apple.  I  keep buying them for my kids.  Stock will save up.  </p><p>  TABACCO:  So people are servicing their IBMs, but they are going to  run out and buy a Mac because they love their iPhone.  That is contrary.  </p><p>  BYRNES:  It is not.  This was the --  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Guys, we have to pay our bills here.  We're not right now.   So mixed messages from the markets to President Obama.  But the president  was pretty clear in what he wanted to tell Wall Street today.  We'll  explain.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  All right.  Down about 300 points on inauguration day.  Up  about 300 points on his first full in office.  Mixed messages from the  street to its young president.  But a clear message to Wall Street from the  president.  He is freezing salaries of any White House staff making over  100,000 dollars a year.  That is about what Hoenig makes in an hour.  </p><p>  So 100,000, is that the new rich?  Jonathan?  </p><p>  HOENIG:  Well, for Obama, Neil, that line is kind of changed for quite  a long time, right?  It was 250.  Then it went down to 200.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  I'll tell you something, Jonathan, when he first started  campaigning a couple years ago, a millionaire was rich.  You earn a million  dollars -- throughout the campaign, it went down and down.  </p><p>  HOENIG:  It keeps going lower.  Listen, every company in America,  Neil, is freezing salaries.  So on some level, I'm glad to see him taking  some responsibility for spending in Washington.  What worries me more  though is the control he is likely to exert over private sector about what  they pay their CEOs and their executives,  not to mention the hundreds of  billions of dollars that he's going to be shuffling out the door to all his  pet projects.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  I think Jonathan hit on a brilliant point.  I think what is  going on here -- you know, they always have the gap between the rich and  the poor, Tracy, I think rather than bring the bottom up, let's whack the  top down?  </p><p>  BYRNES:  If you go through even the tax proposals, not one of them,  not anything applies to anybody who makes over 200,000.  And actually, it  is at 150,000 where they start to phase out.  He is not giving anything to  the people at the top.  And as you're saying, we even hear Pelosi saying  she wants to raise taxes on the top.  So yes, he is going to try to bring  us all down into this happy minimum.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Now I have a new Machiavellian theory on that.  That was a  trial balloon for the administration to stick it to the rich sooner.  What  do you think, John?    </p><p>  TABACCO:  I say let the social engineering begin.  This is the first  in one of many moves that you'll see.  A hundred thousand, that is all you  can make.  Now we can hire a lot more 20, 30, 40 thousand dollar employees.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  Is that the message the government sends, that all of a  sudden you're saying, 100,000 sounds like a lot to us.  Do you think,  Howard, it is telling private sector, if you're cutting, go to that crowd?  </p><p>  ROSENCRANS:  Listen, it sending a nice, quote, message.  At end of the  day, though, it is pretty important to want to attract the best people to  work in this profession.  To make a commentary on what people are going to  get paid in the private sector or to it in government, to send the message  that, it is --  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  I just found out the other day what other anchors here are  being paid.  Ticks me off royally.  Jonathan Hoenig, I'm looking at that,  and I'm just saying, this could be the opening salvo to social engineering.   Or am I over-dramatizing it?  </p><p>  HOENIG:  Neil, it absolutely is.  Now, of course, the government is a  major shareholder throughout the entire financial world, in Citibank, in  Bank of America.  Believe me, the Barney Franks, the Chris Dodds, and yes,  President Obama are going to make a big deal about what those on the top,  even some of those in the middle are making in terms of salary at the end  of the day.  </p><p>  BYRNES:  Those guys in D.C. never made a lot of money to begin with.   They all make between 100 and 200 to begin with.  He's not making a --</p><p>  CAVUTO:  How long are they going to be frozen?  </p><p>  TABACCO:  Who knows?  Probably for a while.  Most government workers I  know get paid, like you said, between 100 and 200.  But they work like 20  hours a day, these guys, already.    </p><p>  CAVUTO:  A lot of them do.  </p><p>  TABACCO:  You can't make more than 100 grand.  What kind of  opportunity are you creating for these people to work as hard as you're  working now or harder, because we're in tough times.  </p><p>  BYRNES:  They're doing it for the good of the people.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  I think he is sending a message, we're pulling our belts in.  </p><p>  TABACCO:  People that should be worried are the guys like Robert  Kennedy.  We need innovation to go green and we don't have the money to get  innovation.  </p><p>  CAVUTO:  When we come back, he let his mother-in-law move into the  White House, got the Jonas Brothers to perform for his kids in the White  House, and endured two straight hours of watching a parade outside the  White House.  Policy aside, if that isn't devotion, I don't know what is. </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  CAVUTO:  Can I ask you something?  Do you like parades?  I got into a  lot of trouble last night when I said I'm not a big fan of them myself.   Nothing personal.  But they just kind of go on and on and on.  I got more  than a few marching band coordinators sick.  One of them e-mailed me to say  \"had he been there, he would have heaved a baton at my skull.\"  Said, \"I  should be more like President and Mrs. Obama.  Not only do they love a  parade, they're among the first few couples, at least that I have ever  seen, never to take their eyes off it.  Never.\"  </p><p>  I saw it for myself.  They were just about the last ones standing in  that White House reviewing stand.  I'm not kidding.  Because I was across  the street.  </p><p>  Anyway, look at this, when the parade started, all those coveted seats  in the glass enclosed stand were taken, even the cheap seats out in the  freezing cold.  Then only minutes into the parade, they all start  scattering like me at a health food store.  You've got cabinet secretaries  and social secretaries and pretty much all the secretaries, then even the  dude who was serving drinks.  </p><p>  Soon even Sasha and Malia were out of there.  The mother-in-law too.   By the parade's wee end, barely a wee soul in that stand, save the cheering  and waving and very happy Barack and Michelle Obama.  </p><p>  I didn't once see them take a break or once not acknowledge every  marcher and twirler and flipper and singer and trumpeter, not a one.  Sure,  you could say it was in their honor; they had to stay.  Actually, they  didn't.  They had inaugurals balls to go to, and since everything was  running late, really, really late, this marching madness was cutting into  what was supposed to be two hours of quiet quality time in their new home.  </p><p>  No matter.  If the band played on, they stayed on.  As my headache  from all the noise just went on and on.  I kept asking, surely they can't  take two hours of this without a break?  They just smiled and waved, as if  to say, actually, yes, we can.  Republicans be warned, if you think you can  roll these guys, think again.  They have endured more than you going on and  on.  They've endured the ultimate, parades that go on and on, even longer.   And they even looked happy doing it.  </p><p>  It's not right.  Good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

They were avoidable mistakes but they were unintentional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>NEIL CAVUTO, FBN HOST</nameText></person>: (Inaudible), Tim but fear not, you are in, Tim. <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>survives the hearing about his taxes but not enough about how he plans to spend our taxes. Tonight the man who had the job Tim wants on the screw ups should make sure he does not repeat if he wants to keep that job. Then Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. seeing red over those who question all the green going green. And they say life is a parade but does that mean we have to do what the president does and stick out through the whole darn thing? We are ready to march, now.</p><p>CAVUTO: <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>gets a grilling on the taxes he didn't pay but not nearly so much on his role in failed financial rescue in which he - well all of us continue to pay. Welcome, I am <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And here's the deal. <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>will be Treasury Secretary of the United States not because charges of sloppy bookkeeping aren't serious but because this financial crisis is even more serious. Yet at his Senate confirmation hearing today Mr. Geithner got more of a pummeling on his books than how he has helped handle the nation's books. He wasn't in charge of those books, mind you, but the very least he was a co-author, a co-signee if you will.</p><p>Our financial loans didn't loan and didn't rescue at bailouts that they themselves had to be bailed out. I'd like to hear more on how we botch those numbers than buttoning(ph) his own numbers. Some senators would carp about TARP but you asked Mr. Geithner how he would avoid another lark with TARP. And all because fear grips us and gosh Tim knows this stuff. He is smart. He is seasoned and he is ready just like Robert McMamara who led us into Vietnam and couldn't get us out. And Donald Rumsfeld who led us into Iraq without a plant o get us out.</p><p>So I'm trying to figure out this obsession with brainiacs. Take nothing away from how smart they are but how dumb maybe we are, too intimidated to think, maybe they aren't so smart especially when we can all clearly see the fall out of the financial rescue and assess for what it's been - dumb so far.</p><p>My next guest was asking these very question on TARP before it became a trap. In fact, George Bush's first Treasury Secretary had very serious questions and reservations about the rescue concocted by George Bush's last Treasury Secretary. Paul O'Neill joins me now. Well, good to have you.</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, FMR. TREASURY SECRETARY: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: First on Geithner, should he get it?</p><p>O'NEILL: He's going to get in.</p><p>CAVUTO: Should he?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think on balance, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Normally these issues - forgetting to pay your taxes and all would doom any other nominee in any other time or at least drag it out but not now because of the crisis, I guess. Should they?</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, I think as I understand the circumstances is there is to pay at some of thousands of dollars of taxes. I think as he said it is unfortunate and he wishes he had avoided but on balance I think he had to go ahead and get the job.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. Now, your argument has always been it's the big picture and I will hit the tax saying one more time with you. Part of the big picture is knowing what you run. And part of what you run is the IRS and the folks who make the tax rules.</p><p>You don't know all the rules, you know, I don't think even they do. But it still maybe they don't but still if they send a message that he does not.</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I don't know. Here is a question for you. There are 10,000 pages in the tax code, do you think there's any human being that understand the whole tax code? I don't. In the time I was secretary -</p><p>CAVUTO: The tax is -</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, Neil, I will give you an example. Do you know, that if you have an employee yourself, who cleans your house and it's against the law for you to give them a gift. Did you know, that? You probably thought you could give $10,000 a year to anyone without reporting it to the gift tax threshold. If not true, if you give your housekeeper a Christmas gift even if it's in goods, but particularly if it's in cash, say $10,000, you have to report it as wages paid and paid the withholding taxes on it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'NEILL: I'm giving you a specific thing. I'm telling you there are 10,000 pages.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not a big deal, move on, is what you are saying?</p><p>I would be ripped more for the handling of his role in the TARP funds that you are very critical about early on because what you saw what happened indeed has happened. So now we're going to release the other hundred 350 billion, the House is improving all these conditions, with strict provisos but they're going to screw up again.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, when I was here with you before I told you that I thought that it was a very big mistake for the federal government to assume preferred equity positions in financial institutions. Because I greatly fear the conversation that we heard yesterday about the Royal Bank of Scotland being nationalized by the U.K. government and with the -</p><p>CAVUTO: That is a preview of coming attractions -</p><p>O'NEILL: With the flow through into the conversation here in the U.S that the federal government would have to nationalize the bank which is the worst possible idea.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me ask you, a couple of months - when did I have you last time? I'm just trying to remember this because we were racing at the time with all rescues going on and at that time when they nixed the Lehman Brothers rescue. Here's what you had to say about that. Let's get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: What if something happens with Lehman? What if something happens with Lehman? You think -</p><p>O'NEILL: I'd let them go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes. Because I think the rest of the system is sufficiently well insulated if Lehman goes down it is a consequence for the shareholders, employer and leadership but that is OK with me.</p><p>CAVUTO: You draw the line here.</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, I think you draw the line here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now all the Monday morning quarterback are all saying you should not have done that, not you, but Lehman should have been rescued.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know, I haven't changed my mind. If you listen carefully with what I said we should let the shareholders go to zero.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>O'NEILL: I didn't intend by that that we should throw the whole financial system into chaos and I think -</p><p>CAVUTO: That's what happens this Monday morning, they were saying because that is what we did. We let them go not appreciating the fact that it would let the financial system go.</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes. I think we need to be concerned. We need to worry. We need to intervene in a way that the financial system doesn't collapse because of absolute uncertainty about the counter party relationships and all of that. But it seems perfectly appropriate to me for people who are running private enterprises to if they do things that are substantially bad for them to be wiped out.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going quite the opposite way now, right. I mean, when I was in Washington, besides it's freezing. As long as you folks said the next step is to do something big to shore up support for the banking system and I ask someone but why not just nationalize them since that is what we're doing any way? Taxpayers are putting in it and one of - you know, you may not be that far off.</p><p>O'NEILL: I tell you what, I would do something a lot bigger than that. I would try and find a CEO to come on your show for half an hour and dissect their balance sheet for the American public to show that they really know what is in it and they can attest to its underlying values. So that if I was running a big bank and I have $200 billion worth of commercial loans that have been outstanding five years and I could say that these are all performing. I could say here is 200 billion, those are all performing. Here's another 100 billion and there are some late payments in this segment and so we have to mark those down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Your argument is that their books don't look nearly as bad as we've been led to believe. We got this Draconian end of the world description on the way we look at those books is unrealistic.</p><p>O'NEILL: My argument is this, if we don't tell the truth and make it clear that we know for certain what are a good assets it leaves the question, are any of the assets good? And that is why yesterday we had a 25, 30 percent sell-off in most of the financial institutions -</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going to keep seeing that. They bounced back today but this is just a roller-coaster.</p><p>O'NEILL: You know what, I think, I'm sorry (inaudible). I love having you on but I do want to get to this. Would you rescue or shore up Citigroup, Bank of America because they got almost $100 million of taxpayer money and they're still hurting puppies? Would you give them more?</p><p>O'NEILL: First of all, I would convert - any money that's been put into these institutions on a preferred stock basis I would replace it with federal 20-year loans with 200 basis points interest over the federal borrowing rate and then say to the regulators counted this as permanent capital. And then I would get if they asked the auto companies to do, I would get city, and JP Morgan and Bank of America to come in individually and dissect their portfolio and to the degree that they have, maybe 20 percent of their portfolio that they can't really value, that ought to be an open -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: What about central repository? I call it a suppository for sick banks and their toxic assets.</p><p>O'NEILL: Why do we want to do that? We ought to solve them on their own bottom.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm telling you the Obama folks are seriously considering.</p><p>O'NEILL: I understand they are.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you think it's a stupid idea.</p><p>O'NEILL: I didn't say stupid but I think but I think -</p><p>CAVUTO: Is there a better way?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think there's a better way, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Silly, clownish and bureaucratically the most inept thing you've ever heard in your life?</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't think it's the best idea. I think solving the individual financial institutions on their own bottom by having absolute clarity about what we know for sure. I give you an example. Right now, they all report the late pays and the (inaudible) on credit card every month. They ought to be able to do the same thing about all the loans that are on their books and if they can't do that, maybe you'll tell me they can't do it and I'll say we are really in trouble.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're really in trouble. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying they can't.</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't think we need to be in that trouble. I think we need somebody who will stand up and tell the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As you are standing telling the truth, speaking your mind. What would happen to you?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I tell you what. Sometimes, it's OK to get fired if you're telling the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well I will dodge that at all cost. Well, thank you very much, very good seeing you. The former, fine treasury secretary of this United States, Paul O'Neill.</p><p>When we come back Hillary Clinton is going to state and who is going to fill her seat. Does Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. know. What would you like to know? We'll find out next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As expected a bit of a battle, a back and forth, a bit of a drama that Hillary Clinton is going to be the next Secretary of State. The Senate overwhelmingly approving that choice. Reaction from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on her appointment because remember his cousin Caroline could fill Hillary Clinton's Senate shoes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: I think Obama has himself as a good secretary of state. You saw her at the confirmation. She was prepared. She's smart. She is quick. She is thoughtful. And she as we know and you know that she's diplomatic personally. So I think - I don't think he could have gotten a better choice.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think this will get about eventually closing it (inaudible) she had one view on this subject, Robert, against you know, against Gitmo but not against closing it. I think that was the end campaign position and now the president, her boss is -</p><p>KENNEDY: She's going to do what her boss wants to do. And I think in the long run, I saw the piece you had on before this about some of the technical problems that's going to cause. You know, Neil, I travel all over the world and it has given this country such a black eye that -- that it really is a public relations catastrophe for us and the quicker we close it, the better.</p><p>CAVUTO: Al these countries criticize us. It's weird. And they don't want the prisoners either.</p><p>KENNEDY: It's not only the countries, it's the people. It's just what it has come to symbolize that this is the way Americans torture people. And that's what it will always symbolize because we crossed the line that we'd never crossed in our history before, you know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Someone crossed the line with us, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: After World War II, we executed Japanese officers for water boarding Americans. So this is a place we never torture people. George Washington during the revolution refused to torture British soldiers even though they were torturing us. Our soldiers are right here New York Harbor.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln actually when he was confronted with the idea of torturing people, he was so horrified that he created a commission that developed humane standards for fair treatment of prisoners.</p><p>CAVUTO: So bottomline -</p><p>KENNEDY: -- Later the Geneva convention.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understood. But you don't think this is a divisive issue between secretary of state?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think, absolutely that everybody I think will understand. Anybody who has to deal with foreign government's and foreign populations can understand that this has got to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understood. Well (inaudible). Your cousin, Caroline, the front runner for that supposed Senate seat that's opening up. What do you think of that?</p><p>KENNEDY: I hope she gets it. There's an electorate of one. So it's all up to David Paterson.</p><p>CAVUTO: What about the criticism that she got?</p><p>KENNEDY: We're in New York, Neil. Everybody gets criticized in New York.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why not you?</p><p>KENNEDY: I couldn't do it. As we discussed before I have six kids and that is a lot of mouths to feed. They all want to eat and they all want to go to school.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are a Kennedy you have money coming out of the yin yang. No?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I've always have to make my own money.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Let's talk a little bit about the environmental stuff. It's the reason why I got you in the beginning. You are very gracious to take these other questions. The environmental push, the administration is making it clear that while it is trying to free salaries for those members in the administration 100 grand or more, it is still very much on track to spend a lot of green going green. Should it?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. You know, if we need an industry that's going to bring us out of this depression. The quickest way that we can restore the economy in this country is to get off of foreign oil but two months ago we were spending $700 billion a year. We are borrowing $1 billion a day from countries that don't like us.</p><p>CAVUTO: How do you know that going green will make the world right?</p><p>KENNEDY: That will make the world what?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. With all of this strategy or technology? </p><p>KENNEDY: If we get off of foreign oil people, everybody say OK we gave 700 billion to Citibank. It's going to take generations to pay it back. It's not going to take generations. It's going to take one year without foreign oil. We pay the whole thing back. It's going to generate huge dividends for our economy.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what if we made a hunch on an investment that what essentially the government is doing and it turns out to be a bad bet?</p><p>KENNEDY: It's not a investment bet. It is creating an infrastructure that will allow the free market economy to function in the lowest cost producers of energy to get into the marketplace. They can't do that now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: But the free-market looks at it and says it is not our cup of tea. What are we going to do?</p><p>KENNEDY: The marketplace is already out there. People are clamoring to hook up. Look at T. Boone Pickens. You know, I'm involved with green tech firms like Vantage Point. They are clamoring to build wind and solar. The problem is we don't have a grid that can carry that energy, that can transfer the electrons. What we need to do is create a national grid that is smart grid that can deploy, store and deploy energy, it will cost $150 billion to do that.</p><p>Once you do that, we have free energy in this country forever. We never have to go over to Saudi Arabia. We don't have to get 4.5 trillion dollar wars. We don't have to spend $100 billion per year protecting pipelines.</p><p>CAVUTO: you think that this commitment to go green is going to wipe our dependence on oil?</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh yes, of course, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO: How soon?</p><p>KENNEDY: As soon as we wanted to. Israel is doing it in three years. If Israel can do it. We can do it too. All we have to do. Listen, in 1979, we had no - we built and we bought days to build the Arpanet(ph), an internet grid essentially.</p><p>The year later, 1980, there were fewer than 500 PCs in this country and IBM said it was a dead-end technology. But because we built the marketplace, the grid where everybody could hook up. Everybody in this country has PCs today and the world has been transformed. All we need to do is build a national grid that can reach the big wind there, the midwest of this country is the Saudi Arabia of when we have the most wind just in North Dakota, Montana and Texas to provide all the energy needed -</p><p>CAVUTO: Just in D.C.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well a lot of hot air.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Right. How was your Uncle's doing?</p><p>KENNEDY: He is good. He got out of the hospital this morning and he's on his way to Florida.</p><p>CAVUTO: What happened?</p><p>KENNEDY: He had a seizure. The doctors say its connected with fatigue and obviously, you know, it's connected with the tumor in his brain. It's the same kind of seizure that he had initially that alerted us that he did have this problem. But he's fully recovered last night. He was joking. He was you know talking and completely lucid all night and today he left for Florida.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well does Bob Olsen(ph) think that Tim is getting a pass? And not on his taxes but what he plans to do with our taxes? After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. The market is still trying to make sense of what President Barack Obama has in store for them. My next guest, watch him Geithner's confirmation hearing and say enough with this all tax nonsense, did he pay taxes, did he not? Get him to work right now. Investor and chairman of the highly regard Olstein Funds, Bob Olstein is with us. Bob, you said just put Tim in there, right?</p><p>BOB OLSTEIN, THE OLSTEIN FUNDS, CHAIRMAN: You got to put him in there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why?</p><p>OLSTEIN: First of all, I trust Paul Volcker and Paul Volcker said he is good, number one. And number two, he's got familiarity with this situation. I know, you think he did wrong things but they did not do the wrong things.</p><p>CAVUTO: Just because you have familiarity with a fire doesn't mean you don't take responsibility for having caused it.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me tell you something, this fire has been caused by people in Washington, Wall Street. Everybody -</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. I agree with all that, Bob. But why do all of the Wall Street brainiacs, I put you on the top of heap, march like lemmings to this Geithner. He is so smart. He is the best. We can't wait. There's not another human being on the planet to do his job.</p><p>OLSTEIN: That is not true.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I have not heard one person say, you know what, there are other human beings down there.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they seem to know a little.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well now you heard it from me but right now, we got to get on this situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why don't you run. Why don't you become Treasury Secretary.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'd nominate you.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's just across the street from the White House. I will send a letter to the president. First of all, I will pick up the phone.</p><p>OLSTEIN: We got to attack two things, regulation of Wall Street and marginary -</p><p>CAVUTO: I would get to that and your little nerdy ideas of how to fix this. But why do you think <person><nameText>Tim Geithner </nameText></person>is the guy to do it?</p><p>OLSTEIN: Because he's on the scene right now. I think that we've got to get on the scene. To start going through a fight right now and trying to get new people on -</p><p>CAVUTO: Get it to the rescuer. If the rescue isn't working, find another rescuer.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well, this rescuer, he will work. He is as good as anybody else. He's on the top.</p><p>CAVUTO: You just said as good as anyone else.</p><p>OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is some pretty demeaning phrase, right? Well that is the best we can do right now.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Wait a second, if you have all stars and you say that this 11 all-stars out there I will pick one of 11 - this is guy is an all-star --.</p><p>CAVUTO: I will go for the other 10.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Why are you against him? Because he made a tax mistake?</p><p>CAVUTO: No because he caused this whole problem to begin with. He had a front-row seat.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN: A front row seat at what. You are absolutely wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait, wait. You know, the rescue was horrific. Right?</p><p>OLSTEIN: No, it was not.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. All right now. Let's get back to this comedy you call a rescue that you think is working.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me say something, when a patient is dying, you got to breathe some air into the system. You saw what happened to Lehman. You just said this at your Treasury Secretary. If you let the Lehman let go and you saw what happened, it sent this into another tailspin.</p><p>CAVUTO: Have you seen what's happened here Bob? Let me tell you here. We've given Citigroup and Bank of America almost $100 billion tax dollars.</p><p>OLSTEIN: What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN: What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just saying, they first (inaudible) when they got it.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Answer my question, what if Citigroup failed? Do you think Lehman (inaudible)? What if Merrill Lynch failed?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if you have a job to know of all those players going with Bob Olstein, you say money, money, money -</p><p>OLSTEIN: (inaudible) and you had to save the system first.</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the system. Take a look around here, Bob. Take a look at what's around.</p><p>OLSTEIN: It's in dire straits.</p><p>CAVUTO: These banks have lost all of that and more in market value and lost revenue then you have given them as taxpayers.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me tell you something, if you didn't give them the money, Citibank was gone. So, is Merrill Lynch.</p><p>CAVUTO: What would Bob Olstein do now? Assuming this guy gets in. He's going to get in.</p><p>OLSTEIN: What did the depression -</p><p>CAVUTO: What's he going to do?</p><p>OLSTEIN: What did the depression do to this country? What do you think happened?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm not - you're not answering my question.</p><p>OLSTEIN: He comes in. Now, he's going to attack the real problem. The real problem started in the housing industry and that's what we got to save right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: How would you do it? We got $350 billion -</p><p>OLSTEIN: You know what, you have to go in and rescue the mortgages and you have to take first equity in these mortgages. That is what you have to do. Because -</p><p>CAVUTO: So all people late on their mortgages, you're going to rescue them?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not going to rescue them, we're going to get the mortgages and write them down to true market value and have the government be the first out when these equity -</p><p>CAVUTO: Well how about those who are paying the mortgages on time, are you going to rescue them? So are you going to rescue them?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not writing down mortgages to save the people. I'm writing down mortgages to save the system.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of people get the benefit.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Everyone says let's get the big guys on Wall Street. Let's kill Lehman. So we killed Lehman and he took all the small guys with him.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you hear what you are saying?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I absolutely do.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are saying in order to help shore up their balance sheets, write down these mortgages to their acceptable value today, right?</p><p>OLSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, wait, you know, you're going to benefit those holders of those mortgages at the time. So some are going to be benefiting from Bob Olstein's financial fix and those meanwhile who are paying their mortgages whose mortgages are not in arrears and whose banks are not calling their number, they are going will get the bill for the other ones who got stupid.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Who said the government is not going to take the equity in the homes? Who said that the government is not going to take the equity?</p><p>CAVUTO: So if someone is going to bail me out and Uncle Sam is going to -</p><p>OLSTEIN: We're not bailing you out or me out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Fixing their books is bailing out, Bob.</p><p>OLSTEIN: But let me ask you a question, you want to buy that bad loans. So who are they bailing out then?</p><p>CAVUTO: So you say this is a rescue of another name?</p><p>OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. That I understand. OK. It's a rescue of another name.</p><p>OLSTEIN: The patient is you got to rescue them or we are going under. That's is. I'm telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do see it as a slippery slope here though?</p><p>OLSTEIN: I don't see it as a slippery slope. I think they're dealing with the situation as best they can. Of course, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>would go in there and would have saved the entire situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: I would have done nothing.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Well, let me tell you something. You would not have a job now.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, this fear of god is what got everyone - (inaudible)</p><p>OLSTEIN: Let me ask you a question, how much has been written off already. This is not the fear of God. How much money has been put in?</p><p>CAVUTO: How much has been given and we are still worse off than we were.</p><p>OLSTEIN: We are worse off than you were. You are better off than you would have been.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are feeding the beast.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I don't care. I know what the beast is. It's the problem and the problem was started 10 and 20 years ago with all these derivatives, and credit default swaps and getting around the system and Congressman's saying, everybody has to be in a home. Everybody should not be in a home. This is -</p><p>CAVUTO: You're going to (inaudible) that a lot of people who shouldn't be in a home are going to be rewarded for being in a home.</p><p>OLSTEIN: I'm not rewarding them.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, you are. To infinity.</p><p>OLSTEIN: All right. What I want to do then is just kick them out and what happens to the economics.</p><p>CAVUTO: I would like to kick you out, you're bothering me. No, seriously, stick around because I want to bring in the next guest.</p><p>OLSTEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: He says President Obama should pull Tim, and says this whole Geithner obstruction is a waste of time and the president is wasting time and our time, pushing in. Peter Flaherty is the president of the national league on policy center. You may have heard some of our discussion. Bob and I do really love each other deeply. I have enormous respect for him but Peter, I want to get your sense of Geithner. You're saying he's not worth the trouble? Get rid of him?</p><p>PETER FLAHERTY, NATIONAL LEAGUE &amp; P0LIDY CENTER PRESIDENT: Leading the financial meltdown aside for a moment is nothing more fundamental here. Timothy Geithner is not qualified ethically to serve in any government position.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why? Because of the tax thing?</p><p>FLAHERTY: Let's take a look at some simple facts here. He was audited in 2006. It was found that he did not pay his payroll taxes for the years 2001 through 2004.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know the whole tax thing Peter -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLAHERTY: So what is fundamental -</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So that alone disqualifies him? Bob was saying the tax code is very complicated.</p><p>FLAHERTY: Yes, he paid two years, but then he relied on the statute of limitation not to pay for the other two years. And he only paid those other two years.</p><p>CAVUTO: That alone --</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>FLAHERTY: His assertion that this is unintentional does not pass the laugh test. At a certain point, he made a conscious decision not to pay taxes for the years 2001 and 2002.</p><p>CAVUTO: He correct them. He did pay them. Bob, that was good enough for you.</p><p>OLSSEN: He made a mistake.</p><p>FLAHERTY: It was not a mistake. It was not a mistake. It was a willful tax evasion.</p><p>CAVUTO: He tried to say this was a mistake. I did this, all that. Do you think, if you put that aside, and I know it's a big thing for you to put aside, do you think his handling of the financial rescue, being a key participant in it, should be among the issues that disqualify him? </p><p>FLAHERTY: I think it is a serious issue. He was at Hank Paulson's side when many of the decisions were made about these various bail outs. During the campaign, you may remember that John McCain suggested that SEC Chairman Chris Cox should be fired. And Obama said, I would fire the whole bunch. Well, one of the bunch was <person><nameText>Tim Geithner.</nameText></person></p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>OLSSEN: I understand your position but I don't think it is practical right now. </p><p>CAVUTO: Because you say we just need to do this?</p><p>FLAHERTY: We need to get on it, now rather than later.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'll give you another reason to fire him, always looking at his blackberry. You ever notice, every video shot we have, he is running around, looking at the blackberry. I'm just saying, you should be focused on the financial crisis and not your blackberry. </p><p>OLSSEN: Maybe they are wiring him about the financial crisis.</p><p>FLAHERTY: What does it say about our new president? The true test of character is doing what is right when you don't have the votes, not like right now when you do have the votes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Peter, why don't you text message that to him. Let the secretary to be know that. Bob, you're never coming on the show because you are very nasty, but you are also very brilliant. So you are coming back. Barack Obama tipping his hand on how he is going to pay for a lot of this stimulus. Much of the general media did not notice. We did.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: President Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullin, General David Petraeus in this hour in the white situation room. The talk is about drawing down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. This on the same day he paved the way to shut down Gitmo. A signal that he is about to pare defense spending and maybe a lot.</p><p>Let's ask John Robinson, managing editor of \"Defense Daily.\" What do you think?</p><p>JOHN ROBINSON, \"DEFENSE DAILY\": I don't think so, Neil. I don't think for two reasons that he is going to cut defense spending. One, it is politically unacceptable for him to come after the Defense Budget during this time of war. Two, he has really promised to, at least at worst, keep the defense budget steady. As a result of those two things, politically, and just backing up his promises, it is just not going to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you think about, and you start paring the number of active troop levels by 100,000 or commit to that, that's obviously a lot less money you have to budget for that. If you shut down or get the process going to shut down Gitmo, much of the money is allocated to that begin to be pared. A trend here is what I'm saying. You don't?</p><p>ROBINSON: It's sort of a zero sum game to some extent. A lot of those forces move to Afghanistan. It could be other parts of the world. In his speech, he talked about helping other parts of the world. Does that mean we're going to be sending troops to Africa, other places where there is humanitarian assistance needed?</p><p>CAVUTO: You're not seeing it as a troop draw down as just a shuffling.</p><p>ROBINSON: Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: Typically, that's the reaction you get when a Democrat comes to office, defense stocks come down. These days, all stocks are going down. But -- and because it is bad, because Democrats -- that is an easy area to cut. Or that is the rap. You don't think that is going to be the case?</p><p>ROBINSON: Also, Neil, we're in a recession right now. If we are going to cut defense spending, we're going to be throwing defense workers out of jobs. And those are union jobs in many of these shops. It is just not politically going to be good. What I think is interesting is that defense spending really wasn't part of the stimulus package. They could have thrown a bunch of goodies in there to build more aircraft, build more ships. Really, they didn't do it.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is a very good point. John Robinson, \"Defense Daily\" managing editor. I want to steal you back. Very interesting insight on this.</p><p>Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard not at all surprised by the president's Gitmo move to eventually shut it down. But he did tell me he is watching the situation carefully.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD: I would expect the new administration to maintain a very strong stance against terrorism. That is what the overwhelming majority of the American people and America's friends around world want. It was the policy of President Obama during the campaign to close down Guantanamo Bay. I can't imagine, though, that in the process of doing that there won't be arrangements made to ensure that people charged with terrorist offenses, crimes against American or other citizens, that those people won't be brought to justice in some other way. I would find it unbelievable that other arrangements wouldn't be made.</p><p>I imagine, I could be wrong, but I imagine that what is in contemplation is another arrangement for people to be brought to justice, perhaps on the American mainland. Now, it was the policy of the new president to do this, having been elected. I now have, being elected on some explicit commitments, your first instincts are to act to implement those commitments, whether other people agree with them or not.</p><p>That is his policy. Having won the ballot, he is entitled to implement that policy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Speaking of the new president, it was a bit of a dust-up for you here in the United States, as well as Australia, when you came visiting. You were staying at Blair House. The president-elect had wanted to move in early to Blair House, because his two daughters were going to start school early. He ended up in hotel. You were in Blair House. What happened?</p><p>HOWARD: What happens, as I understand it -- let's face it, I was invited by the then president as a guest to stay at Blair House. It was a gracious invitation. I accepted it. The whole thing is an enormous beat- up by sections of the media. My understanding is, in accordance with normal custom, there are a whole slew of events being held up at Blair House up until a week before the inauguration. Then the new president moves in.</p><p>CAVUTO: Everyone tried to blame you. It was Howard's fault, Howard's fault.</p><p>HOWARD: All I can say is the former president was very gracious and acting in accordance with normality in inviting me to stay there. It is a very great honor to have done so. And I'm quite sure in the great scheme of things it wouldn't have been very high on the new president's mind.</p><p>CAVUTO: And it wasn't. President Obama, then President-Elect Obama, didn't make a big deal of it. He was very gracious, as were you. Do you think that President Bush, at the time when he said, no I'm not going to move the prime minister out of Blair House, when some were saying that he should have -- the fact that he didn't, what did you think of that?</p><p>HOWARD: I don't buy into that. Look, President Bush was gracious enough to invite me. I accepted the invitation. It would have been almost rude to have said no.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>HOWARD: And I obviously was not seeking in any way to offend the new president. I don't believe I did. And I'm just not going to buy into what was beaten up into something by a section of the American media. The facts get in the way of a good story.</p><p>CAVUTO: As if you control where you stay. I guess we could have put you up at a Best Western, but we chose Blair House.</p><p>Let me ask you, finally then, your sense of this global respect that Barack Obama wants in the community, something he says was lost with President Bush. How important is that for a leader to be liked by everybody?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, in the long run, any leader will have the impact that his policies and his performance deserve and deliver. I think history will judge President Bush a lot more kindly than many of the commentators at the present time. With a new president, particularly President Obama being the very African-American president in your country's history, that in itself is a wonderful thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>HOWARD: And people are entitled to feel that way. But he will start his term with great goodwill, as all new president do. Whether that is retained over a period of time will depend entirely upon how he handles himself. And we all want him to succeed, because the leadership of the United States is important to the rest of the world. But, in the long run, he will be judged on his performance, his policies and his record.</p><p>And that is how the political system works. But he does have big challenges. I think the world has to be very careful in responding to this economic crisis, that we don't commit future generations to too much additional debt.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>HOWARD: It's one thing to bail things out now. It's another thing to pay for those debts years into the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so if Steve Jobs is hurting, than Apple has really got to be hurting, right? News flash. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Shares of Apple rallying in after-hours trading. The company just blew past many of the most robust earnings estimates. So is all of this hammering about Steve Jobs's health overdone? Let's ask the Fox Business All-Stars, Jonathan Hoenig, Howard Rosencrans, John Tabacco, Tracy Byrnes.</p><p>John Tabacco, to you first. That is a great report, firing on all cylinders, iPods, iMacs, everything moving.</p><p>JOHN TOBACCO, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: You know me. I'm always with the evil short sellers. I've got to say right off the bat, it is not about Steve Jobs's health at this point. It's about right now a lot of people are saying iPhones stink, that the batteries stink. The screens are freezing up. There was a craze of buying. But looking out on the horizon, one of the best innovations in the new iPhone is this Google map feature which everyone loves. They can hit their Zagats restaurants and everywhere they need to go.</p><p>But 2010 comes the Google Phone. And there is no risk --</p><p>CAVUTO: You think this is short lived. Enjoy it now?</p><p>TABACCO: I think the short sellers are seemingly agreeing today that Apple is headed down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Stock was up today, right?</p><p>TABACCO: Today is a mere snapshot of what will happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Snapshot on your iPhone. What do you make that, Howard?</p><p>HOWARD ROSENCRANS, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: I'm not going to bet against Apple. The marketing is brilliant. I haven't heard any of these things John has heard that had all the negative commentary associated with the maps. It is an amazing company. All that said, you're talking about 10 billion dollars in an individual quarter in an economy that continues to deteriorate at the high end.</p><p>CAVUTO: That was an impressive. They sold very well in a tough environment.</p><p>TABACCO: Think about how much stimulus money we gave out last year to buy stuff like iPhones. Is that going to keep going?</p><p>CAVUTO: We could have bought other places.</p><p>TABACCO: There was great marketing, no doubt. But you haven't heard that the iPhones are freezing up and the batteries stink? You haven't heard that?</p><p>ROSENCRANS: At the margin.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>TABACCO: I hear a lot of guys switching back.</p><p>TRACY BYRNES, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: I think what they have done is genius, because they were selling the Mac. The Mac was their bread and butter for a while. That slowed. They got the Phone. Sales were up 88 percent, which is amazing. Now that the you got the iPhone, you are going to want to buy a Mac. People are going to want to integrate the whole thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: You see that continuing.</p><p>BYRNES: I totally seeing it continuing. But I don't see this Steve Jobs health thing going away.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Jonathan Hoenig, back to Steve Jobs and whether that is going to have a pall over the company? People are going to start thinking, you know, he is the guy who makes all this possible, what happens?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST: Neil, the stock has been hurt and has been hurt very sharply even when people thought Steve Jobs's health was a lot better. Even with today's pop up after-hours, up about eight percent, stock is still near a 52-week low.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is around 90, right? It's highest was 185, something like that?</p><p>HOENIG: Right. And basically this is a market performer now. It is 13 percent of the Nasdaq 100. Until that next technology that Tracy alluded to --</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>HOENIG: It is the major tech stock. It really is a cult stock, Neil. Until they get that new technology out there that inspires people to line up outside the Apple stores all over America, I don't think it is going to be a place you make any money.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I was way wrong on that Apple quote. I'm sorry. The chart was accurate. I wasn't. John, at 82 or something, how low does this thing go then?</p><p>TABACCO: Maybe me and Howard should do a double or nothing on our Lehman bet. I would say you see 60 before 120.</p><p>ROSENCRANS: I'm in your camp, John. I'm embarrassed because of the macro picture associated with it. I don't see them --</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you guys find something weird going on here? Apple has a good report. IBM optimistic looking into the next fiscal year. These are some big tech heavyweights that are saying, you know, the water is just fine.</p><p>ROSENCRANS: Apple came out and they made commentary on the immediate quarter. They don't put it out any further than that. They're always providing cautious commentary. However, they did suggest a fairly powerful quarter.</p><p>IBM, on the other hand, when you're talking about 29 billion dollars in the quarter, that does make a hell of a statement. It suggests -- because IBM can not be just an IBM story. It has to be a decent commentary. Somehow they are seeing --</p><p>BYRNES: If you look at the numbers, Neil, a lot of it was in their servicing. What that means is people in IBM's case are keeping their computers, and having things serviced to make them last longer. Nobody wants to go out and buy things. They keep putting out products, Apple. I keep buying them for my kids. Stock will save up.</p><p>TABACCO: So people are servicing their IBMs, but they are going to run out and buy a Mac because they love their iPhone. That is contrary.</p><p>BYRNES: It is not. This was the --</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, we have to pay our bills here. We're not right now. So mixed messages from the markets to President Obama. But the president was pretty clear in what he wanted to tell Wall Street today. We'll explain.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Down about 300 points on inauguration day. Up about 300 points on his first full in office. Mixed messages from the street to its young president. But a clear message to Wall Street from the president. He is freezing salaries of any White House staff making over 100,000 dollars a year. That is about what Hoenig makes in an hour.</p><p>So 100,000, is that the new rich? Jonathan?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, for Obama, Neil, that line is kind of changed for quite a long time, right? It was 250. Then it went down to 200.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'll tell you something, Jonathan, when he first started campaigning a couple years ago, a millionaire was rich. You earn a million dollars -- throughout the campaign, it went down and down.</p><p>HOENIG: It keeps going lower. Listen, every company in America, Neil, is freezing salaries. So on some level, I'm glad to see him taking some responsibility for spending in Washington. What worries me more though is the control he is likely to exert over private sector about what they pay their CEOs and their executives, not to mention the hundreds of billions of dollars that he's going to be shuffling out the door to all his pet projects.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think Jonathan hit on a brilliant point. I think what is going on here -- you know, they always have the gap between the rich and the poor, Tracy, I think rather than bring the bottom up, let's whack the top down?</p><p>BYRNES: If you go through even the tax proposals, not one of them, not anything applies to anybody who makes over 200,000. And actually, it is at 150,000 where they start to phase out. He is not giving anything to the people at the top. And as you're saying, we even hear Pelosi saying she wants to raise taxes on the top. So yes, he is going to try to bring us all down into this happy minimum.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now I have a new Machiavellian theory on that. That was a trial balloon for the administration to stick it to the rich sooner. What do you think, John?</p><p>TABACCO: I say let the social engineering begin. This is the first in one of many moves that you'll see. A hundred thousand, that is all you can make. Now we can hire a lot more 20, 30, 40 thousand dollar employees.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that the message the government sends, that all of a sudden you're saying, 100,000 sounds like a lot to us. Do you think, Howard, it is telling private sector, if you're cutting, go to that crowd?</p><p>ROSENCRANS: Listen, it sending a nice, quote, message. At end of the day, though, it is pretty important to want to attract the best people to work in this profession. To make a commentary on what people are going to get paid in the private sector or to it in government, to send the message that, it is --</p><p>CAVUTO: I just found out the other day what other anchors here are being paid. Ticks me off royally. Jonathan Hoenig, I'm looking at that, and I'm just saying, this could be the opening salvo to social engineering. Or am I over-dramatizing it?</p><p>HOENIG: Neil, it absolutely is. Now, of course, the government is a major shareholder throughout the entire financial world, in Citibank, in Bank of America. Believe me, the Barney Franks, the Chris Dodds, and yes, President Obama are going to make a big deal about what those on the top, even some of those in the middle are making in terms of salary at the end of the day.</p><p>BYRNES: Those guys in D.C. never made a lot of money to begin with. They all make between 100 and 200 to begin with. He's not making a --</p><p>CAVUTO: How long are they going to be frozen?</p><p>TABACCO: Who knows? Probably for a while. Most government workers I know get paid, like you said, between 100 and 200. But they work like 20 hours a day, these guys, already.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of them do.</p><p>TABACCO: You can't make more than 100 grand. What kind of opportunity are you creating for these people to work as hard as you're working now or harder, because we're in tough times.</p><p>BYRNES: They're doing it for the good of the people.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think he is sending a message, we're pulling our belts in.</p><p>TABACCO: People that should be worried are the guys like Robert Kennedy. We need innovation to go green and we don't have the money to get innovation.</p><p>CAVUTO: When we come back, he let his mother-in-law move into the White House, got the Jonas Brothers to perform for his kids in the White House, and endured two straight hours of watching a parade outside the White House. Policy aside, if that isn't devotion, I don't know what is.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Can I ask you something? Do you like parades? I got into a lot of trouble last night when I said I'm not a big fan of them myself. Nothing personal. But they just kind of go on and on and on. I got more than a few marching band coordinators sick. One of them e-mailed me to say \"had he been there, he would have heaved a baton at my skull.\" Said, \"I should be more like President and Mrs. Obama. Not only do they love a parade, they're among the first few couples, at least that I have ever seen, never to take their eyes off it. Never.\"</p><p>I saw it for myself. They were just about the last ones standing in that White House reviewing stand. I'm not kidding. Because I was across the street.</p><p>Anyway, look at this, when the parade started, all those coveted seats in the glass enclosed stand were taken, even the cheap seats out in the freezing cold. Then only minutes into the parade, they all start scattering like me at a health food store. You've got cabinet secretaries and social secretaries and pretty much all the secretaries, then even the dude who was serving drinks.</p><p>Soon even Sasha and Malia were out of there. The mother-in-law too. By the parade's wee end, barely a wee soul in that stand, save the cheering and waving and very happy Barack and Michelle Obama.</p><p>I didn't once see them take a break or once not acknowledge every marcher and twirler and flipper and singer and trumpeter, not a one. Sure, you could say it was in their honor; they had to stay. Actually, they didn't. They had inaugurals balls to go to, and since everything was running late, really, really late, this marching madness was cutting into what was supposed to be two hours of quiet quality time in their new home.</p><p>No matter. If the band played on, they stayed on. As my headache from all the noise just went on and on. I kept asking, surely they can't take two hours of this without a break? They just smiled and waved, as if to say, actually, yes, we can. Republicans be warned, if you think you can roll these guys, think again. They have endured more than you going on and on. They've endured the ultimate, parades that go on and on, even longer. And they even looked happy doing it.</p><p>It's not right. Good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

They were avoidable mistakes but they were unintentional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, FBN HOST:  (Inaudible), Tim but fear not, you are in, Tim.   Tim Geithner survives the hearing about his taxes but not enough about how  he plans to spend our taxes.  Tonight the man who had the job Tim wants on  the screw ups should make sure he does not repeat if he wants to keep that  job.  Then Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. seeing red over those who question all  the green going green.  And they say life is a parade but does that mean we  have to do what the president does and stick out through the whole darn  thing?  We are ready to march, now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Tim Geithner gets a grilling on the taxes he didn't pay but not  nearly so much on his role in failed financial rescue in which he - well  all of us continue to pay.  Welcome, I am Neil Cavuto.  And here's the  deal.  Tim Geithner will be Treasury Secretary of the United States not  because charges of sloppy bookkeeping aren't serious but because this  financial crisis is even more serious.  Yet at his Senate confirmation  hearing today Mr. Geithner got more of a pummeling on his books than how he  has helped handle the nation's books.  He wasn't in charge of those books,  mind you, but the very least he was a co-author, a co-signee if you will.</p><p>Our financial loans didn't loan and didn't rescue at bailouts that they  themselves had to be bailed out.  I'd like to hear more on how we botch  those numbers than buttoning(ph) his own numbers.  Some senators would carp  about TARP but you asked Mr. Geithner how he would avoid another lark with  TARP.  And all because fear grips us and gosh Tim knows this stuff.  He is  smart.  He is seasoned and he is ready just like Robert McMamara who led us  into Vietnam and couldn't get us out.  And Donald Rumsfeld who led us into  Iraq without a plant o get us out.</p><p>So I'm trying to figure out this obsession with brainiacs.  Take nothing  away from how smart they are but how dumb maybe we are, too intimidated to  think, maybe they aren't so smart especially when we can all clearly see  the fall out of the financial rescue and assess for what it's been - dumb  so far.</p><p>My next guest was asking these very question on TARP before it became a  trap.  In fact, George Bush's first Treasury Secretary had very serious  questions and reservations about the rescue concocted by George Bush's last  Treasury Secretary.  Paul O'Neill joins me now.  Well, good to have you.</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, FMR. TREASURY SECRETARY:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  First on Geithner, should he get it?</p><p>O'NEILL:  He's going to get in.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Should he?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I think on balance, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Normally these issues - forgetting to pay your taxes and all would  doom any other nominee in any other time or at least drag it out but not  now because of the crisis, I guess.  Should they?</p><p>O'NEILL:  You know, I think as I understand the circumstances is there is  to pay at some of thousands of dollars of taxes.  I think as he said it is  unfortunate and he wishes he had avoided but on balance I think he had to  go ahead and get the job.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  Now, your argument has always been it's the big picture and I  will hit the tax saying one more time with you.  Part of the big picture is  knowing what you run.  And part of what you run is the IRS and the folks  who make the tax rules.</p><p>You don't know all the rules, you know, I don't think even they do.  But it  still maybe they don't but still if they send a message that he does not.  </p><p>O'NEILL:  Well, I don't know.  Here is a question for you.  There are  10,000 pages in the tax code, do you think there's any human being that  understand the whole tax code?  I don't. In the time I was secretary -</p><p>CAVUTO:  The tax is - </p><p>O'NEILL:  Well, Neil, I will give you an example.  Do you know, that if you  have an employee yourself, who cleans your house and it's against the law  for you to give them a gift.  Did you know, that?  You probably thought you  could give $10,000 a year to anyone without reporting it to the gift tax  threshold.  If not true, if  you give your housekeeper a Christmas gift  even if it's in goods, but particularly if it's in cash, say $10,000, you  have to report it as wages paid and paid the withholding taxes on it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'NEILL:  I'm giving you a specific thing.  I'm telling you there are  10,000 pages.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not a big deal, move on, is what you are saying?</p><p>I would be ripped more for the handling of his role in the TARP funds that  you are very critical about early on because what you saw what happened  indeed has happened.  So now we're going to release the other hundred 350  billion, the House is improving all these conditions, with strict provisos  but they're going to screw up again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  You know, when I was here with you before I told you that I  thought that it was a very big mistake for the federal government to assume  preferred equity positions in financial institutions.  Because I greatly  fear the conversation that we heard yesterday about the Royal Bank of  Scotland being nationalized by the U.K. government and with the -</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is a preview of coming attractions -</p><p>O'NEILL:  With the flow through into the conversation here in the U.S that  the federal government would have to nationalize the bank which is the  worst possible idea.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, let me ask you, a couple of months - when did I have you  last time? I'm just trying to remember this because we were racing at the  time with all rescues going on and at that time when they nixed the Lehman  Brothers rescue.  Here's what you had to say about that.  Let's get your  reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What if something happens with Lehman?  What if something happens  with Lehman?  You think -</p><p>O'NEILL:  I'd let them go.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?</p><p>O'NEILL:  Yes.  Because I think the rest of the system is sufficiently well  insulated if Lehman goes down it is a consequence for the shareholders,  employer and leadership but that is OK with me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You draw the line here.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Yes, I think you draw the line here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now all the Monday morning quarterback are all saying you should  not have done that, not you, but Lehman should have been rescued.</p><p>O'NEILL:  You know, I haven't changed my mind.  If you listen carefully  with what I said we should let the shareholders go to zero.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>O'NEILL:  I didn't intend by that that we should throw the whole financial  system into chaos and I think -</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's what happens this Monday morning, they were saying because  that is what we did.  We let them go not appreciating the fact that it  would let the financial system go.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Yes.  I think we need to be concerned.  We need to worry.  We  need to intervene in a way that the financial system doesn't collapse  because of absolute uncertainty about the counter party relationships and  all of that.  But it seems perfectly appropriate to me for people who are  running private enterprises to if they do things that are substantially bad  for them to be wiped out.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We're going quite the opposite way now, right. I mean, when I was  in Washington, besides it's freezing.  As long as you folks said the next  step is to do something big to shore up support for the banking system and  I ask someone but why not just nationalize them since that is what we're  doing any way?  Taxpayers are putting in it and one of - you know, you may  not be that far off.</p><p>O'NEILL:  I tell you what, I would do something a lot bigger than that.  I  would try and find a CEO to come on your show for half an hour and dissect  their balance sheet for the American public to show that they really know  what is in it and they can attest to its underlying values.  So that if I  was running a big bank and I have $200 billion worth of commercial loans  that have been outstanding five years and I could say that these are all  performing.  I could say here is 200 billion, those are all performing.   Here's another 100 billion and there are some late payments in this segment  and so we have to mark those down.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Your argument is that their books don't look nearly as bad as  we've been led to believe.  We got this Draconian end of the world  description on the way we look at those books is unrealistic.</p><p>O'NEILL:  My argument is this, if we don't tell the truth and make it clear  that we know for certain what are a good assets it leaves the question, are  any of the assets good?  And that is why yesterday we had a 25, 30 percent  sell-off in most of the financial institutions -</p><p>CAVUTO:  We're going to keep seeing that.  They bounced back today but this  is just a roller-coaster.</p><p>O'NEILL:  You know what, I think, I'm sorry (inaudible).  I love having you  on but I do want to get to this.  Would you rescue or shore up Citigroup,  Bank of America because they got almost $100 million of taxpayer money and  they're still hurting puppies?  Would you give them more? </p><p>O'NEILL:  First of all, I would convert - any money that's been put into  these institutions on a preferred stock basis I would replace it with  federal 20-year loans with 200 basis points interest over the federal  borrowing rate and then say to the regulators counted this as permanent  capital.  And then I would get if they asked the auto companies to do, I  would get city, and JP Morgan and Bank of America to come in individually  and dissect their portfolio and to the degree that they have, maybe 20  percent of their portfolio that they can't really value, that ought to be  an open -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What about central repository?  I call it a suppository for sick  banks and their toxic assets.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Why do we want to do that?  We ought to solve them on their own  bottom.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm telling you the Obama folks are seriously considering.  </p><p>O'NEILL:  I understand they are.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And you think it's a stupid idea.</p><p>O'NEILL:  I didn't say stupid but I think but I think -</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is there a better way?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I think there's a better way, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Silly, clownish and bureaucratically the most inept thing you've  ever heard in your life?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I don't think it's the best idea.  I think solving the individual  financial institutions on their own bottom by having absolute clarity about  what we know for sure.  I give you an example.  Right now, they all report  the late pays and the (inaudible) on credit card every month.  They ought  to be able to do the same thing about all the loans that are on their books  and if they can't do that, maybe you'll tell me they can't do it and I'll  say we are really in trouble.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We're really in trouble.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying they  can't. </p><p>O'NEILL:  I don't think we need to be in that trouble.  I think we need  somebody who will stand up and tell the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  As you are standing telling the truth, speaking your  mind.  What would happen to you?</p><p>O'NEILL:  Well, I tell you what.  Sometimes, it's OK to get fired if you're  telling the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well I will dodge that at all cost.  Well, thank you  very much, very good seeing you.  The former, fine treasury secretary of  this United States, Paul O'Neill.</p><p>When we come back Hillary Clinton is going to state and who is going to  fill her seat.  Does Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. know.  What would you like to  know?  We'll find out next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  As expected a bit of a battle, a back and forth, a bit  of a drama that Hillary Clinton is going to be the next Secretary of State.   The Senate overwhelmingly approving that choice.  Reaction from Robert F.  Kennedy, Jr. on her appointment because remember his cousin Caroline could  fill Hillary Clinton's Senate shoes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.:  I think Obama has himself as a good secretary of  state.  You saw her at the confirmation.  She was prepared.  She's smart.   She is quick.  She is thoughtful.  And she as we know and you know that  she's diplomatic personally.  So I think - I don't think he could have  gotten a better choice.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think this will get about eventually closing it (inaudible)  she had one view on this subject, Robert, against you know, against Gitmo  but not against closing it.  I think that was the end campaign position and  now the president, her boss is -</p><p>KENNEDY:  She's going to do what her boss wants to do.  And I think in the  long run, I saw the piece you had on before this about some of the  technical problems that's going to cause.  You know, Neil, I travel all  over the world and it has given this country such a black eye that -- that  it really is a public relations catastrophe for us and the quicker we close  it, the better.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Al these countries criticize us.  It's weird.   And they don't  want the prisoners either.</p><p>KENNEDY:  It's not only the countries, it's the people.  It's just what it  has come to symbolize that this is the way Americans torture people.  And  that's what it will always symbolize because we crossed the line that we'd  never crossed in our history before, you know.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Someone crossed the line with us, right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  After World War II, we executed Japanese officers for water  boarding Americans.  So this is a place we never torture people.  George  Washington during the revolution refused to torture British soldiers even  though they were torturing us.  Our soldiers are right here New York  Harbor.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln actually when he was confronted with the idea of torturing  people, he was so horrified that he created a commission that developed  humane standards for fair treatment of prisoners.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So bottomline -</p><p>KENNEDY: -- Later the Geneva convention.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Understood.  But you don't think this is a divisive issue between  secretary of state?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I think, absolutely that everybody I think will understand.   Anybody who has to deal with foreign government's and foreign populations  can understand that this has got to go.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Understood.  Well (inaudible).  Your cousin, Caroline, the front  runner for that supposed Senate seat that's opening up.  What do you think  of that?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I hope she gets it.  There's an electorate of one. So it's all up  to David Paterson.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What about the criticism that she got? </p><p>KENNEDY:  We're in New York, Neil.  Everybody gets criticized in New York.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why not you?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I couldn't do it.  As we discussed before I have six kids and  that is a lot of mouths to feed.  They all want to eat and they all want to  go to school.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You are a Kennedy you have money coming out of the yin yang.  No?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, I've always have to make my own money.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Let's talk a little bit about the environmental stuff.   It's the reason why I got you in the beginning.  You are very gracious to  take these other questions.  The environmental push, the administration is  making it clear that while it is trying to free salaries for those members  in the administration 100 grand or more, it is still very much on track to  spend a lot of green going green.  Should it?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  You know, if we need an industry that's going to bring us  out of this depression.  The quickest way that we can restore the economy  in this country is to get off of foreign oil but two months ago we were  spending $700 billion a year.  We are borrowing $1 billion a day from  countries that don't like us.</p><p>CAVUTO:  How do you know that going green will make the world right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  That will make the world what?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  With all of this strategy or technology? </p><p>KENNEDY:  If we get off of foreign oil people, everybody say OK we gave 700  billion to Citibank.  It's going to take generations to pay it back.  It's  not going to take generations.  It's going to take one year without foreign  oil.  We pay the whole thing back.  It's going to generate huge dividends  for our economy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But what if we made a hunch on an investment that what essentially  the government is doing and it turns out to be a bad bet?</p><p>KENNEDY:  It's not a investment bet.  It is creating an infrastructure that  will allow the free market economy to function in the lowest cost producers  of energy to get into the marketplace.  They can't do that now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But the free-market looks at it and says it is not our cup of tea.   What are we going to do?</p><p>KENNEDY:  The marketplace is already out there.  People are clamoring to  hook up.  Look at T. Boone Pickens.  You know, I'm involved with green tech  firms like Vantage Point.  They are clamoring to build wind and solar.  The  problem is we don't have a grid that can carry that energy, that can  transfer the electrons.  What we need to do is create a national grid that  is smart grid that can deploy, store and deploy energy, it will cost $150  billion to do that.</p><p>Once you do that, we have free energy in this country forever.  We never  have to go over to Saudi Arabia.  We don't have to get 4.5 trillion dollar  wars.  We don't have to spend $100 billion per year protecting pipelines.</p><p>CAVUTO: you think that this commitment to go green is going to wipe our  dependence on oil?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Oh yes, of course, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO:  How soon?</p><p>KENNEDY:  As soon as we wanted to.  Israel is doing it in three years.  If  Israel can do it.  We can do it too.  All we have to do.  Listen, in 1979,  we had no - we built and we bought days to build the Arpanet(ph), an  internet grid essentially.</p><p>The year later, 1980, there were fewer than 500 PCs in this country and IBM  said it was a dead-end technology.  But because we built the marketplace,  the grid where everybody could hook up.  Everybody in this country has PCs  today and the world has been transformed.  All we need to do is build a  national grid that can reach the big wind there, the midwest of this  country is the Saudi Arabia of when we have the most wind just in North  Dakota, Montana and Texas to provide all the energy needed -</p><p>CAVUTO:  Just in D.C.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Well a lot of hot air.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  Right.  How was your Uncle's doing? </p><p>KENNEDY:  He is good.  He got out of the hospital this morning and he's on  his way to Florida.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What happened?</p><p>KENNEDY:  He had a seizure.  The doctors say its connected with fatigue and  obviously, you know, it's connected with the tumor in his brain.  It's the  same kind of seizure that he had initially that alerted us that he did have  this problem.  But he's fully recovered last night.  He was joking.  He was  you know talking and completely lucid all night and today he left for  Florida.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well does Bob Olsen(ph) think that Tim is getting a pass?  And not  on his taxes but what he plans to do with our taxes?  After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  The market is still trying to make sense of what  President Barack Obama has in store for them.  My next guest, watch him  Geithner's confirmation hearing and say enough with this all tax nonsense,  did he pay taxes, did he not?  Get him to work right now.  Investor and  chairman of the highly regard Olstein Funds, Bob Olstein is with us.  Bob,  you said just put Tim in there, right?</p><p>BOB OLSTEIN, THE OLSTEIN FUNDS, CHAIRMAN:  You got to put him in there.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  First of all, I trust Paul Volcker and Paul Volcker said he is  good, number one.  And number two, he's got familiarity with this  situation.  I know, you think he did wrong things but they did not do the  wrong things.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Just because you have familiarity with a fire doesn't mean you  don't take responsibility for having caused it.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Let me tell you something, this fire has been caused by people in  Washington, Wall Street.  Everybody -</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  I agree with all that, Bob.  But why do all of the Wall  Street brainiacs, I put you on the top of heap, march like lemmings to this  Geithner.  He is so smart.  He is the best.  We can't wait.  There's not  another human being on the planet to do his job.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  That is not true.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I have not heard one person say, you know what, there are  other human beings down there.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And they seem to know a little.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Well now you heard it from me but right now, we got to get on  this situation.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why don't you run.  Why don't you become Treasury Secretary.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'd nominate you.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I would love it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's just across the street from the White House.  I will send a  letter to the president. First of all, I will pick up the phone.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  We got to attack two things, regulation of Wall Street and  marginary -</p><p>CAVUTO:  I would get to that and your little nerdy ideas of how to fix  this.  But why do you think Tim Geithner is the guy to do it?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Because he's on the scene right now.  I think that we've got to  get on the scene.  To start going through a fight right now and trying to  get new people on -</p><p>CAVUTO:  Get it to the rescuer.  If the rescue isn't working, find another  rescuer.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Well, this rescuer, he will work.  He is as good as anybody else.   He's on the top.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You just said as good as anyone else.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is some pretty demeaning phrase, right?   Well that is the  best we can do right now.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Wait a second, if you have all stars and you say that this 11  all-stars out there I will pick one of 11 - this is guy is an all-star --.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I will go for the other 10.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Why are you against him?  Because he made a tax mistake? </p><p>CAVUTO:  No because he caused this whole problem to begin with.  He had a  front-row seat.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN:  A front row seat at what.  You are absolutely wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wait, wait.  You know, the rescue was horrific.  Right?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  No, it was not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  All right now.  Let's get back to this comedy you call a  rescue that you think is working.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Let me say something, when a patient is dying, you got to breathe  some air into the system.  You saw what happened to Lehman.  You just said  this at your Treasury Secretary.  If you let the Lehman let go and you saw  what happened, it sent this into another tailspin.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Have you seen what's happened here Bob?  Let me tell you here.   We've given Citigroup and Bank of America almost $100 billion tax dollars.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OLSTEIN:  What if Citigroup failed?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm just saying, they first (inaudible) when they got it.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Answer my question, what if Citigroup failed?  Do you think  Lehman (inaudible)?  What if Merrill Lynch failed?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, if you have a job to know of all those players going with  Bob Olstein, you say money, money, money -</p><p>OLSTEIN:  (inaudible) and you had to save the system first.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Look at the system.  Take a look around here, Bob.  Take a look at  what's around.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  It's in dire straits.</p><p>CAVUTO:  These banks have lost all of that and more in market value and  lost revenue then you have given them as taxpayers.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Let me tell you something, if you didn't give them the money,  Citibank was gone.  So, is Merrill Lynch.</p><p>CAVUTO: What would Bob Olstein do now?  Assuming this guy gets in.  He's  going to get in.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  What did the depression -</p><p>CAVUTO:  What's he going to do?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  What did the depression do to this country?  What do you think  happened?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm not - you're not answering my question.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  He comes in.  Now, he's going to attack the real problem.  The  real problem started in the housing industry and that's what we got to save  right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  How would you do it?  We got $350 billion -</p><p>OLSTEIN:  You know what, you have to go in and rescue the mortgages and you  have to take first equity in these mortgages.  That is what you have to do.   Because -</p><p>CAVUTO:  So all people late on their mortgages, you're going to rescue  them?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I'm not going to rescue them, we're going to get the mortgages  and write them down to true market value and have the government be the  first out when these equity -</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well how about those who are paying the mortgages on time, are you  going to rescue them?   So are you going to rescue them?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I'm not writing down mortgages to save the people.  I'm writing  down mortgages to save the system.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  A lot of people get the benefit.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Everyone says let's get the big guys on Wall Street.  Let's kill  Lehman.  So we killed Lehman and he took all the small guys with him.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you hear what you are saying?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I absolutely do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You are saying in order to help shore up their balance sheets,  write down these mortgages to their acceptable value today, right?</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, wait, you know, you're going to benefit those holders of those  mortgages at the time.  So some are going to be benefiting from Bob  Olstein's financial fix and those meanwhile who are paying their mortgages  whose mortgages are not in arrears and whose banks are not calling their  number, they are going will get the bill for the other ones who got stupid.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Who said the government is not going to take the equity in the  homes? Who said that the government is not going to take the equity?</p><p>CAVUTO:  So if someone is going to bail me out and Uncle Sam is going to -</p><p>OLSTEIN: We're not bailing you out or me out.</p><p>CAVUTO:   Fixing their books is bailing out, Bob.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  But let me ask you a question, you want to buy that bad loans.   So who are they bailing out then?</p><p>CAVUTO:  So you say this is a rescue of another name?</p><p>OLSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  That I understand.  OK.  It's a rescue of another name.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  The patient is you got to rescue them or we are going under.   That's is.  I'm telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do see it as a slippery slope here though? </p><p>OLSTEIN:  I don't see it as a slippery slope.  I think they're dealing with  the situation as best they can.  Of course, Neil Cavuto would go in there  and would have saved the entire situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: I would have done nothing.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Well, let me tell you something.  You would not have a job now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, this fear of god is what got everyone - (inaudible) </p><p>OLSTEIN:  Let me ask you a question, how much has been written off already.   This is not the fear of God.  How much money has been put in?</p><p>CAVUTO:  How much has been given and we are still worse off than we were.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  We are worse off than you were.  You are better off than you  would have been.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You are feeding the beast.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I don't care.  I know what the beast is.  It's the problem and  the problem was started 10 and 20 years ago with all these derivatives, and  credit default swaps and getting around the system and Congressman's  saying, everybody has to be in a home.  Everybody should not be in a home.   This is -</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're going to (inaudible) that a lot of people who shouldn't be  in a home are going to be rewarded for being in a home.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  I'm not rewarding them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, you are.  To infinity.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  All right.  What I want to do then is just kick them out and what  happens to the economics.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I would like to kick you out, you're bothering me.  No, seriously,  stick around because I want to bring in the next guest.</p><p>OLSTEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He says President Obama should pull Tim, and says this whole  Geithner obstruction is a waste of time and the president is wasting time  and our time, pushing in.   Peter Flaherty is the president of the national  league on policy center.  You may have heard some of our discussion.  Bob  and I do really love each other deeply.  I have enormous respect for him  but Peter, I want to get your sense of Geithner.  You're saying he's not  worth the trouble?  Get rid of him?</p><p>PETER FLAHERTY, NATIONAL LEAGUE &amp; P0LIDY CENTER PRESIDENT:  Leading the  financial meltdown aside for a moment is nothing more fundamental here.   Timothy Geithner is not qualified ethically to serve in any government  position.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why?  Because of the tax thing? </p><p>FLAHERTY:  Let's take a look at some simple facts here.  He was audited in  2006.  It was found that he did not pay his payroll taxes for the years  2001 through 2004.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know the whole tax thing Peter -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLAHERTY:  So what is fundamental -</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  So that alone disqualifies him?  Bob was saying the tax code  is very complicated.  </p><p>FLAHERTY:  Yes, he paid two years, but then he relied on the statute  of limitation not to pay for the other two years.  And he only paid those  other two years.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  That alone --  </p><p>(CROSS TALK)   </p><p>FLAHERTY:  His assertion that this is unintentional does not pass the  laugh test.  At a certain point, he made a conscious decision not to pay  taxes for the years 2001 and 2002.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  He correct them.  He did pay them.  Bob, that was good enough  for you.  </p><p>OLSSEN:  He made a mistake.  </p><p>FLAHERTY:  It was not a mistake.  It was not a mistake.  It was a  willful tax evasion.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  He tried to say this was a mistake.  I did this, all that.   Do you think, if you put that aside, and I know it's a big thing for you to  put aside, do you think his handling of the financial rescue, being a key  participant in it, should be among the issues that disqualify him?  </p><p>FLAHERTY:  I think it is a serious issue.  He was at Hank Paulson's  side when many of the decisions were made about these various bail outs.   During the campaign, you may remember that John McCain suggested that SEC  Chairman Chris Cox should be fired.  And Obama said, I would fire the whole  bunch.   Well, one of the bunch was Tim Geithner.  </p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>OLSSEN:  I understand your position but I don't think it is practical  right now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Because you say we just need to do this?  </p><p>FLAHERTY:  We need to get on it, now rather than later. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'll give you another reason to fire him, always looking at  his blackberry.  You ever notice, every video shot we have, he is running  around, looking at the blackberry.  I'm just saying, you should be focused  on the financial crisis and not your blackberry.  </p><p>OLSSEN:  Maybe they are wiring him about the financial crisis.  </p><p>FLAHERTY:  What does it say about our new president?  The true test of  character is doing what is right when you don't have the votes, not like  right now when you do have the votes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Peter, why don't you text message that to him.  Let the  secretary to be know that.  Bob, you're never coming on the show because  you are very nasty, but you are also very brilliant.  So you are coming  back.  Barack Obama tipping his hand on how he is going to pay for a lot of  this stimulus.  Much of the general media did not notice.  We did.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  President Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullin, General David  Petraeus in this hour in the white situation room.  The talk is about  drawing down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This on the same day he paved  the way to shut down Gitmo.  A signal that he is about to pare defense  spending and maybe a lot.  </p><p>Let's ask John Robinson, managing editor of \"Defense Daily.\"  What do  you think?  </p><p>JOHN ROBINSON, \"DEFENSE DAILY\":  I don't think so, Neil.  I don't  think for two reasons that he is going to cut defense spending.  One, it is  politically unacceptable for him to come after the Defense Budget during  this time of war.  Two, he has really promised to, at least at worst, keep  the defense budget steady.  As a result of those two things, politically,  and just backing up his promises, it is just not going to happen.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  If you think about, and you start paring the number of active  troop levels by 100,000 or commit to that, that's obviously a lot less  money you have to budget for that.  If you shut down or get the process  going to shut down Gitmo, much of the money is allocated to that begin to  be pared.  A trend here is what I'm saying.  You don't?  </p><p>ROBINSON:  It's sort of a zero sum game to some extent.  A lot of  those forces move to Afghanistan.  It could be other parts of the world.   In his speech, he talked about helping other parts of the world.  Does that  mean we're going to be sending troops to Africa, other places where there  is humanitarian assistance needed?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're not seeing it as a troop draw down as just a  shuffling.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Not at all.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Typically, that's the reaction you get when a Democrat comes  to office, defense stocks come down.  These days, all stocks are going  down.  But -- and because it is bad, because Democrats -- that is an easy  area to cut.  Or that is the rap.  You don't think that is going to be the  case?  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Also, Neil, we're in a recession right now.  If we are  going to cut defense spending, we're going to be throwing defense workers  out of jobs.  And those are union jobs in many of these shops.  It is just  not politically going to be good.  What I think is interesting is that  defense spending really wasn't part of the stimulus package.  They could  have thrown a bunch of goodies in there to build more aircraft, build more  ships.  Really, they didn't do it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  That is a very good point.  John Robinson, \"Defense Daily\"  managing editor.  I want to steal you back.  Very interesting insight on  this.  </p><p>Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard not at all surprised by  the president's Gitmo move to eventually shut it down.  But he did tell me  he is watching the situation carefully.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD:  I would expect the new administration to maintain a very  strong stance against terrorism.  That is what the overwhelming majority of  the American people and America's friends around world want.  It was the  policy of President Obama during the campaign to close down Guantanamo Bay.   I can't imagine, though, that in the process of doing that there won't be  arrangements made to ensure that people charged with terrorist offenses,  crimes against American or other citizens, that those people won't be  brought to justice in some other way.  I would find it unbelievable that  other arrangements wouldn't be made.  </p><p>I imagine, I could be wrong, but I imagine that what is in  contemplation is another arrangement for people to be brought to justice,  perhaps on the American mainland.  Now, it was the policy of the new  president to do this, having been elected.  I now have, being elected on  some explicit commitments, your first instincts are to act to implement  those commitments, whether other people agree with them or not. </p><p>That is his policy.  Having won the ballot, he is entitled to  implement that policy.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Speaking of the new president, it was a bit of a dust-up for  you here in the United States, as well as Australia, when you came  visiting.  You were staying at Blair House.  The president-elect had wanted  to move in early to Blair House, because his two daughters were going to  start school early.  He ended up in hotel.  You were in Blair House.  What  happened?  </p><p>HOWARD:  What happens, as I understand it -- let's face it, I was  invited by the then president as a guest to stay at Blair House.  It was a  gracious invitation.  I accepted it.  The whole thing is an enormous beat- up by sections of the media.  My understanding is, in accordance with  normal custom, there are a whole slew of events being held up at Blair  House up until a week before the inauguration.  Then the new president  moves in.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Everyone tried to blame you.  It was Howard's fault, Howard's  fault.  </p><p>HOWARD:  All I can say is the former president was very gracious and  acting in accordance with normality in inviting me to stay there.  It is a  very great honor to have done so.  And I'm quite sure in the great scheme  of things it wouldn't have been very high on the new president's mind.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And it wasn't.  President Obama, then President-Elect Obama,  didn't make a big deal of it.  He was very gracious, as were you.  Do you  think that President Bush, at the time when he said, no I'm not going to  move the prime minister out of Blair House, when some were saying that he  should have -- the fact that he didn't, what did you think of that?  </p><p>HOWARD:  I don't buy into that.  Look, President Bush was gracious  enough to invite me.  I accepted the invitation.  It would have been almost  rude to have said no.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.  </p><p>HOWARD:  And I obviously was not seeking in any way to offend the new  president.  I don't believe I did.  And I'm just not going to buy into what  was beaten up into something by a section of the American media.  The facts  get in the way of a good story.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  As if you control where you stay.  I guess we could have put  you up at a Best Western, but we chose Blair House.  </p><p>Let me ask you, finally then, your sense of this global respect that  Barack Obama wants in the community, something he says was lost with  President Bush.  How important is that for a leader to be liked by  everybody?  </p><p>HOWARD:  Well, in the long run, any leader will have the impact that  his policies and his performance deserve and deliver.  I think history will  judge President Bush a lot more kindly than many of the commentators at the  present time.  With a new president, particularly President Obama being the  very African-American president in your country's history, that in itself  is a wonderful thing.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>HOWARD:  And people are entitled to feel that way.  But he will start  his term with great goodwill, as all new president do.  Whether that is  retained over a period of time will depend entirely upon how he handles  himself.  And we all want him to succeed, because the leadership of the  United States is important to the rest of the world.  But, in the long run,  he will be judged on his performance, his policies and his record.  </p><p>And that is how the political system works.  But he does have big  challenges.  I think the world has to be very careful in responding to this  economic crisis, that we don't commit future generations to too much  additional debt.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>HOWARD:  It's one thing to bail things out now.  It's another thing to  pay for those debts years into the future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, so if Steve Jobs is hurting, than Apple has really  got to be hurting, right?  News flash.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Shares of Apple rallying in after-hours trading.   The company just blew past many of the most robust earnings estimates.  So  is all of this hammering about Steve Jobs's health overdone?  Let's ask the  Fox Business All-Stars, Jonathan Hoenig, Howard Rosencrans, John Tabacco,  Tracy Byrnes.  </p><p>John Tabacco, to you first.  That is a great report, firing on all  cylinders, iPods, iMacs, everything moving.  </p><p>JOHN TOBACCO, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  You know me.  I'm always with the  evil short sellers.  I've got to say right off the bat, it is not about  Steve Jobs's health at this point.  It's about right now a lot of people  are saying iPhones stink, that the batteries stink.  The screens are  freezing up.  There was a craze of buying.  But looking out on the horizon,  one of the best innovations in the new iPhone is this Google map feature  which everyone loves.  They can hit their Zagats restaurants and everywhere  they need to go.</p><p>But 2010 comes the Google Phone.  And there is no risk --  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think this is short lived.  Enjoy it now?  </p><p>TABACCO:  I think the short sellers are seemingly agreeing today that  Apple is headed down.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Stock was up today, right?  </p><p>TABACCO:  Today is a mere snapshot of what will happen.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Snapshot on your iPhone.  What do you make that, Howard?  </p><p>HOWARD ROSENCRANS, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  I'm not going to bet against  Apple.  The marketing is brilliant.  I haven't heard any of these things  John has heard that had all the negative commentary associated with the  maps.  It is an amazing company.  All that said, you're talking about 10  billion dollars in an individual quarter in an economy that continues to  deteriorate at the high end.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  That was an impressive.  They sold very well in a tough  environment.  </p><p>TABACCO:  Think about how much stimulus money we gave out last year to  buy stuff like iPhones.  Is that going to keep going?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We could have bought other places.  </p><p>TABACCO:  There was great marketing, no doubt.  But you haven't heard  that the iPhones are freezing up and the batteries stink?  You haven't  heard that?  </p><p>ROSENCRANS:  At the margin.  </p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>TABACCO:  I hear a lot of guys switching back.  </p><p>TRACY BYRNES, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  I think what they have done is  genius, because they were selling the Mac.  The Mac was their bread and  butter for a while.  That slowed.  They got the Phone.  Sales were up 88  percent, which is amazing.  Now that the you got the iPhone, you are going  to want to buy a Mac.  People are going to want to integrate the whole  thing.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You see that continuing.    </p><p>BYRNES:  I totally seeing it continuing.  But I don't see this Steve  Jobs health thing going away.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Jonathan Hoenig, back to Steve Jobs and whether  that is going to have a pall over the company?  People are going to start  thinking, you know, he is the guy who makes all this possible, what  happens?  </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX BUSINESS ANALYST:  Neil, the stock has been hurt  and has been hurt very sharply even when people thought Steve Jobs's health  was a lot better.  Even with today's pop up after-hours, up about eight  percent, stock is still near a 52-week low.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is around 90, right?  It's highest was 185, something like  that?  </p><p>HOENIG:  Right.  And basically this is a market performer now.  It is  13 percent of the Nasdaq 100.  Until that next technology that Tracy  alluded to --  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?  </p><p>HOENIG:  It is the major tech stock.  It really is a cult stock, Neil.   Until they get that new technology out there that inspires people to line  up outside the Apple stores all over America, I don't think it is going to  be a place you make any money.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I was way wrong on that Apple quote.  I'm sorry.   The chart was accurate.  I wasn't.  John, at 82 or something, how low does  this thing go then?  </p><p>TABACCO:  Maybe me and Howard should do a double or nothing on our  Lehman bet.  I would say you see 60 before 120.  </p><p>ROSENCRANS:  I'm in your camp, John.  I'm embarrassed because of the  macro picture associated with it.  I don't see them --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you guys find something weird going on here?  Apple has a  good report.  IBM optimistic looking into the next fiscal year.  These are  some big tech heavyweights that are saying, you know, the water is just  fine.  </p><p>ROSENCRANS:  Apple came out and they made commentary on the immediate  quarter.  They don't put it out any further than that.  They're always  providing cautious commentary.  However, they did suggest a fairly powerful  quarter.  </p><p>IBM, on the other hand, when you're talking about 29 billion dollars  in the quarter, that does make a hell of a statement.  It suggests --  because IBM can not be just an IBM story.  It has to be a decent  commentary.  Somehow they are seeing -- </p><p>BYRNES:  If you look at the numbers, Neil, a lot of it was in their  servicing.  What that means is people in IBM's case are keeping their  computers, and having things serviced to make them last longer.  Nobody  wants to go out and buy things.  They keep putting out products, Apple.  I  keep buying them for my kids.  Stock will save up.  </p><p>TABACCO:  So people are servicing their IBMs, but they are going to  run out and buy a Mac because they love their iPhone.  That is contrary.  </p><p>BYRNES:  It is not.  This was the --  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Guys, we have to pay our bills here.  We're not right now.   So mixed messages from the markets to President Obama.  But the president  was pretty clear in what he wanted to tell Wall Street today.  We'll  explain.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Down about 300 points on inauguration day.  Up  about 300 points on his first full in office.  Mixed messages from the  street to its young president.  But a clear message to Wall Street from the  president.  He is freezing salaries of any White House staff making over  100,000 dollars a year.  That is about what Hoenig makes in an hour.  </p><p>So 100,000, is that the new rich?  Jonathan?  </p><p>HOENIG:  Well, for Obama, Neil, that line is kind of changed for quite  a long time, right?  It was 250.  Then it went down to 200.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'll tell you something, Jonathan, when he first started  campaigning a couple years ago, a millionaire was rich.  You earn a million  dollars -- throughout the campaign, it went down and down.  </p><p>HOENIG:  It keeps going lower.  Listen, every company in America,  Neil, is freezing salaries.  So on some level, I'm glad to see him taking  some responsibility for spending in Washington.  What worries me more  though is the control he is likely to exert over private sector about what  they pay their CEOs and their executives,  not to mention the hundreds of  billions of dollars that he's going to be shuffling out the door to all his  pet projects.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think Jonathan hit on a brilliant point.  I think what is  going on here -- you know, they always have the gap between the rich and  the poor, Tracy, I think rather than bring the bottom up, let's whack the  top down?  </p><p>BYRNES:  If you go through even the tax proposals, not one of them,  not anything applies to anybody who makes over 200,000.  And actually, it  is at 150,000 where they start to phase out.  He is not giving anything to  the people at the top.  And as you're saying, we even hear Pelosi saying  she wants to raise taxes on the top.  So yes, he is going to try to bring  us all down into this happy minimum.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now I have a new Machiavellian theory on that.  That was a  trial balloon for the administration to stick it to the rich sooner.  What  do you think, John?    </p><p>TABACCO:  I say let the social engineering begin.  This is the first  in one of many moves that you'll see.  A hundred thousand, that is all you  can make.  Now we can hire a lot more 20, 30, 40 thousand dollar employees.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that the message the government sends, that all of a  sudden you're saying, 100,000 sounds like a lot to us.  Do you think,  Howard, it is telling private sector, if you're cutting, go to that crowd?  </p><p>ROSENCRANS:  Listen, it sending a nice, quote, message.  At end of the  day, though, it is pretty important to want to attract the best people to  work in this profession.  To make a commentary on what people are going to  get paid in the private sector or to it in government, to send the message  that, it is --  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I just found out the other day what other anchors here are  being paid.  Ticks me off royally.  Jonathan Hoenig, I'm looking at that,  and I'm just saying, this could be the opening salvo to social engineering.   Or am I over-dramatizing it?  </p><p>HOENIG:  Neil, it absolutely is.  Now, of course, the government is a  major shareholder throughout the entire financial world, in Citibank, in  Bank of America.  Believe me, the Barney Franks, the Chris Dodds, and yes,  President Obama are going to make a big deal about what those on the top,  even some of those in the middle are making in terms of salary at the end  of the day.  </p><p>BYRNES:  Those guys in D.C. never made a lot of money to begin with.   They all make between 100 and 200 to begin with.  He's not making a --</p><p>CAVUTO:  How long are they going to be frozen?  </p><p>TABACCO:  Who knows?  Probably for a while.  Most government workers I  know get paid, like you said, between 100 and 200.  But they work like 20  hours a day, these guys, already.    </p><p>CAVUTO:  A lot of them do.  </p><p>TABACCO:  You can't make more than 100 grand.  What kind of  opportunity are you creating for these people to work as hard as you're  working now or harder, because we're in tough times.  </p><p>BYRNES:  They're doing it for the good of the people.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think he is sending a message, we're pulling our belts in.  </p><p>TABACCO:  People that should be worried are the guys like Robert  Kennedy.  We need innovation to go green and we don't have the money to get  innovation.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When we come back, he let his mother-in-law move into the  White House, got the Jonas Brothers to perform for his kids in the White  House, and endured two straight hours of watching a parade outside the  White House.  Policy aside, if that isn't devotion, I don't know what is. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Can I ask you something?  Do you like parades?  I got into a  lot of trouble last night when I said I'm not a big fan of them myself.   Nothing personal.  But they just kind of go on and on and on.  I got more  than a few marching band coordinators sick.  One of them e-mailed me to say  \"had he been there, he would have heaved a baton at my skull.\"  Said, \"I  should be more like President and Mrs. Obama.  Not only do they love a  parade, they're among the first few couples, at least that I have ever  seen, never to take their eyes off it.  Never.\"  </p><p>I saw it for myself.  They were just about the last ones standing in  that White House reviewing stand.  I'm not kidding.  Because I was across  the street.  </p><p>Anyway, look at this, when the parade started, all those coveted seats  in the glass enclosed stand were taken, even the cheap seats out in the  freezing cold.  Then only minutes into the parade, they all start  scattering like me at a health food store.  You've got cabinet secretaries  and social secretaries and pretty much all the secretaries, then even the  dude who was serving drinks.  </p><p>Soon even Sasha and Malia were out of there.  The mother-in-law too.   By the parade's wee end, barely a wee soul in that stand, save the cheering  and waving and very happy Barack and Michelle Obama.  </p><p>I didn't once see them take a break or once not acknowledge every  marcher and twirler and flipper and singer and trumpeter, not a one.  Sure,  you could say it was in their honor; they had to stay.  Actually, they  didn't.  They had inaugurals balls to go to, and since everything was  running late, really, really late, this marching madness was cutting into  what was supposed to be two hours of quiet quality time in their new home.  </p><p>No matter.  If the band played on, they stayed on.  As my headache  from all the noise just went on and on.  I kept asking, surely they can't  take two hours of this without a break?  They just smiled and waved, as if  to say, actually, yes, we can.  Republicans be warned, if you think you can  roll these guys, think again.  They have endured more than you going on and  on.  They've endured the ultimate, parades that go on and on, even longer.   And they even looked happy doing it.  </p><p>It's not right.  Good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Trump administration intends to ask academics, government officials and AI developers about ways to adapt regulations to advance AI in such fields as agriculture, health care and transportation, according to a draft schedule of the event. </p><p>And they're set to discuss the U.S. government's power to fund cutting-edge research into such technologies as machine learning. For the White House, the challenge is to strike a balance between the benefits of computers that can spot disease or drive cars and the reality that jobs \u2014 or lives \u2014are at stake in the age of AI. \"Whether you're a farmer in Iowa, an energy producer in Texas [or] a drug manufacturer in Boston, you are going to be using these techniques to drive your business going forward,\" Michael Kratsios, deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said. Among those expected to be in the room for that private gathering Thursday will be representatives from tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia and Oracle, as well as other businesses like Ford, Land O'Lakes, Mastercard, Pfizer and United Airlines, according to the White House. Slated to represent Facebook is Jerome Pesenti, its vice president of AI, the company confirmed. Amazon plans to send Rohit Prasad, the head scientist for its voice-assistant Alexa. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich is also expected to attend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press George Mathew, chief executive of

which has been outlined in a submission yet to be made public by the US Trade Representative to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - is understood to note the implications of the law.</p><p>However, it doesn't suggest anything other than the issue needs more time to be considered, The Australian Financial Review has learned.</p><p>There has also been no direct lobbying of the Australian government by the US government on the draft code.</p><p>The US government's stance highlights the fast-moving and often-conflicting set of interests at play as the Silicon Valley's tech giants face off against a growing array of anti-trust moves, growing congressional scrutiny, and a US President less than two months out from an election and who is both one of their largest and most critical users.</p><p>In Australia, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/topic/facebook-5wz\">Facebook dramatically escalated tensions</url> over the law last week by threatening to stop publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on their platforms should the code become law.</p><p>Australia's competition watchdog argues the law is needed to resolve a \"fundamental imbalance\" in bargaining power between the tech titans and traditional news companies - including Nine, publisher of The Financial Review.</p><p>The law would force news companies to negotiate payment with Google and Facebook within a three-month period, after which the issue would go to forced arbitration to set a price.</p><p>Google's Australian head of government relations Lucinda Longcroft, told The Financial Times last week that Washington holds concerns about the code.</p><p>\"We understand that the US government is concerned about the way in which this initiative, the draft code is framed - targeted seemingly in a discriminatory way against two companies which are American.\"</p><p>Both companies have been lobbying hard in Canberra, with Google's global boss Sundar Pichai holding a video conference call with Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</p><p>Facebook has also spoken to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who has vowed the government will not be swayed by \"coercion or heavy-handed tactics\".</p><p>\"Our reforms to digital platforms are world leading and follow a ground-breaking 18-month inquiry by the ACCC.\"</p><p>While some in the US have dismissed the Australian move as a sideshow, there is a fear that if the code becomes law it will embolden other, much larger, jurisdictions to follow suit, particularly across Europe.</p><p>At the same time, there are signs of a tougher regulatory approach in the US.</p><p>Attorney General William Barr - who has repeatedly held close discussions with Australian ministers including Peter Dutton over the past year - plans to bring an antitrust case against Alphabet, Google's parent company, as soon as this month, according to a New York Times report on Thursday (Friday AEST).</p><p>At the same time, Australia's competition regulator signed last week an international cooperation agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission and three other countries to better target global players including big tech.</p><p>While the agreement between regulators in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK has been in the pipeline for some time, it's creation has been driven by recognition that the digital tech space is increasingly cross-border.</p><p>The agreement sets out how regulators share information, the steps that are required to determine the scope of inquiries and how to deal with issues such as commercial-in-confidence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520322875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SY-T7G1-JBJ7-N3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><timeReceived>02:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In a May 16 tweet, the president accused several popular platforms of serving the \"radical left and hinted at a White House-led remedy.</p><p>\"The Radical Left is in total command &amp; control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google, Trump wrote in the tweet, adding that the administration is \"working to remedy this illegal situation.</p><p>Social media and big tech companies have repeatedly denied claims of politically motivated discrimination.</p><p>Conservatives have long argued that big tech and social media platforms suppress right-leaning voices through politically motivated content moderation, selective fact-checking, skewing search rankings, and manipulating news feeds.</p><p>Radio talk show ho st D ennis Prager several years ago sued Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google and YouTube, claiming that YouTube's \"animus toward his \"political identity and viewpoint led it to curb access to videos, including through its \"Restricted Mode setting, on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam, and terrorism, despite its stated promise of</p><p>neutrality. Alphabet later won the dismissal of the lawsuit, with the judge saying Google and YouTube didn't qualify as \"state actors subject to the First Amendment by creating a \"public forum for</p><p>speech. \"Defendants are private entities who created their own video-sharing social media website and make decisions about whether and how to regulate content that has been uploaded on that website, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh</p><p>wrote. \"Plaintiff has not shown that defendants have engaged in one of the very few public functions that were traditionally exclusively reserved to the state, she</p><p>added. Steps to ramp up content moderation taken by social media companies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic have done little to allay conservative concerns. In March, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai published an announcement noting that YouTube, which is owned by Google, had removed thousands of COVID-19 videos its content moderation tools and staff deemed</p><p>\"misleading. \"On YouTube, we've taken down thousands of videos related to dangerous or misleading coronavirus information, and we continue to remove videos that promote medically unproven methods to prevent coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, Pichai</p><p>wrote. But many conservatives hold that the standards for determining what is \"misleading are insufficiently transparent and prone to politically-motivated</p><p>tilt. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced a policy on April 22 that \"anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy, and that it would be \"removing information that is</p><p>problematic. The regime in China was recently accused by Trump's national security adviser of intentionally giving \"false information to the World Health Organization, and the president has warned of permanent cuts to the agency's</p><p>funding. Mark Grabowski, an associate professor specializing in cyber law and digital ethics at Adelphi University, told The Epoch Times there's a double standard when it comes to online speech, in particular with COVID-19 related</p><p>topics. \"In some cases, the [virus] content was produced by authoritative sources like physicians, professors, and epidemiologists, he said. \"Meanwhile, these same platforms are promoting highly speculative opinions by people who are completely unqualified to speak on the</p><p>topic. At last year's White House-hosted social media summit, conservative critics denounced a range of alleged practices by big tech companies, with Trump weighing in with allegations of unfair</p><p>treatment. \"We have terrible bias. We have censorship like no one has any understanding, nobody can believe, Trump said at the event. \"They're playing with a lot of minds and they're playing</p><p>unfairly. Matthew Feeney, director of the Project on Emerging Technologies at Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argued in a recent op-ed that while the content-moderation policies of social media companies might anger some, imposing excessive restrictions would</p><p>be counterproductive. \"Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and many others made the prudent business decision not to use the First Amendment as</p><p>their contentSmoderation guideline, Feeney wrote. \"With billions of people using these companies' products, it shouldn't be surprising that their contentSmoderation policies will sometimes irritate and anger some of their users, he continued, adding, \"But such irritation should not prompt proposals that are contrary to the principles of free speech and risk destroying the Internet of today that-while far from perfect-remains the best</p><p>venue for speech in history.

Alphabet later won the dismissal of the lawsuit, with the judge saying Google and YouTube didn't qualify as \"state actors subject to the First Amendment by creating a \"public forum for</p><p>speech. \"Defendants are private entities who created their own video-sharing social media website and make decisions about whether and how to regulate content that has been uploaded on that website, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh</p><p>wrote. \"Plaintiff has not shown that defendants have engaged in one of the very few public functions that were traditionally exclusively reserved to the state, she</p><p>added. Steps to ramp up content moderation taken by social media companies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic have done little to allay conservative concerns. In March, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai published an announcement noting that YouTube, which is owned by Google, had removed thousands of COVID-19 videos its content moderation tools and staff deemed</p><p>\"misleading. \"On YouTube, we've taken down thousands of videos related to dangerous or misleading coronavirus information, and we continue to remove videos that promote medically unproven methods to prevent coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, Pichai</p><p>wrote. But many conservatives hold that the standards for determining what is \"misleading are insufficiently transparent and prone to politically-motivated</p><p>tilt. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced a policy on April 22 that \"anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy, and that it would be \"removing information that is</p><p>problematic. The regime in China was recently accused by Trump's national security adviser of intentionally giving \"false information to the World Health Organization, and the president has warned of permanent cuts to the agency's</p><p>funding. Mark Grabowski, an associate professor specializing in cyber law and digital ethics at Adelphi University, told The Epoch Times there's a double standard when it comes to online speech, in particular with COVID-19 related</p><p>topics. \"In some cases, the [virus] content was produced by authoritative sources like physicians, professors, and epidemiologists, he said. \"Meanwhile, these same platforms are promoting highly speculative opinions by people who are completely unqualified to speak on the</p><p>topic. At last year's White House-hosted social media summit, conservative critics denounced a range of alleged practices by big tech companies, with Trump weighing in with allegations of unfair</p><p>treatment. \"We have terrible bias. We have censorship like no one has any understanding, nobody can believe, Trump said at the event. \"They're playing with a lot of minds and they're playing</p><p>unfairly. Matthew Feeney, director of the Project on Emerging Technologies at Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argued in a recent op-ed that while the content-moderation policies of social media companies might anger some, imposing excessive restrictions would</p><p>be counterproductive. \"Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and many others made the prudent business decision not to use the First Amendment as</p><p>their contentSmoderation guideline, Feeney wrote. \"With billions of people using these companies' products, it shouldn't be surprising that their contentSmoderation policies will sometimes irritate and anger some of their users, he continued, adding, \"But such irritation should not prompt proposals that are contrary to the principles of free speech and risk destroying the Internet of today that-while far from perfect-remains the best</p><p>venue for speech in history.

Peterson Foundation, underscore the challenges facing the president as he seeks re-election and the uphill battle for Democrats in winning back the votes of white men who helped propel Trump's 2016 victory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent caucuses in Iowa pointed to the importance Democrats have placed on peeling working-class whites from the president's column. Pete Buttigieg, who remains in the lead in the slowly arriving Iowa results, was propelled in part by winning in counties that had voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Trump in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obama won Iowa, a swing state where 90 per cent of voters are white, in the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections, but Trump triumphed there in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points. Buttigieg pointed to his strong showing as evidence he could bring voters \"back into the fold\" and win a general election in November.</p><p>Opinion: Democrats want Americans to kick Trump out, but there's one problem: the thriving economy( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/democrats-want-americans-to-kick-trump-out-but-theres-one-problem-the-thriving-economy\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/democrats-want-americans-to-kick-trump-out-but-theres-one-problem-the-thriving-economy</url> )</p><p>Fact Check: Trump myths on economy; Democrats' selective facts( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/ap-fact-check-trump-myths-on-economy-dems-selective-facts\">https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/ap-fact-check-trump-myths-on-economy-dems-selective-facts</url> )</p><p>Yes, Trump can win re-election. But he should be very worried about his ratings and the economy( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/yes-trump-can-win-re-election-but-he-should-be-very-worried-about-his-ratings-and-the-economy\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/yes-trump-can-win-re-election-but-he-should-be-very-worried-about-his-ratings-and-the-economy</url> )</p><p>Trump has made his economic record central to his case for re-election, and used his State of the Union address on Tuesday to claim \"incredible results\" in the U.S. economy.</p><p>Last month, the president insisted that nearly all Americans have benefited from the country's longest stretch of economic expansion, which began early in Obama's presidency, and has continued for more than a decade.</p><p>\"Are you better off now than you were three years ago?\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Almost everyone say YES!\"</p><p>But the latest FT-Peterson Economic Monitor showed that among likely voters, white men are the only group with close to a majority who believe they are better off. Forty-eight per cent said they were either \"much better off\" or \"somewhat better off\" since Trump took office.</p><p>All other groups are significantly more dissatisfied - including white women, illustrating Trump's persistent gap with female voters. Only 33 per cent of white women believe they are better off financially now than they were in 2016.</p><p>Joann Boldt of Des Moines, Iowa, a retired United Airlines flight attendant who voted for Trump in 2016, is typical of the kind of voters Democrats are targeting. She volunteered for Amy Klobuchar, a moderate senator from Minnesota, in Monday's caucuses, and said she would vote for a Democrat for the first time in November's presidential election.</p><p>\"I will always be a Republican at heart. But when Trump separated the parents from their children, he lost me there,\" said Boldt, in a reference to the president's immigration policies at the US-Mexico border.</p><p>African-Americans and Hispanics are far more likely to say their financial situation has become worse under Trump than white voters. Forty-eight per cent of black men believe they are worse off since Trump took office, with 33 per cent saying they are \"much worse off\", while 45 per cent of African-American women say their finances have deteriorated.</p><p>Similarly, 49 per cent of Hispanic women say they are worse off - the most dissatisfied demographic group in the FT-Peterson survey - while 42 per cent of Hispanic men said they were worse off.</p><p>The findings are part of the monthly FT-Peterson U.S. Economic Monitor, which tracks voter sentiment towards the U.S. economy in the run-up to November's presidential election. The survey focuses on whether likely voters feel better or worse off financially since Trump became president. Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 by asking voters: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p><p>Are you better off now than you were three years ago? Almost everyone say YES!</p><p>- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2020( <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1222184371932798976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1222184371932798976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> )</p><p>Overall, dissatisfaction with personal finances has remained constant since the FT-Peterson poll began tracking voter sentiment last October. The latest survey shows two-thirds of likely voters believe their finances have not improved since Trump took office, a figure that has remained largely unchanged over the past four months despite a 7 per cent rally in the S&amp;;P 500 and 2.1 per cent economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - of Americans said Trump's policies had helped the economy, while 39 per cent said they had hurt. A further 10 per cent said they had no impact.</p><p>The most recent FT-Peterson poll was conducted online by Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling company, and North Star Opinion Research, a Republican group, between January 21 and January 26. It reflects the opinions of 1,004 likely voters nationwide, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p><p>The Peterson Foundation is a non-partisan, non-profit organization focused on America's fiscal challenges.</p><p>The vast majority of Americans say technology companies are \"mostly good\" for the U.S. economy, casting doubt on whether Democrats' calls to crack down on \"Big Tech\" will win over voters in November's U.S. presidential election.</p><p>The latest FT-Peterson poll found 90 per cent of respondents said technology companies are \"mostly good\" for the U.S. economy, compared with 10 per cent who said they were \"mostly bad\".</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - of Americans said Trump's policies had helped the economy, while 39 per cent said they had hurt, a new poll suggests.</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - said tech companies should be \"much more\" or \"somewhat more\" regulated by the federal government, while 39 per cent said tech groups should be regulated \"about the same as they are now\". The remaining 10 per cent said they should be less regulated.</p><p>Democrats were more likely than Republicans to back tougher regulation, with 60 per cent of Democrats saying more regulation was needed, compared with only 41 per cent of Republicans.</p><p>The findings raise questions about whether Democrats' calls for aggressive action against multinational technology groups will win support - either in the current primary process, or in the general election against Trump. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been among the most vocal critics of \"Big Tech\" among Democratic contenders, calling for the break-up of major companies, including Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Warren finished third in the delegate count in Monday's Iowa caucuses, based on official results from most precincts.</p><p>Trump has not called for the break-up of Big Tech, but has attacked social media companies, claiming they are biased against Republicans, and Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.</p><p>The president has suggested \"there is something going on in terms of monopoly\", and last year the U.S. Department of Justice announced an antitrust review of \"market-leading online platforms\".</p><p>While the FT-Peterson poll found that barely half of Americans favoured more regulation for technology companies, the overwhelming majority - 87 per cent - said they were concerned about technology companies' handling of their personal data.</p><p>The U.S. lacks national data protection legislation akin to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, but new rules that came into effect in California last month are likely to set the standard for privacy across America. The legislation gives consumers in California the right to see all the personal information a business holds about them and ask for that data to be deleted or not sold to third parties. The rules apply to any company with at least $25m in annual gross revenues that does business in California, or collects and processes data on the state's residents. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The latest survey shows two-thirds of likely voters believe their finances have not improved since Trump took office, a figure that has remained largely unchanged over the past four months despite a 7 per cent rally in the S&amp;;P 500 and 2.1 per cent economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - of Americans said Trump's policies had helped the economy, while 39 per cent said they had hurt. A further 10 per cent said they had no impact.</p><p>The most recent FT-Peterson poll was conducted online by Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling company, and North Star Opinion Research, a Republican group, between January 21 and January 26. It reflects the opinions of 1,004 likely voters nationwide, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p><p>The Peterson Foundation is a non-partisan, non-profit organization focused on America's fiscal challenges.</p><p>The vast majority of Americans say technology companies are \"mostly good\" for the U.S. economy, casting doubt on whether Democrats' calls to crack down on \"Big Tech\" will win over voters in November's U.S. presidential election.</p><p>The latest FT-Peterson poll found 90 per cent of respondents said technology companies are \"mostly good\" for the U.S. economy, compared with 10 per cent who said they were \"mostly bad\".</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - of Americans said Trump's policies had helped the economy, while 39 per cent said they had hurt, a new poll suggests.</p><p>Just over half - 51 per cent - said tech companies should be \"much more\" or \"somewhat more\" regulated by the federal government, while 39 per cent said tech groups should be regulated \"about the same as they are now\". The remaining 10 per cent said they should be less regulated.</p><p>Democrats were more likely than Republicans to back tougher regulation, with 60 per cent of Democrats saying more regulation was needed, compared with only 41 per cent of Republicans.</p><p>The findings raise questions about whether Democrats' calls for aggressive action against multinational technology groups will win support - either in the current primary process, or in the general election against Trump. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been among the most vocal critics of \"Big Tech\" among Democratic contenders, calling for the break-up of major companies, including Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Warren finished third in the delegate count in Monday's Iowa caucuses, based on official results from most precincts.</p><p>Trump has not called for the break-up of Big Tech, but has attacked social media companies, claiming they are biased against Republicans, and Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.</p><p>The president has suggested \"there is something going on in terms of monopoly\", and last year the U.S. Department of Justice announced an antitrust review of \"market-leading online platforms\".</p><p>While the FT-Peterson poll found that barely half of Americans favoured more regulation for technology companies, the overwhelming majority - 87 per cent - said they were concerned about technology companies' handling of their personal data.</p><p>The U.S. lacks national data protection legislation akin to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, but new rules that came into effect in California last month are likely to set the standard for privacy across America. The legislation gives consumers in California the right to see all the personal information a business holds about them and ask for that data to be deleted or not sold to third parties. The rules apply to any company with at least $25m in annual gross revenues that does business in California, or collects and processes data on the state's residents. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Ms Warren finished third in the delegate count in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, based on official results from most precincts.</p><p>Mr Trump has not called for the break-up of Big Tech, but has attacked social media companies, claiming they are biased against Republicans, and Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post. </p><p>The president has suggested \u201cthere is something going on in terms of monopoly\u201d, and last year the US Department of Justice announced an antitrust review of \u201cmarket-leading online platforms\u201d.</p><p>While the FT-Peterson poll found that barely half of Americans favoured more regulation for technology companies, the overwhelming majority \u2014 87 per cent \u2014 said they were concerned about technology companies\u2019 handling of their personal data.</p><p>The US lacks national data protection legislation akin to the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, but new rules that came into effect in California last month are likely to set the standard for privacy across America. The legislation gives consumers in California the right to see all the personal information a business holds about them and ask for that data to be deleted or not sold to third parties. The rules apply to any company with at least $25m in annual gross revenues that does business in California, or collects and processes data on the state\u2019s residents. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lauren Fedor </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-c5bdccda42f611eaa43ac4b328d9061c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y50-CSF1-JB77-K20N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy\u2019s garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who\u2019ve espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the candidates\u2019 furthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p> Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters \u2014 both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p> The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Face</p><p> book group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p> The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist \u2014 a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p> \u201cWhite supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\u201d said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \u201cThe tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope \u2014 we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\u201d</p><p> And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by minorities or foreigners.</p><p> Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p> Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 a provision that\u2019s been called \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d</p><p> O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don\u2019t set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p> \u201cThis is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p> Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it\u2019s questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p> Kosseff said it\u2019s a legal issue that hasn\u2019t been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O\u2019Rourke is proposing.</p><p> \u201cThere are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\u201d such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \u201cBut hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\u201d</p><p> Hate speech that isn\u2019t an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \u201cA law can\u2019t just ban it. And Congress can\u2019t just tell platforms to ban it, either \u2014 that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\u201d she said.</p><p> Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p> But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they\u2019re banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p> \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cThe types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\u201d</p><p> The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p> To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \u201cwithin the boundaries of internet companies\u2019 terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s plan states.</p><p> He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI\u2019s domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p> \u201cAs an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\u201d Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p> Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p> Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She\u2019d also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \u201ca suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\u201d</p><p> And O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p> The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven\u2019t released specific plans on the issue.</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TORDLY-4423958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897A487996360 TORDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0S-CXV1-JBCN-43SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy\u2019s garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who\u2019ve espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the candidates\u2019 furthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p> Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters \u2014 both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p> The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, West Virginia, in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Facebook group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p>   The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist \u2014 a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p> \u201cWhite supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\u201d said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \u201cThe tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope \u2014 we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\u201d</p><p> And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by minorities or foreigners.</p><p> Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p> Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 a provision that\u2019s been called \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don\u2019t set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p> \u201cThis is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p> Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it\u2019s questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p> Kosseff said it\u2019s a legal issue that hasn\u2019t been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O\u2019Rourke is proposing.</p><p> \u201cThere are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\u201d such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \u201cBut hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\u201d</p><p> Hate speech that isn\u2019t an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \u201cA law can\u2019t just ban it. And Congress can\u2019t just tell platforms to ban it, either \u2014 that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\u201d she said.</p><p> Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p> But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they\u2019re banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cThe types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\u201d</p><p> The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p> To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \u201cwithin the boundaries of internet companies\u2019 terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s plan states.</p><p> He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI\u2019s domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p> \u201cAs an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\u201d Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p> Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p> Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She\u2019d also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \u201ca suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\u201d</p><p> And O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p> The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven\u2019t released specific plans on the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OCREG-4425166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABAD8E6370FD OCREG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-V8C1-JBCN-42T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Orange County Register All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Orange County Register (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy\u2019s garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who\u2019ve espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the candidates\u2019 furthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p> Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters \u2014 both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p> The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, West Virginia, in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Facebook group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p> The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the</p><p>Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist \u2014 a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p> \u201cWhite supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\u201d said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \u201cThe tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope \u2014 we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\u201d</p><p> And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by minorities or foreigners.</p><p> Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p> Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 a provision that\u2019s been called \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d</p><p> O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don\u2019t set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p> \u201cThis is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p> Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it\u2019s questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p> Kosseff said it\u2019s a legal issue that hasn\u2019t been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O\u2019Rourke is proposing.</p><p> \u201cThere are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\u201d such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \u201cBut hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\u201d</p><p> Hate speech that isn\u2019t an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \u201cA law can\u2019t just ban it. And Congress can\u2019t just tell platforms to ban it, either \u2014 that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\u201d she said.</p><p> Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p> But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they\u2019re banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p> \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cThe types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\u201d</p><p> The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p> To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \u201cwithin the boundaries of internet companies\u2019 terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s plan states.</p><p> He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI\u2019s domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p> \u201cAs an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\u201d Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p> Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p> Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She\u2019d also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \u201ca suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\u201d</p><p> And O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p> The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven\u2019t released specific plans on the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSENT-4425177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABCBCF9B2DC6 PRSENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-1DF1-JBCN-451X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Press Enterprise, Inc.

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy\u2019s garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who\u2019ve espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the candidates\u2019 furthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p> Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters \u2014 both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p> The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, West Virginia, in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Facebook group chats, as well as on the</p><p> chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p> The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist \u2014 a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p> \u201cWhite supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\u201d said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \u201cThe tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope \u2014 we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\u201d</p><p> And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \u201creplaced\u201d by minorities or foreigners.</p><p> Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p> Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 a provision that\u2019s been called \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d</p><p> O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don\u2019t set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p> \u201cThis is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p> Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it\u2019s questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p> Kosseff said it\u2019s a legal issue that hasn\u2019t been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O\u2019Rourke is proposing.</p><p> \u201cThere are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\u201d such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \u201cBut hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\u201d</p><p> Hate speech that isn\u2019t an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \u201cA law can\u2019t just ban it. And Congress can\u2019t just tell platforms to ban it, either \u2014 that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\u201d she said.</p><p> Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p> But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they\u2019re banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p> \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cThe types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\u201d</p><p> The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p> To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \u201cwithin the boundaries of internet companies\u2019 terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s plan states.</p><p> He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI\u2019s domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p> \u201cAs an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\u201d Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p> Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p> Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She\u2019d also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \u201ca suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\u201d</p><p> And O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p> The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven\u2019t released specific plans on the issue.</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAD-4424247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB72645A7AC LAD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0S-CXV1-JBCN-440N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157105</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Digital First Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily News of Los Angeles</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I think it s an exciting new growth area, and like many exciting new growth areas, there are some hot IPOs. I have never bought an IPO in my life. I think we are in an IPO bubble,  Tilson said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Learn from Whitney Tilson and other traders in person at the Benzinga Global Trading &amp; Investing Summit June 20 in New York City!</emphasis></p><h>Where Are The Profits?</h><p>He said today s environment isn t as crazy as the dot-com IPO bubble in the late 1990s, but roughly 90 percent of the recent IPOs aren t profitable companies.</p><p> That s a pretty good barometer for how overheated the IPO market is and how badly investors are likely to get incinerated. Ninety percent is pretty close to the all-time historical high back in 1999. So my general advice to most people is you re the last sucker coming into the poker table in any of these recent IPOs now, so avoid it like the plague,  Tilson said.</p><p>Tilson said it s easy to cherry-pick success stories from the dot-com era like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet, Inc.</emphasis> (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com, Inc.</emphasis> (NASDAQ: AMZN), but it s also easy to forget about recent IPO debacles like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blue Apron Holdings Inc</emphasis> (NASDAQ: APRN) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GoPro Inc</emphasis> (NASDAQ: GPRO).</p><p> Mathematically speaking, they ve done studies and it s the single worst place to invest. There is no surer way to lose money in any strategy than buying hot IPOs,  he said.</p><h>Better Alternatives</h><p>Instead of chasing the hottest tech IPOs, Tilson is bullish on big tech companies Amazon, Alphabet and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook, Inc.</emphasis> (NASDAQ: FB) despite regulatory and political pressures.</p><p> I think it s important to distinguish between business headwinds and headline headwinds. The headlines are real about government investigations and regulatory scrutiny, which by the way I think is healthy for these companies,  he said.</p><p> Over a multi-year period, I believe these stocks will follow their earnings trajectory, and the businesses are actually booming. </p><p>Listen to Tilson's full interview in the video below:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Links:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tilson Vs.

Here is Andrew Left's report this morning: Citron reverses opinion on Tesla[3]. Excerpt:  Get The Full Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q3 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/09/tlry-stock-ticker/whitney-tilson-family223/\">https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/09/tlry-stock-ticker/whitney-tilson-family223/</url> As much as you can't believe you're reading this, we can't believe we're writing this! The most challenging part of being a short seller is to constantly check your thesis to make sure nothing has changed. You must let all predispositions and prejudices disappear and stay focused on only the facts. It is in that spirit and with a great deal of analysis and due diligence that we can say for the first time, Citron is long Tesla as the Model 3 is a proven hit and many of the TSLA warning signs have proven not to be significant. It has been almost 5 years since Citron published the following line: 'By the time this product is even approaching market, there will be multiple other 200-mile range plug-ins that have been out for years.' Rumors of the Tesla killers have been as constant and unfounded as Bob Lutz's call for Tesla's bankruptcy. While the media has been focused on Elon Musk's eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being DOMINATED by Tesla. What has changed?? Here is Anton Wahlman's response just out: Why Citron Is Wrong on Tesla[5]. Excerpt: Andrew Left's 'fundamental' reasoning behind suddenly going from hating TSLA to liking the stock is simply uninformed. Tesla has proven one thing: It is possible to sell a dollar for 80 cents. Bravo! But is that sustainable? In short, Citron's research piece did not show an understanding of Tesla's current, international, and emerging 2019 competitive landscape -- let alone what is coming in 2020, 2021 and 2022. As an investor, you should take a ride down to your local Jaguar dealer and take a look at the i-Pace all-electric SUV and ask yourself: Very soon, every automaker will have more than a handful of these all-electric crossovers. Why would anyone buy a Tesla at that point? I predict that as little as 90 or 180 days from now, Citron's research piece will look very naive in hindsight, at least as far as automotive industry fundamentals are concerned. In the meantime, the stock is up 10% Tuesday. I've invited both Left and Walhman to speak at the Kase Learning Shorting Conference[6], which will take place in NYC on December 3. Left is trying to make the scheduling work (he's based in California) and Wahlman just confirmed - he's planning to give a presentation on Tesla entitled The eight-dimensional analysis of the most complex investment situation. For more information on the conference and to register[7], either in person or livestream, please click here[8]. Don't delay, as the base price jumps from $2,495 to $2,995 at the end of the month - and if you act before then, you can save 10%, by using discount code VW10. I hope to see you then! 2) A very insightful article on the crypto and cannabis bubbles: Crypto and Cannabis Are the Perfect Post-Crisis Bubbles[9]. Excerpt: So here you have these two bubbles, with a lot in common, coming back to back. But why now? If there were an easy explanation for why bubbles emerge, anyone could get rich. But there are some general rules. You need a fantastic story, which both crypto and cannabis have. One's disrupting finance and big tech; the other's a gigantic new market rapidly becoming legal around the world. You also need the supply of investable assets to be small, so there's a huge mismatch between the great story and what investors can actually buy. Both crypto and cannabis have the same meta-story about getting back at corrupt elites. Stick it to big businessmen, with their war on hemp. Stick it to ineffective mainstream medicine. Stick it to central bankers degrading the value of your dollars. Stick it to bankers and their bailouts at taxpayer expense. Stick it to the censors. Stick it to Richard Nixon. Stick it to Jeff Sessions. Stick it to the racist prison-industrial complex. And the cherry on top with both, the believers will tell you, is that thanks to the current regulatory black hole, there's a beautiful opportunity to get in now and make Wall Street the last bag holder. Psychologically, at least, crypto and cannabis[10] are the perfect trades for the post-crisis era. While these are obvious stock bubbles, I think both of these areas are real, so when the bubbles finish bursting (with the current silly stocks down at least 90% -- some will be down 99% - from their peaks), there will no doubt be incredible opportunities for savvy bottom-fishers. For example, consider Priceline.com (now Booking Holdings, BKNG): this darling of the internet bubble saw its stock rise to over $1,000 before it collapsed by more than 99% to under $10. But the company cut its burn rate and survived, with the stock trickling upward for a couple of years. Then it bought Booking.com in July 2005 for $135 million - one of the great acquisitions of all time - and the stock is up nearly 100x since then. 3) For you Charlie Munger junkies (like me), check out this new 24-minute interview[11] (audio only, but posted on YouTube) in which he discusses China (Li Lu appears briefly as well). 4) Here's another good audio (podcast): Eric Schleien ...rcelo Lima talk about Amazon[12] (39 minutes).

It was my 22nd consecutive Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.  Get The Full Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF. </p><p>Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[2] Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger[3] were in fine form, displaying their razor-sharp minds as they answered dozens of questions from the panel of analysts and journalists as well as the audience. It's remarkable to see these wise old men, at 88 and 95, getting better with age! This won't always be the case, of course, and it's something I monitor closely. I've long said that the greatest risk to Berkshire isn't that Buffett gets hit by the proverbial bus. Not to be morbid, but most people don't die suddenly - rather, they slowly fade away, both physically and mentally. Berkshire's value could be seriously impaired if Buffett starts to lose it mentally and makes one or more large, ill-advised investments. It's certainly possible that Buffett might not recognize his own mental decline (or refuse to acknowledge it because he loves his work so much) and the board fails to act, perhaps rationalizing that a diminished Buffett is still better than anyone else. Buffett is aware of this risk and has instructed Berkshire[4]'s board members, both publicly and privately, that their most important job is to \"take away the keys\" if they see him losing it. I trust that both Buffett and the board will act rationally, but also view it as my job to independently observe and evaluate him to make sure I'm comfortable that he's still at the top of his game. The good news is, based on what I saw this weekend, he's never been better. 2) I'm often asked why I keep coming to the annual meetings, especially since I freely acknowledge that nothing really changes: It's pretty much the same people asking the same questions and getting the same answers! In part, it's because I have a lot of fun catching up with old friends and making new ones. Plus, even after more than two decades studying Buffett and Munger intensively, I find that I still keep learning from them. In the early days of my career, I was so inexperienced - and they were such brilliant, inspiring, and patient teachers! Had I not absorbed all of the investing lessons they imparted, I never would have achieved anything close to the success I did. I've come to realize, though, that the most important things I've learned (and continue to learn) from these wise men go beyond investing into what Munger calls \"worldly wisdom[5],\" which is the key to succeeding in the larger game of life. At its core, this wisdom is rooted in some simple concepts: become a lifelong learner, develop good habits, be nice to everyone, marry the right person and keep that relationship strong, avoid calamities, etc. But, like investing, while these concepts are simple in concept, they can be difficult in practice. So it's always good to hear Buffett and Munger's wisdom every year. 3) Here are some of my pictures from the weekend: <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Berkshire-Hathaway-meeting-1.jpg\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Berkshire-Hathaway-meeting-1.jpg</url> In them are screenshots of my interview with Yahoo Finance at the lunch break of the meeting... me hanging out with various friends and family, including my uncle, cousin, and his wife... Chris Stavrou[6], who was attending his 34th consecutive meeting (he first bought Berkshire in the 1970s at $211 and his average cost on the shares he owns today is $1,780)... Guy Spier... Lloyd Khaner... and my analysts Steve Culbertson and Kevin DeCamp. Two of the pictures are from the \"Invest in Yourself\" 5K race on Sunday morning, which was great fun. There were 3,150 official runners (and a lot of unofficial ones). I finished in 23:33 (a 7:35-per-mile pace), good enough for 151st overall (top 5%) and 10th of 164 men in my age group (50-54). 4) My one disappointment from the weekend was that I didn't get to ask a question. I've asked a dozen over the past two decades - more than anyone - and being a competitive guy, I was looking forward to adding to my lead! There's a lottery at each microphone, so you have to get lucky and be one of the first two names picked. Twelve of us were waiting at microphone 11 in the overflow room, so my odds weren't good. But to my delight, I was No. 2, so I prepared this question, to which I was eager to hear Buffett and Munger's thoughts: My question is about self-driving cars. Last week Tesla announced that, within a year, its cars will have full Level 5 self-driving capabilities - meaning a steering wheel would be superfluous. It also announced that, pending regulatory approval, it will have a fleet of a million robotaxis by the end of next year. This timeline is years more aggressive than that of any other carmaker. Do you have an opinion on how quickly any automaker will be able to offer truly autonomous driving, meaning you'll be able to get in your car in Omaha and drive to LA or New York without touching the wheel even once? And regardless of the timeline, what are your thoughts on how this will affect two major Berkshire holdings: First, could self-driving trucks reduce the huge cost advantage railroads have over trucks? And second, if autonomous cars get in far fewer accidents, could this hurt GEICO[7]'s business? For whatever reason, however, Buffett and Munger were moving more slowly through the questions this year. They took the question from microphone 10 at 3:25 p.m., so it looked like I was going to be the last question before the meeting ended at 3:30. But then they gave a super-long answer and ended the meeting. ARRRRHHHHHH!!! 5) Over the weekend, Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings (here are links to the press release[8] and 10-Q[9]). Overall, the company continues to hum along. A few quick thoughts: You can ignore the huge headline profits of $21.7 billion, as most of that was due to gains in the stock portfolio, reversing most of the fourth-quarter losses. Over time, the performance of Berkshire's stock portfolio is an important driver of value, but quarter-to-quarter swings are meaningless. Operating income was only up 5% in the first quarter. But this didn't include Kraft Heinz (KHC), which hasn't filed its annual 10-K or first-quarter earnings due to accounting issues. In the first quarter of 2018, Berkshire's earnings from KHC were $265 million. KHC has been struggling, but even if you add only $200 million for last quarter, Berkshire's operating earnings would have been up 9% year-over-year. Float was up a healthy 7% year-over-year. Share repurchases were only $1.6 billion - a bit disappointing, but Munger said they'll be \"more liberal\" in the future, and Buffett said he'd love to buy back a ton of stock if it was 25%-30% undervalued. Berkshire is roughly 10% undervalued today, which is hard to get excited about, but the company is super safe and the share repurchases going forward should provide somewhat of a floor. There's been a lot of talk about Berkshire stock underperforming, but this is nonsense. This chart shows Berkshire versus the S...00 Index over the past decade since the market bottomed on March 9, 2009...       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/050719-EIR-brk.a-vs-spx.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/050719-EIR-brk.a-vs-spx.png</url> As you can see, Berkshire has kept up almost exactly with the market, which is incredible performance in my opinion, given that: a) Berkshire is ultra-conservative, with a huge cash hoard[10]... and b) the market has been driven by a handful of big tech stocks. To be clear, this is a \"stay rich\" stock, not a \"get rich\" stock. I think it will continue to keep up in a rising market and outperform meaningfully in a bear market. Best regards, Whitney Glenn's follow-up comments; Mercedes-Benz EQC1) In response to Glenn's analysis that I shared today, one reader wrote: You missed one part that the same banks will lend the shares to the convertible bond[11] guys and earn additional fees. Regardless, the CB is not as cheap as you say. CB holders are not getting 8.5% if they want to hedge credit risk by buying credit-default swaps. Call spread is generally the norm in tech names so nothing unusual there Glenn replied: I know. I was simplifying that part. Not everyone wants the CDS - the short is enough. If someone bought CDS, they would have done smaller short. And of course who makes the CDS fees? This is a banker honey pot. It is standard structure but 2% interest that with a conversion price up only 27.5% is the worst pricing I have seen. Especially so for a company with this vol. The interest rate was likely a full percentage point too high and the convert price should have been at least 35% above the current share price in my view. 2) From a friend: Here's Daimler's press release about its new EV: Mercedes-Benz EQC sales release ...art of production: Electrified Mercedes hits the road[12] Note the German price including VAT: 'net basic price of less than \u20ac60,000' - that's $67,210. Also, apparently the European range rating on the new WTLP cycle is BETTER than that of the base Model X!

A proposed law, the News Media Bargaining Code, would force us to provide you with a dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube, could lead to your data being handed over to big news businesses, and would put the free ser-vices you use at risk in Australia. You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</p><p>David Swan, The Australian, Tuesday: The consumer watchdog has dismissed as \"mis-information\" warnings from Google that proposed laws that would force it to negotiate a payment to news organisations to include their journalists' work on its services would lead to a \"dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube\". ACCC chairman Rod Sims said it was up to Google whether it started charging for its services \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \"The draft code will allow Australian news businesses to negotiate for fair payment for their journalists' work that is included on Google services. This will address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook,\" Mr Sims (said). \"A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy.\"</p><p>Chris Griffith, The Australian, Tuesday: (Headline:) Google knows your every move even with \"location history\" off. Tests conducted by The Australian in Sydney \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 show the technology giant tracks the phone's movement even when those settings, ostensibly meant to protect the privacy of users, are -activated. Australian Privacy Foundation chairman David Vaile said \"(tech platforms have) proven time and time again that they're unwilling to -accept restraints on their data-collection practices. They have essentially kept harvesting the data while giving a misleading impression that they have obeyed your wishes.\"</p><p>Douglas Murray, UnHerd, May 29: (Just) as the tech platforms have allowed a great flowering of online debate, discussion and information-sharing, so the power of these companies to shut off that debate, by de-platforming or muting content they do not approve of, is an issue that becomes more troubling by the month \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 an UnHerd interview with respected oncologist Professor Karol Sikora was, bizarrely, taken down by YouTube. According to the tech giant's website, the interview was found to have \"violated guidelines\" because the high-profile immunity specialist was critical of the lockdown policy \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 For years, the company has been hiding or removing content it didn't approve of, and whenever public attention was brought to the matter YouTube would simply blame error or oversight.</p><p>Sacked Google engineer James Damore, Wired, January 16, 2018: Last year I wrote an internal document calling for a more open discussion of Google's diversity policies, citing research on average gender differences between men and women. Before it went viral, responses from co-workers ranged from \"I totally agree\" to \"Is this true?\" or \"I disagree because \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Once it leaked, rational discussion was impossible: Extreme voices got amplified. It was all about \"Oh, this sexist pig\" or \"Those leftists are all stupid.\" One manager said, \"I intend to silence these views; they are violently offensive.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 When whole topics become taboo - like the idea that there are gender differences - many issues become impossible to solve.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-e7baac5ae0e311eabdafff501d2e3ad35433f7cdda5be3b5cc57d01e2ae910a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MG-RBJ1-F0JP-W0WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hacking and identity theft are global concerns. Years of data security lapses that have left millions of people exposed show the need for standards and laws that have more teeth than fines, which too many companies seem to regard as just another cost of doing business.</p><p>But giving people greater control over their own data is another matter -- and an existential one for Big Tech.</p><p>Consider that 99 percent of Facebook's revenue, and 85 percent of Google parent Alphabet's, came last year from advertising. That advertising is increasingly tailored to people based on their online habits -- the websites they visit, the searches they conduct, their public and private conversations, even the content of their emails.

Imagine what would happen to Facebook's business model if every user had the option of controlling the use of their data entirely.</p><p>The more people learn about how their data is used nefariously, the more the case for regulation and greater personal control grows. We saw it in Russia's highly targeted political propaganda to stir discord and influence the 2016 election.

There are financial implications to this discussion for everyone who uses the web. For starters, in exchange for control over personal data -- and the loss of revenue it would likely mean for companies that have been monetizing our information for years -- are people willing to pay to use many of the sites and services they've long enjoyed for free?</p><p>This is a big and long-overdue discussion, and we don't disagree that Big Tech should have a seat at the table.

By the end of a given year, that's nearly a million touches, rising to two million if you're a power user[1].Each one of those taps, swipes and pulls is a potential proxy for our most intimate behaviors. Our phones are not only tools that help us organize our day but also sophisticated monitoring devices that we voluntarily feed with interactions we think are private. The questions we ask Google, for instance, can be more honest than the ones we ask our loved ones -- a \"digital truth serum,\" as ex-Googler and author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz writes in Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are.Hoover up these data points and combine them with all of our other devices -- smart TVs, fitness trackers, cookies that stalk us across the web -- and there exists an ambient, ongoing accumulation of our habits to the tune of about 2.5 quintillion (that's a million trillion) bytes of data per day.Sometimes that data gets spliced, scattered and consolidated across a web of collaborators, researchers and advertisers. </p><p>Acxiom, for instance, claims[2] 1,500 data points for each of the 500 million people in its database, including most US adults. Just in the past few months, Facebook was reported[3] to have asked hospitals, including Stanford University School of Medicine, to share and integrate patients' medical data with its own (the research project has since been put on hold). In April, gay dating app Grindr was revealed to have shared[4] customers' HIV status with two app-optimization companies. And who suspected completing an online personality test would pave the way for President Donald Trump's targeted political advertising[5]?In short, the close relationships we have with our devices are not monogamous. But what's a privacy-valuing citizen who still wants or needs to partake in our fabulously networked 21st-century society to do?There likely could not be a more timely moment for the public to care about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's superlatively complex, contested, sweeping data-privacy law that came into force on May 25.Its key rights include access to personal data, explanations of the algorithms that shape citizens' lives, portability (or moving your data from one company to another) and deletion. Years in the making, it affects any global organization's business in the European Union, leading companies worldwide to spend millions of dollars bringing their privacy standards into compliance, in some cases standardizing their practices outside the EU too.So we decided to test the system. A team of nine Engadget reporters in London, Paris, New York and San Francisco filed more than 150 subject access requests -- in other words, requests for personal data -- to more than 30 popular tech companies ranging from social networks to dating apps to streaming services. We reached out before May 25 -- when previous laws for data access existed in the EU -- as well as after, to see how procedures might have changed.The EU has had a data-protection directive since 1995, yet studies have repeatedly shown[6] that its rights weren't well-enforced. The GDPR has been law since 2016, yet it only grew teeth this May, with companies now open to fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue. The EU has had a data-protection directive since 1995, yet studies have repeatedly shown that its rights weren't well-enforced Indeed, the history of data privacy is really a tale of violation without meaningful justice. For example, hacked credit agency Equifax is still in business, and its customers can't even cut ties with it if they wish[7] to. In the UK, Facebook was fined 500,000 ($640,000) for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the maximum sum under laws at the time of the incident -- but also equal to the amount of cash the company makes every five-and-a-half minutes[8].If the same thing happened today, Facebook could be hit with fines potentially in the billions of dollars. Already, about 1,000 US-based news websites including the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune are inaccessible[9] in the EU, and in a recent Deloitte survey[10] only about a third of organizations could say they were fully compliant.The hope is that the GDPR will be a gold standard for how to feasibly check the power of big tech companies whose market value dwarfs the GDP of some of the countries trying to hold them accountable.We contacted companies by email or through their websites where they specified a method in their privacy policies, or we sent a letter when they didn't. (Instagram, for instance, only added an email address for data requests on May 25 and didn't reply to our mailed request.) Our letter was a modified version of the template[11] on the UK Information Commissioner's Office's website, quoting directly from the relevant laws. We asked for information on what data was held on us, where it came from, who it's been sent to and how we've been profiled, among other questions. What we requested Our access requests were based on this template[12] from the UK Information Commissioner's Office. Before May 25 we quoted from the UK's Data Protection Act of 1998 or a similar law in the subject's home country. After May 25, we cited Article 15 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.Specifically, we asked for: Any and all personal data an organization was holding on usThe categories of personal data concernedAn explanation of the purpose of collecting the dataWho has received or will receive the dataHow long the personal data will be stored and the criteria used to determine that periodIf the personal data was not collected directly from the data subject, where it was collected fromIf the data was used in any automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4); meaningful information about the logic involved; and the significance and the envisaged consequences for the data subject We included identifying information (name, address, email, phone number) and a copy of an identification document such as a driver's license. We noted that under the GDPR, access requests must be responded to within a month.Our requests were made from personal email and home addresses, in an effort to be treated as much like regular consumers as possible. In most cases, we sent follow-up questions identifying ourselves as reporters.\"Data requests are a window into the soul of on organization,\" said Hadi Asghari, an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, whose research has shown how little EU access laws have been adhered to in recent years. And we made unexpected discoveries: the distorted, fun house mirror profile that Acxiom held on one reporter; a kink app with lax security practices; a dating service that sent us a stranger's data. But we also saw the wildly divergent extents to which companies are adjusting to the GDPR. Personal information is the commodity that fuels the big data economy, and like all commodities, there's a fight for its control.Data Retrieval How big tech manages your personal information Tuesday: Who controls your data?[13]Wednesday: My digital shadow looks nothing like meThursday: How a data request turned into a data breachFriday: Don't ask me for my passwordSaturday: A date with my Tinder data There is an elephant in the room to address here: Understanding data privacy is fundamentally boring, if not unintelligible, to a regular user.Privacy policies are the backbone of understanding data rights. They're also legalese-packed documents thousands of words long and describe an infrastructure of data movement that many companies can't keep track of themselves. Reading every privacy policy you encounter in a year would take 76 full workdays, according to a 10-year-old study[14] by Carnegie Mellon researchers (and consider how many more apps we encounter daily in 2018). To not read them is a basic, wholly understandable human aversion toward ennui.This touches on what academics call the digital-privacy paradox. When polled, people say they care deeply about privacy, but in reality, they will give up their data or even the email addresses of their friends in exchange for something as trivial as a pizza[15].It's with this in mind that we waded through all sorts of corporate responses to our data requests: emails, Excel spreadsheets, data-download tools. Beyond simply what was given to us, would it be understandable, even meaningful?Netflix, for instance, provided full glossaries for its tables of data in a single PDF. Beyond simply what was given to us, would the data be understandable, even meaningful? Spotify, in contrast, provided its data through an online-download function. Inside, one UK-based reporter received 101 JSON files, and another received 90. While admirably comprehensive, these are dumps from databases normally read by computers: There's no way to reasonably make sense of the file names, let alone their plain-text contents. Spotify Customer Service did not provide full explanations of the file names, and a spokeswoman said while we could ask about specific data fields, the company did not have a glossary for all of its files.(A third reporter who made an identical request from the US received only seven files with basic information like payment methods, playlists and followers. The spokeswoman said that \"there are no differences to the information shared based on countries\" and that worldwide users could request additional files by contacting customer service, but this interaction points to an obvious conundrum: How do you ask for files that you don't know exist?)Instagram, too, offered its data -- aside from copies of photos and videos -- in reams of plain-text JSON files, which a spokeswoman justified as a more portable format. The right to portability, however, is separate from the right to access one's data.At least it provided some information. Dating app Bumble sent a UK reporter nothing more than basic personal info (name, age, language), the photos he'd uploaded and the last year of IP addresses and login times. A request from a US-based reporter went unanswered for more than a month; the company eventually provided data 12 weeks later.Another common theme was for companies to serve up sections of their privacy policy in reply to data requests, essentially telling us their general policy for data use but not what happened to our data specifically.Snapchat, for instance, referred us to its privacy policy, which states that it \"may\" procure information about us from affiliates and third parties or share our data with them, though it does provide a list[16] of who those parties may be. Tinder said it \"may\" receive information about us from partner organizations, without specifying who. Upon asking Tinder's public relations team for clarification, we received no response.The Article 29 Working Party, formerly a nonbinding guidance group made of EU representatives and data experts, has said that \"language qualifiers such as 'may', 'might', 'some', 'often' and 'possible' should ... be avoided\" in replying to data requests. Legally, the GDPR demands that any communication is \"in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.\" Yet we found this to be incredibly inconsistent.Researchers made a similar conclusion in July. An artificial intelligence analysis of 14 privacy policies (including those from Amazon, Microsoft and Uber) developed by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and the European University Institute in Florence found[17] that a third of clauses were \"potentially problematic\" or provided insufficient information.How do you ask for files that you don't know exist?The key to understanding how our data is used, however, is to see how it's analyzed. The categories we are put into and how our behavior is modeled have a profound effect on how we use technology. Unsurprisingly, most companies kept this information buttoned up.The GDPR provides for full explanations as well as the ability to opt out of automated decision-making and profiling when it involves \"legal\" or \"similarly significant\" effects. While it's unclear precisely how the latter is defined, it likely relates to decisions like credit scores, university admissions and issues involving health or employment.Thus, Netflix said nothing more about why we were recommended certain films other than that those recommendations were \"driven by members' viewing activity and service interactions.\" The posts we see on Instagram are ranked, according to the company, on \"timeliness of the post, your connection to the person posting, and the likelihood you'll be interested in the content.\" Tinder claimed to have moved away from the desirability rating named an Elo score[18] it assigned to every user but said that \"we cannot provide any information that reveals or otherwise compromises all or any part of our proprietary trade secrets or know how, which risks potential infringement of such intellectual property.\"One insight into how our data is processed is through Facebook's \"ad interests,\" a list of 357 categories I had been placed into for advertisers to match me with. There were obvious ones (\"writer,\" \"Liverpool FC,\" \"soul music\"), questionable cases (\"First Epistle to the Thessalonians\") and some whose definitions I didn't entirely understand (\"excited state,\" \"reality,\" \"outlaw\"). There's no specific explanation for why I was assigned these interests, and a Facebook spokesman declined to explain, though users can remove themselves from categories. The spokesman said the categories were based only on how you engage with Facebook pages and did not consider other information the company may have on you like location data or browsing history. My Facebook data dump noticeably increased after May 25th, from 10 advertisers with my contact info to 180. I could also see advertisers on Facebook who already had my contact details from elsewhere. Those included foreign versions of services I already use (EA Sports Norway) and instances where I knew I'd provided my email but did not know they'd track me down here: the venue for a preview of a friend's musical, the e-retailer where I bought a backpack, a half-marathon I ran two years ago.My Facebook data dump also noticeably increased before and after May 25th: from 10 advertisers with my contact info to 180. My ad interests swelled from 198 to 357. One representative from Facebook told me the former was due to a bug that caused fewer advertisers to be shown between October 2017 and April 2018; another rep told me the latter was due to fluctuations in the ad categories Facebook maintains. Both denied the change was related to the GDPR.There are three types of data, said Frederike Kaltheuner, a data privacy and security expert at London-based nonprofit Privacy International. The first is data that you consciously give companies: your name, email, date of birth. The second is automatically monitored: where you log in from, what time you do it, where else you visit on the web. The third and most difficult to obtain is data that's modeled or predicted from other data, such as your quantified attractiveness or trustworthiness.\"A lot of organizations don't consider modeled data to be personal data,\" said Kaltheuner. \"The main misunderstanding is people only ever think about the data that they actively share. And also companies love to talk about the data that we share.\" \"The main misunderstanding is people only ever think about the data that they actively share.\" This is why, essentially, the Cambridge Analytica scandal was an outrage. We already know that companies amass data on us. What we don't know is how they interpret that data and then use it to influence[19] our lives.When we ask companies for all the data and profiling they do on us and they provide us back only the data we've given to them, they may not only be omitting stray details but also furthering the idea that this is all our personal information is used for. We might think we're trading our data for a service we can see -- input our location to Google Maps, get directions to the cinema -- but how companies process that data is more opaque -- tracking our location to tell others how busy the theater is or which roads to avoid. (Google, it was recently revealed[20], will even track where you are when you turn location sharing off.) Facebook has also come under fire for researching both how to manipulate[21] users' emotions and (separately) how to identify[22] when they're in psychologically vulnerable states. Just recently, we learned[23] it's giving users reputation rankings too -- naturally without explaining how they're calculated. In short, data is our currency, but we often don't know how much we're truly paying. How to request your data from a tech company A key way to understand how the personal information ecosystem works is to request your own. Since the GDPR came into force, most companies have provided a mechanism of sorts for requesting data.The most straightforward are data-download functions, although they're often a dump of everything you've uploaded or posted, without a lot of context on what's happened to it. For example, here are instructions on a few major sites: Google[24]Facebook[25]Snapchat[26] For more details, it helps to reach out to the companies directly with specific, legally robust questions. There are tools to help: My Data Request[27] is a comprehensive database of how to reach 111 major companies, with template letters according to where you live. However, for some companies like Facebook, the site doesn't provide contact details and only refers users to data-download functions.Access My Info[28] is an easy-to-use data-access tool for Canadian residents, developed by nonprofit Open Effect and the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab.My Data Done Right[29] is an upcoming access-request tool for EU residents launching in September by Dutch digital rights organization Bits of Freedom. Of course, you can always rummage through each company's privacy policy for details yourself -- many are linked at the bottom of a website or are easily searchable. To help with navigating them, PriBot[30] has developed a chatbot as well as an AI-driven visualization tool[31] that works with many of the internet's privacy policies.Making data requests is not only useful for you, the customer, but also in aggregate ought to encourage companies to clarify their policies, potentially for the first time. \"It forces companies to have practices in place to deal with these requests,\" said Privacy International's Kaltheuner. \"The more people do them, the more procedures there will be in place to actually respond to them adequately.\"We also faced mixed answers to an apparently simple question: Who else has my data?Evernote, for instance, has a full online list of its 17 third-party vendors (PayPal, Zendesk) as well as an explanation of what each one is used for. Tinder, in contrast, doesn't list the names of its third-party vendors, only mentioning that \"third parties\" and \"advertising partners\" may receive user data.In a recent Deloitte survey[32] 56 percent of organizations said they have yet to figure out what data they have passed to third parties or how the new law will affect it. An additional 10 percent hadn't addressed whether their policies on third parties fit with the GDPR at all.Before the GDPR, it was not the norm for organizations to have a clear data map of everywhere the information they hold goes, said Bret Cohen, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells who specializes in privacy and cybersecurity. \"The GDPR, more than any other law or event, spurred organizations to really look under the cover and figure out what exactly they were doing with data,\" he said. \"It was a real motivator.\"Asghari, from Delft University of Technology, noted that company sharing of third-party names was also commonly lacking in his research. \"They are not even sure themselves who the data is shared with,\" he said.There was also no standardized process for organizations to verify our identities for data requests.Bumble requested two emailed identification documents, suggesting a driver's license, passport, birth certificate or bank statement. Spotify asked for the last four digits of a credit card on file, emphasizing not to send the entire card number. Services like Twitter, Google and LinkedIn had us make requests via web forms when we were already logged into our accounts and asked for nothing more. This raises a question of how easily your personal data could be hacked: If someone spoofed your email address or gained access to one of your accounts, would companies hand over your data to them?\"The main takeaway is to not gather more information than what you need to. If you're not in the business of collecting copies of driver's licenses or passport photos, don't collect them,\" said Jeewon Kim Serrato, US head of data protection, privacy and cybersecurity at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. \"Data minimization is really the foundational privacy principle. ... You should only keep the data that is providing value. And if it is no longer providing a service to the customer, it is now basically causing costs [for] the company.\" \"You should only keep the data that is providing value ... if it is no longer providing a service to the customer, it is now basically causing costs [for] the company.\" This is a complete reworking of the data-grabbing mindset. The ethos has long been to collect as much of the shimmering resource as possible, without necessarily knowing how it will be used in the future. \"Storage of data is getting cheaper and cheaper, and so actually deleting it in a proper way requires sometimes more financial investments than just keeping it forever,\" said Serrato. The GDPR might change that calculus: The costs of handling valuable data are now too high if you don't know exactly what you're going to do with it.Still, this is just a snapshot of a sprawling law that will be molded and refined through national legislation and test cases for years to come.\"There are certainly some companies playing the waiting game for a number of reasons, but I would say primarily based on the cost of compliance,\" said Cohen, of Hogan Lovells. \"The companies who see themselves as the primary enforcement target are doing everything that they can to comply.\"Experts expect enforcers to target the big tech companies first, particularly those in consumer-facing businesses: social media, mobile apps, health, advertising and self-driving cars as well as companies marketing to children. Data regulators in the UK, Ireland and France all say[33] complaints and reports of data breaches have shot up since the GDPR came into force. California recently passed[34] a digital privacy law that will go into effect in January 2020, viewed as a major step forward for data protection in the US, where there is no comparably comprehensive legislation.Meanwhile, officials are talking tough about slapping fines on violators. \"Clearly, abuse has become the norm. The aim of the EU data protection agency that I lead is to stop it,\" Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Union's data protection supervisor, writes[35]. \"The public will see the first results before the end of the year.\" All eyes will be on the first major case brought against a big tech company under the GDPR -- and, crucially, the amount the regulators choose to penalize them with. It will be the strongest indicator yet of whether this ambitious law can truly level the playing field between consumers and today's data barons.Credits:Writer: Chris IpFeatures editor: Aaron

Almost 60 percent of respondents said that the government should review and rate health apps, while 31 percent said that the government should fund a separate organisation to perform the role.</p><p>The survey is the first to be undertaken through Australia's Health Panel which has been established by the Consumers Health Forum to harness community sentiment on contemporary consumer health issues.</p><p>It also found that consumers were most likely to trust recommendations by general practitioners and pharmacists on health and wellbeing apps. The results indicate that consumers trust their peers to give good recommendations on apps, but not completely. 'Big tech' avenues such as search engines like Google and Apple are much less likely to be trusted sources of health apps advice.</p><p>The CEO of the Consumers Health Forum, Leanne Wells, said the survey results highlighted the growing public demand for credible and effective oversight of health apps given their accelerating reach into every aspect of health care.</p><p>\"As consumers increasingly turn to health apps to aid and monitor their health and treatment, there's clearly a need for people to know whether they can trust the apps, and whether they offer the best health option available and are worth the investment in time and money.</p><p>\"To ensure the health system makes the most of the rapid developments in digital technology now gripping health care, the Federal Government should be moving now to assess how best to support and regulate the safety and quality of health apps.</p><p>\"Given the rapid entry of health and wellbeing apps into health care, it is time now for the Government, consumers, health providers and app companies to come together to determine the fundamental principles that should govern this activity.</p><p>\"The CSIRO's recent Future of Health report (link is external) states that there were approximately 318,000 mobile health apps as at last year. While that presents increasing opportunities for consumers to manage their own health, many remain unregulated despite making health claims, and they have no accountability for health outcomes.</p><p>\"As the CSIRO report suggests, highly engaged consumers are demanding faster, cheaper, more personalised and preventative health solutions. There is enormous benefit to be gained by more widespread use of health and wellbeing apps to monitor and self-manage health conditions, but also to 'nudge' good lifestyle behaviours and choices,\" said Ms Wells.</p><p>\"However, the digital divide in the community is real: enhancing digital health literacy for people to benefit from this technology is becoming more important. As the CSIRO report says we need to develop robust consumer rating tools, symptom checker apps, and publicly available information sources for such health services.</p><p>\"The value of the findings of Australia's Health Panel is that while they reflect the responses of a modest sample of 260 respondents, they nonetheless give an insight into how people are viewing this relatively new and still largely unregulated development in health care.</p><p>\"Importantly, the sentiments expressed by Panel participants flag areas where we need to do more research and policy development. When health and wellness apps are such that they start interacting with the more formal health system, further questions emerge such as whether they should form part of a treatment plan or even be prescribed and whether they should attract government funding in some form.</p><p>\"The survey highlights the important role Australia's Health Panel can play in bringing to policy-makers' attention the thinking of the community on vital issues,\" Ms Wells said.</p><p>Australia's Health Panel is a recent CHF initiative designed to complement the advice and insights we draw from our extensive membership.

Her husband is US Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  I have a message for politicians everywhere. It's time to stop bending over backwards for Big Tech and time to start listening to local businesses, which have been critical to growing our cities -- and our country.</p><p>By now, everyone has learned that New York city and state have persuaded the corporate leviathan Amazon to build its next headquarters in Queens. They did this by offering the company $3 billion in tax incentives and state grants. But New York was not the only city to bid for Amazon's next office. Elected officials in at least 20 cities -- from Los Angeles to Boston -- were tripping over themselves to offer Amazon their own sweetheart packages.</p><p>Such special treatment is not given to everyone. Local business owners, like me, find ourselves increasingly subject to fees and permitting expenses -- such as the byzantine corporate franchise taxes -- imposed by the same officials wooing Amazon with a favorable deal. </p><p>A particularly galling example of this disconnect? As some New York city and state politicians courted Jeff Bezos, others were deciding it would be OK to add to my expenses by requiring my Manhattan bookstore -- the third-generation-owned, 91-year-old Strand -- to be designated as a landmark building. </p><p>This alleged honorific would present me with a regulatory nightmare: When any building is designated a landmark, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission henceforth must approve all building changes -- from window repair and signage adjustment to the type of mortar used to repair a crack in the walls. The labyrinthine process for such approval places a burden that would cost us time and money -- as it does every other small business that is so designated. Maintaining the building would require hiring landmarking experts, architects and lawyers. This additional cost, on top of our already thin margins, could very well grind the Strand into bankruptcy. </p><p>After spending the majority of his life working at the Strand and saving his money for more than 60 years, my father, Fred Bass, purchased the building housing the Strand in 1996 to ensure the survival of his business. Ironically, his investment could be the undoing of his life's work. </p><p>Though there is one more hearing at which we can argue our case against landmark status, the odds are unlikely to favor us. The city has made clear its intention to force through the designation. </p><p>And now, as one group of New York City bureaucrats lands Amazon's next headquarters, another group of them fails to see the significance of protecting a working bookstore with 238 employees. </p><p>The Amazon deal is not directly related to the city's landmark commission proposal for the Strand -- but the situation certainly throws the irony of cities' kowtowing to Big Tech while they allow other businesses to suffer into sharp relief. And it's happening everywhere.</p><p>Take Reno, Nevada. Tesla received a $1.4 billion tax incentive to build a battery factory outside Reno. As public services have been decimated by depleted funding -- to pay for the incentive -- and an influx of out-of-state workers caused a spike in living costs, the longtime working-class residents have been left behind, many descending into poverty and homelessness. </p><p>Another high-profile handout is Foxconn, the huge Taiwanese manufacturer, which picked up more than $4 billion from Wisconsin taxpayers, courtesy of Wisconsin politicians, to build a plant in the southeastern corner of the state. Environmental regulations, a significant expense for any of Foxconn's local competitors, have been waived for the firm's development. And a portion of the 13,000 blue-collar jobs promised will now go to Taiwanese workers instead.</p><p>The fact is unless we stop them, local and state politicians will continue to advantage Big Tech over longstanding local businesses. And without the powerful team of lawyers necessary to take on City Hall, small businesses will continue to suffer.</p><p>This dismal reality demands immediate action, as local businesses serve a critical role in our cities. They are meeting places, cultural destinations and even town halls. If they cease to exist, we lose the character of our communities and the sweat equity of our neighbors. We forfeit the American promise of hard work and self-reliance.</p><p>There are alternative spending options for our local officials besides cash for jobs. Rather than importing Big Tech, identify strengths and weaknesses of local industry sectors and present financial support in terms of training and technology development to build on what current taxpayers have already started. Local money then stays local. </p><p>Do not simply focus on the political expediency of manufacturing gains: Recognize, too, the importance of service industry jobs in supporting the economy. And remember that education and infrastructure are high-impact investments that strengthen small businesses and their customer base. </p><p>The message to politicians is clear: Get your priorities in order and focus on the local issues that affect the businesses that have made, and will continue to make, your cities great. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It's time to stop bending over backwards for Big Tech and time to start listening to local businesses, which have been critical to growing our cities -- and our country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now, everyone has learned that New York city and state have persuaded the corporate leviathan Amazon to build its next headquarters in Queens. They did this by offering the company $3 billion in tax incentives and state grants. But New York was not the only city to bid for Amazon's next office. Elected officials in at least 20 cities -- from Los Angeles to Boston -- were tripping over themselves to offer Amazon their own sweetheart packages.</p><p>Such special treatment is not given to everyone. Local business owners, like me, find ourselves increasingly subject to fees and permitting expenses -- such as the byzantine corporate franchise taxes -- imposed by the same officials wooing Amazon with a favorable deal.</p><p>A particularly galling example of this disconnect? As some New York city and state politicians courted Jeff Bezos, others were deciding it would be OK to add to my expenses by requiring my Manhattan bookstore -- the third-generation-owned, 91-year-old Strand -- to be designated as a landmark building.</p><p>This alleged honorific would present me with a regulatory nightmare: When any building is designated a landmark, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission henceforth must approve all building changes -- from window repair and signage adjustment to the type of mortar used to repair a crack in the walls. The labyrinthine process for such approval places a burden that would cost us time and money -- as it does every other small business that is so designated. Maintaining the building would require hiring landmarking experts, architects and lawyers. This additional cost, on top of our already thin margins, could very well grind the Strand into bankruptcy.</p><p>After spending the majority of his life working at the Strand and saving his money for more than 60 years, my father, Fred Bass, purchased the building housing the Strand in 1996 to ensure the survival of his business. Ironically, his investment could be the undoing of his life's work.</p><p>Though there is one more hearing at which we can argue our case against landmark status, the odds are unlikely to favor us. The city has made clear its intention to force through the designation.</p><p>And now, as one group of New York City bureaucrats lands Amazon's next headquarters, another group of them fails to see the significance of protecting a working bookstore with 238 employees.</p><p>The Amazon deal is not directly related to the city's landmark commission proposal for the Strand -- but the situation certainly throws the irony of cities' kowtowing to Big Tech while they allow other businesses to suffer into sharp relief. And it's happening everywhere.</p><p>Take Reno, Nevada. Tesla received a $1.4 billion tax incentive to build a battery factory outside Reno. As public services have been decimated by depleted funding -- to pay for the incentive -- and an influx of out-of-state workers caused a spike in living costs, the longtime working-class residents have been left behind, many descending into poverty and homelessness.</p><p>Another high-profile handout is Foxconn, the huge Taiwanese manufacturer, which picked up more than $4 billion from Wisconsin taxpayers, courtesy of Wisconsin politicians, to build a plant in the southeastern corner of the state. Environmental regulations, a significant expense for any of Foxconn's local competitors, have been waived for the firm's development. And a portion of the 13,000 blue-collar jobs promised will now go to Taiwanese workers instead.</p><p>The fact is unless we stop them, local and state politicians will continue to advantage Big Tech over longstanding local businesses. And without the powerful team of lawyers necessary to take on City Hall, small businesses will continue to suffer.</p><p>This dismal reality demands immediate action, as local businesses serve a critical role in our cities. They are meeting places, cultural destinations and even town halls. If they cease to exist, we lose the character of our communities and the sweat equity of our neighbors. We forfeit the American promise of hard work and self-reliance.</p><p>There are alternative spending options for our local officials besides cash for jobs. Rather than importing Big Tech, identify strengths and weaknesses of local industry sectors and present financial support in terms of training and technology development to build on what current taxpayers have already started. Local money then stays local.</p><p>Do not simply focus on the political expediency of manufacturing gains: Recognize, too, the importance of service industry jobs in supporting the economy. And remember that education and infrastructure are high-impact investments that strengthen small businesses and their customer base.</p><p>The message to politicians is clear: Get your priorities in order and focus on the local issues that affect the businesses that have made, and will continue to make, your cities great.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190103amazon-big-tech-threat-cities-bass-wyden1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V54-8PS1-DY60-M1GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><timeReceived>5:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>amazon-big-tech-threat-cities-bass-wyden</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The government. People hate this answer, as they want it to beThe Internetbut, whenThe Internetfails, they want answers. </p><p>For example, when you order things on eBay or Amazon and they don't turn up, you want eBay and Amazon to be the government and sort it out. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't, but the most frustrating part is not knowing who to call Similarly, with Uber, Airbnb and more, you see the star rating and think the democracy ofThe Internetsorts out the winners from the losers. Well, truth be told, it does not. Accounts can be faked and star ratings rigged, so listen in y'all. Equally, when your bitcoins disappear up a MtGox backside, who ya gonna call? Cryptobusters? No, the government of the internet is the government. This is demonstrated by, after two decades of allowing development of the network without oversight, the G20 has finally woken up to the challenge[1]: 'Group of 20 finance ministers agree to compile common rules to close loopholes used by global tech giants to reduce their corporate taxes'. I've always said the G20 will create the rules for the network and finally they are.Now, I'm not saying I like this anymore than any of you do, but when things go wrong you need to have a supervisory authority to sort it out. This is why, for all the power that the internet places in our hands, there will still be an authority over it all. Why am I talking about this today? For a number of reasons but number one is Libra[2], the new digital currency of Facebook. Libra, by its name, implies it is freeing people. We are libertarian. We are freed. We are released from government. We can do our thing on the internet, without government. And there's the rub. It is the libertarian dream of the bitcoin movement. Money without government. But it will just never exist as money was invented by government for government. It is our control mechanism for taxes and for monitoring economic and social activity. Without it, there is no government. Now, I am accused of being a statist because I don't believe in a world without government. I believe we have to be governed. Or rather, I believe we have to have an authority who can sort out a mess, in an equitable and fair way, when things go wrong. Am I wrong? Is that bad? In a libertarian world, we have no oversight, no overlords, no supreme justice or, to be truthful, no justice at all. In a libertarian world, when things go wrong, we have the rule of the people. The people vote and give the thumbs up or thumbs down in a virtual world that reflects the old gladiatorial rings of old. But this is where I take exception. In a gladiatorial world, where the majority public rule gives the thumbs up or down, what happens when you're the one losing? And what happens if there are only a small number online at that time? And what happens if they don't listen to the whole story but just the part they want to hear? Can we see a future with no courts, no rules, no laws, no justice? Just the rule of the common people based upon a star rating or a thumb up or down? What about the nuances and complexities of relationships, history, agreements and contracts? Can we just dump a millennium of legal precedents for the rule of the people online? I don't think so. I think we will always have governments, courts, rules and structures. The challenge in today's connected world however is that the internet does not recognise borders. The internet does not recognise countries, governments or structures. The internet is a global network without borders. This is a friction that regulatory occurs in debates about the future world: who governs the internet? How do you regulate a world without borders? What is the law when the transacting counterparties are without law? I think this will be the most interesting part of the development of Libra, the Facebook currency. Having had this debate for a decade about bitcoin, and my answer is that the law wins and governments rule, Libra will face the same criteria and challenge. In fact, it already is[3]. Nevertheless., the counterargument is that Mark Zuckerberg and his brethren are the governors of the internet. It reminds me of the quote from Jack Ma when I attended the Alibaba Netrepeneurs meeting two years ago[4]:'Management. The word is there for regular companies. At Alibaba we treat it more like governing an economy, as we have to manage so many companies dependent upon us as partners.'Are the Big Tech giants the new governments of the world through the network, or are the governments of the world going to manage the Big Tech giants through the network?

The sort of deal they have held up as the Brexit prize is contained in a blueprint published by rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, called Plan A+. Last week it was told to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">remove Plan A+ from its website by the Charity Commission, for breaking rules on political campaigning</url>.

Their starting position is that membership of the EU has stifled prosperity in the UK; they propose a bonfire of tariffs, quotas and anti-competitive rules. </p><p>The priority areas for removing \"anti-competitive\" EU regulations articulated in Plan A+ are unpicking data protection rules (GDPR) introduced by the EU to ensure privacy, and allowing the free flow of data across borders, which would let big tech companies use our data - or abuse it. EU regulations that require exporters using chemicals to present safety data to the European commission before obtaining authorisation for imports are a burden on business, including the plastics sector, the thinktanks say, and should go. Likewise pharmaceuticals companies find the requirements on transparency around clinical trials onerous and should be allowed longer patents - that is, more expensive drugs for the rest of us.</p><p>All services and government procurement should be opened to international competition. While these thinktanks acknowledge that opening up the NHS might be too controversial, they think it a good idea. And protections designed to avoid workers being exploited or undercut by cheap migrant labour, which, for example, limit the number of hours people can be asked to work, or require parity of pay with local workers for those posted abroad, should be removed, says Plan A+. The same goes for environmental protections, food standards and the precautionary principle that the EU favours when assessing risk.</p><p>The US sees many of these rules as protectionist, Plan A+ explains. It says that in order to persuade the US to make concessions that would allow the UK's services sector greater access to its markets, Britain will have to make concessions on standards the Americans find irksome, especially in food, agriculture and other goods. The things the US complains about and wants conceded include limits on pesticide residues and hormone-disrupting chemicals in food, nutritional labelling, the use of genetically modified organisms, the export of animal byproducts including some specified risk material for BSE, food additives such as flavourings that the EU has banned because of concerns over safety, hygiene rules including chlorine treatments on poultry and other meats, and animal-rearing standards such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">the use of growth-promoting chemicals in pork and hormones in beef production</url>.</p><p>Plan A+ is most detailed on financial services after Brexit, where it suggests a wide range of deregulatory measures. Suddenly the agenda is not general at all, but very specific indeed. It reads like special pleading for particular bank, hedge fund and wealth manager interests. Proposals include reducing some of the capital requirements on banks, and lifting several controls on asset managers' trading. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">bank surcharge</url>, which claws back some of the huge cost to the taxpayer of bailing out the sector after the 2007-08 financial crash, and was introduced to deter banks taking on riskier debt, should be cut. Controls on CFDs (contracts for difference - a form of algorithmic trading in which funds trade on the small fluctuations in asset prices without ever owning the assets) should be scrapped, as should some controls on short-selling, and caps on large fund trading volumes designed to prevent excessive swings in markets, especially in vital commodities. The EU directive on markets in financial instruments is described as burdensome to wealth managers because it requires extensive trade-tracking data to be provided to regulators. Although regulation is mostly inimical to free markets, the US will want stronger intellectual property rights regulation to encourage venture capital.</p><p>The lead author of Plan A+ is a former Washington lobbyist and trade lawyer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">Shanker Singham</url>. This is the second time his reports have fallen foul of the Charity Commission over overt political activity, which is not permitted when organisations claim charitable status.

The thinktanks, bar one, belong to the libertarian       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">Atlas network</url>, which describes itself as a partnership connecting free-market organisations around the world \"to the ideas and resources needed to advance the cause of liberty\".</p><p>Their personnel overlap, as do <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/why-does-donald-trump-oppose-theresa-may-brexit-deal\">their funders</url>, in so far as they are known. Most are not revealed. They say their funding does not influence their thinking. But we know enough about their donors to see plutocratic and corporate interests at work. US billionaires' trusts, big oil, big food, tobacco and tax havens are among those identified as givers by the Guardian.</p><p>This push for ultra-free trade looks like shock doctrine, the exploitation of a crisis to push through highly controversial policies while everyone is too distracted to fight them off. What unites these interests is an antipathy towards the EU's ability to rein in their power. The target is the EU that signs up to climate agreements, is prepared to consider a financial transaction tax, is chasing down corporate tax dodgers, challenging monopoly control, and is a threat to tech giants, hedge funds, wealth managers and fossil fuel barons - especially in the US. In the UK, we have been so worried about Russian interference in our elections that we are in danger of missing the source of money nearer home.</p><p>This is not what people voted for, or even realised they were being asked to vote for in the referendum. But that's the trouble with shadow political power structures. Their true shape and purpose stays hidden while they capture democracy.</p><p> Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-49772076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWF-NP41-JCJY-G0XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1158\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p>Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. Up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. One employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and Apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate Russia, which disagrees that Ukraine includes Crimea and the Donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014.</p><p>And Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, Yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam.</p><p>And in 2018, Reuters reported that, \"UN human rights experts investigating a possible (Rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, YouTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded. That will at least be a start.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p>Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. Up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. One employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and Apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate Russia, which disagrees that Ukraine includes Crimea and the Donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014.</p><p>And Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, Yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam.</p><p>And in 2018, Reuters reported that, \"UN human rights experts investigating a possible (Rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, YouTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded. That will at least be a start.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the united states, section 230 of the Communications decency act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of u.s. President donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in american history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's Ceo, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. one employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate russia, which disagrees that ukraine includes Crimea and the donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014. and Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam. and in 2018, reuters reported that, \"un human rights experts investigating a possible (rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\" on Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, youTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. republicans and democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded.

This is because of a 1996 law in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. Up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. One employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and Apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate Russia, which disagrees that Ukraine includes Crimea and the Donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014.</p><p>And Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, Yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam.</p><p>And in 2018, Reuters reported that, \"UN human rights experts investigating a possible (Rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, YouTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded. That will at least be a start. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p>Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. Up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. One employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and Apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate Russia, which disagrees that Ukraine includes Crimea and the Donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014.</p><p>And Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, Yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam.</p><p>And in 2018, Reuters reported that, \"UN human rights experts investigating a possible (Rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, YouTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded. That will at least be a start.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. Up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. One employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and Apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate Russia, which disagrees that Ukraine includes Crimea and the Donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014.</p><p>And Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for China until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. Civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, Yahoo handed information to Chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam.</p><p>And in 2018, Reuters reported that, \"UN human rights experts investigating a possible (Rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers. But the only remedy is to do what the Germans do, which is to legally require sites to remove hate posts immediately, or face fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>In February, Britain took Facebook, YouTube, Google and others to task and announced that its media regulator will police internet content. The government agency will impose penalties against companies that do not sufficiently combat \"harmful and illegal terrorist and child abuse content,\" or, presumably, other offences.</p><p>Fortunately, the policing issue may be addressed south of the border soon. Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that immunity for internet companies must be rescinded. That will at least be a start. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is because of a 1996 law in the united States, Section 230 of the communications decency act, which protects internet companies from liability for what appears on their platforms. They have parlayed this privilege into empires and exported licentiousness around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, one of the biggest social media sites - Twitter - broke ranks last month and decided to take responsibility for its content. up until then, its policing consisted only of kicking out those who flagrantly contravened its ethical standards, which forbids bullying, threatening or inciting violence and hate speech. But in May, due to a growing backlash, Twitter finally factchecked and flagged several of u.S. President donald Trump's inaccurate tweets.</p><p>The president was infuriated and immediately launched an attack, accusing Twitter of censorship and interfering in the 2020 election campaign. He pledged to \"defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in american history.\"</p><p>Facebook posted Trump's Tweets on its site without alteration and also played the \"free speech\" card. Then Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's ceo, swiped Twitter for its new-found morality, and said that Facebook was not the \"arbiter of the truth.\" Within days, some employees staged a virtual walkout in protest. one employee, Lauren Tan, took to Twitter to say that, \"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here.... Silence is complicity.\"</p><p>Twitter founder Jack dorsey responded to Zuckerberg, saying: \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.... We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"</p><p>The free speech defence is nonsense, considering that all other content providers - including newspapers, TV stations and advertisers - are obliged to fact check, edit and remove inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious speech. If they do not, they are legally liable for damages.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's immunity has made it arrogant and has also led to collaborations with some unseemly regimes. For example, Google and apple recently redrew the borders on their maps to placate russia, which disagrees that ukraine includes crimea and the donbas region, which it illegally invaded in 2014. and Facebook's \"free speech\" posturing is laughable considering that it developed censorship tools for china until critics forced it to drop those plans. The site has also been accused of deactivating the accounts of dozens of Tunisian, Syrian and Palestinian activists and journalists. civil liberties and human rights groups have argued that this shows that Facebook's dedication to free speech is geographically disparate.</p><p>In 2006, yahoo handed information to chinese authorities about an activist user that led to him being imprisoned. In 2020, Facebook agreed to censor \"anti-state\" posts made by users in Vietnam. and in 2018, reuters reported that, \"un human rights experts investigating a possible (rohingya) genocide in Myanmar said that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.\" on Thursday, Facebook announced it would start labelling objectionable posts just as Twitter did, after being hit with boycotts by major advertisers.

An equally revealing reaction, however, has come from China, which sees Libra as a threat to the comfortable lead it has enjoyed in financial technology or \"fintech\" since 2013. US officials need to pay attention to China's response before setting rules that would stifle Facebook's innovation before it can get off the ground.</p><p>As envisioned by Facebook, Libra is a currency existing in digital format that could be used to make payments or money transfers. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which have become sources of boom-and-bust speculation, Libra is supposed to have a stable value, backed by a reserve of safe assets like bank deposits and US Treasury bonds. Libra will be created only when real money is exchanged for it, and it will in turn be destroyed when a holder cashes out into fiat currency like dollars or euros. Though described by many as a cryptocurrency, Libra aims to be something different. The supply of bitcoin, for example, is controlled by computer code, with a valuation that fluctuates wildly. Users of bitcoin have made millions and lost millions. Facebook claims that it will not control Libra and promises that it will hand over currency management to the Swiss-based Libra Association.</p><p>Pushed out seamlessly to Facebook's 2.4 billion users, Libra could transform ecommerce and finance overnight. The idea is powerful, and the backlash was not surprising. Facebook's dismal track record of protecting user data and privacy has made regulators and politicians uneasy. Fears abound that Libra could give Facebook excessive power, facilitate money laundering, finance terrorism, reduce the ability of governments to manage money supply and economies, and threaten global financial stability. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised these concerns at a recent congressional hearing, and Democrats have already drafted a \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act\" to make Libra or anything like it illegal.</p><p>China's concerns are quite different. Its top fintech companies have over a billion users accustomed to carrying out commercial and business transactions in what is becoming the world's biggest cashless society. Chinese fintech companies are among the world's most valuable. They are expanding from the United Kingdom to Southeast Asia. With Libra, Facebook could leapfrog China by pushing out its currency to almost 2.5 times the user base of WeChat or Alipay overnight, with a worldwide reach.</p><p>Facebook's new business strategy is exactly how WeChat in China became a super app. Mark Zuckerberg wants to \"build more ways for people to interact on top of [private messaging], including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other. . .services.\" Thus, ironically, after years of benefitting from copying others, China is wringing its hands over an American tech company copying Chinese innovation.</p><p>But if US regulators ban projects like Libra or bog them down with more regulations than are necessary to guard against real risk, the path will be open for Chinese fintech to extend its dominance around the world. Americans do not generally appreciate the extent to which China has innovated in the financial sector and is bound to leverage that innovation to extraordinary global influence. On the other hand, Chinese finance has many weaknesses that could provide an opportunity for American innovation.</p><p>Chinese Tech's Weakness Is America's Opportunity</p><p>WeChat and Alipay turned China into a cashless society where people use their apps for everything, while Americans still use billions of checks and carry plastic cards. So far, Chinese super apps have been truly successful only in their protected home market, where Facebook and Google are blocked and foreign payments companies cannot legally operate. Outside China, Ant Financial and WeChat must start from scratch because they lack the users and ecosystems that made them so successful at home.</p><p>American tech is the opposite. US tech companies have succeeded wildly beyond American shores. Facebook's nearly 2.4 billion total users attest to the company's enormous advantages in data, users, and technology. There is no telling what additional advantages could accrue from its model being successfully applied to finance. The Libra project signals that American big tech's timidity over entering finance is coming to an end. Former governor Zhou Xiaochuan of China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), who is one of the foremost cheerleaders of fintech in China, framed Libra as indicative of a larger movement to create a \"currency that's more conducive to globalization.\" Globally Facebook has the same strengths that Chinese tech had domestically, so China knows Libra could rapidly make Facebook a financial powerhouse.</p><p>That is why Chinese officials see Libra as an economic and geopolitical threat. They have long been unhappy about the dollar's dominance in the global financial system and are frightened by the prospect of an American company dominating the future world of digital money. Wang Xin, research bureau director at PBOC, said Libra has lent greater urgency to the central bank's own plans for a digital currency, which have been in the works since 2014, in partnership with Ant Financial. He noted, \"We had an early start...but lots of work is needed to consolidate our lead,\" and he lumped Facebook in with the US government, warning that Libra could lead to a world with \"one boss, the Dollar, America.\"</p><p>China has the strictest regulation on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in the world, fearing a loss of control that could be posed by rival currencies to the Chinese renminbi, financial risk from speculation, and evasion of its capital controls. But in a striking reversal, Wang suggested that China may loosen its control to ensure China has a home-grown digital currency that would \"mainly be used to compete with Libra.\" He seems to be fine with anyone but the United States or an American company launching a digital currency, suggesting that individual countries could be forced to issue their own or that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could issue one based on the basket of currencies in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), which includes the Chinese yuan.</p><p>Another PBOC official, Payments Department Deputy Director-General Mu Changchun, warned rightly that Libra adoption could lead many to dump their national currencies, producing \"a deterioration in local people's own economic conditions.\" He said, \"We must prevent [currencies like Libra] from becoming monopolies,\" going as far as suggesting that international institutions will need to \"control Libra's circulation and monitor currency exchange rates\" or even \"lead to the emergence of an international central bank.\" In other words, China wants Libra bogged down in as many regulatory hurdles as possible, is warning other countries against allowing adoption in their jurisdictions, and if that fails, suggests an international effort to wrest control of Libra from Facebook.</p><p>How Worried Should China Be?</p><p>China should indeed take Libra seriously but not treat its success as a certainty. First, China's government can ensure Libra makes little to no inroads there by banning businesses and financial institutions from accepting, charging, or exchanging Libra. The Great Firewall already blocks Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram. The few Chinese Facebook users have no ecosystem to plug into.</p><p>Second, Facebook may find it difficult to convert users of social media into Libra holders. Lukewarm user reception for its payments service in Messenger and quick abandonment of Facebook Credits, its first virtual currency project, do not inspire confidence in its ability to drive adoption of its financial products.</p><p>Third, the US government has given every indication that it wants to slow down, not act as a cheerleader for Libra. The thinly veiled reference to China in the Senate testimony of David Marcus, head of Calibra, Facebook's financial services subsidiary, is pushing against broad resistance: \"If America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will. If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\" Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, requested \"a moratorium on any movement forward.\" President Donald Trump tweeted that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability\" and suggested it should be regulated like a bank. Fed Chair Powell said it \"raises a lot of serious concerns.\" The G-7 is also looking into regulatory issues raised by Libra.</p><p>Fourth, it is not clear that Facebook is justified in its claims that Libra will be an improvement over existing digital currency designs. If Libra turns out not to be that innovative, it may not pose a long-term threat to Chinese fintech innovators. So far, Libra seems vulnerable to the same pitfalls of existing digital currencies, including scalability and internal governance problems. The current design hopes to handle 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) at launch, nothing compared with Alipay, which claims to have reached 256,000 TPS in 2017, or Visa, at 65,000 TPS. Anyone who has attended a meeting of 100 people without a designated chairperson could intuit that the governance mechanism, aimed to comprise 100 founding members with each having a tiny official voting stake, is likely to either prove chaotic or be subject to behind the scenes domination by its most powerful and invested stakeholder.</p><p>If Libra were to lead China to innovate even more in financial services, the impact could be healthy. But if the Libra challenge leads China to prematurely adopt a still buggy and risky digital currency/blockchain side of fintech, the damage could be significant. American and European regulators should likewise find a middle ground. Blanket bans would leave China with limited competition as its powerful fintech business models expand globally, but important regulatory protections should not be jettisoned in order to compete with China. Unleashing a brand new digital behemoth without thinking the consequences through would be dangerous to all sides.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123070223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-XY61-JCBF-S0T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Whoop, which makes a sensor-equipped (and screen-free) strap that continuously tracks your activities 24/7 and then provides a multitude of performance metrics and other data based on that activity, has closed a round of $55 million, a Series D that it will use to continue expanding its business into a wider range of wearables and analytics that can be gathered around them.</p><p><br/>Today the devices measure things like how much strain a workout is causing you, how you are recovering afterwards, your sleep, whether training is having the desired effect, whether you are working at a level that will be less likely to cause injury and how you are likely to perform. Looking ahead, the plan is to bring the sensors into more places than just the strap it currently makes. \"You'll see Whoop over time worn throughout your body,\" CEO Will Ahmed said. \"The tech can live in other areas of the body, people will not even know you are wearing a sensor. We like the idea of tech being invisible while still being there.\"<br/>The funding brings the total to more than $100 million for the Boston-based company, and while Ahmed, who originally incubated the startup at Harvard with co-founders John Capodilupo and Aurelian Nicolae, said the valuation was not being disclosed, he did describe it as \"healthy\" - which I guess is appropriate for a health-tech company.<br/>For some context, PitchBook notes that its last round of $25 million, in 2018, was at $125 million, post-money. That would mean a minimum of $180 million here, although the \"healthy\" implies it is actually higher. (We'll continue to dig around and will update the number if we learn more.)<br/>Whoop doesn't disclose how many users it has currently, or anything about its financials, but its investor list is a good measure of the traction that Whoop has had to date, as a company pitching its product not just to the mass market, but to an elite group of sports people - who in turn are not just major athletes, but, in this day and age, major influencers when it comes to purchasing power.<br/>This latest round was led by Foundry Group - coincidentally also an investor in Fitbit - with participation from Two Sigma Ventures, Accomplice, Thursday Ventures, Promus Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. Individual investors included David Stern, the former NBA Commissioner; Ed Baker, former VP of product and growth at Uber, and former head of International Growth at Facebook; Marc Randolph, co-founder and first CEO of Netflix; and Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Media Lab.<br/>Previous backers of the company include the Durant Company,\u00a0the National Football League Players Association, Twitter\u00a0chief executive Jack Dorsey, Los Angeles Chargers offensive tackle Russell Okung and Mike Novogratz, the chief executive of Galaxy Digital.<br/>One notable shift Whoop has seen in the last year is that it has dropped the price of its wearable from an eye-watering $500 down to free. Instead, it bundles the strap into a wider membership program that you do pay for, starting at $30/month and decreasing, depending on what you would like to measure and use the data for (specifically, pricing is six months of data for $30/month; 12 months for $24/month; or 18 months for $18/month).<br/>Offering its devices for free is just one of the ways that Whoop diverges from the usual wearables story.<br/>At a time when wearables have become part of the gadget pantheon, equipped with screens and acting as little computers in their own right, Whoop has taken a very different turn, opting to build a device that looks nothing like a piece of electronics, even if behind the scenes it's using just as much AI and other powerful technology to crunch the data that its five sensors are continuously collecting.<br/>\"The dirty secret with wearables is that the more features you try to pack in to them, the less effective they are,\" Ahmed said. \"We have been deliberate about what we want our tech to do.

Apple has been seeing sales growth of its Watch outpace its other iconic products. Amazon is building a massive health services business that will likely also have a hardware component. And Google's acquisition of Fitbit (if it clears all regulatory and other hurdles) is a big sign of how the company also sees this area as one where it will want to have a seat at the table.<br/>\"Google buying Fitbit is a sign that health data will be a big piece of the future for tech companies,\" Ahmed said, pointing out that the company's lack of growth in device sales is a strong sign that Google bought it largely for its data capabilities. \"It puts a big value on data and what it's done there and suggests Google will use the data to create health products.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-287708</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGW-0BN1-JBYT-H410-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00040OW</classCode><className>RANDOLPH CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009A0I</classCode><className>SIGMA VENTURES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00024G9</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS333132 OIL &amp;

Now they're insisting it was just a trial programme, which is, of course, what any public relations adviser would tell a big company found to have been behaving with the sensitivity of a Victorian workhouse owner to say, whether it was true or not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch condemned the use of such tracking software as \"creepy\", and who could possibly argue with that? Workers said they couldn't even go to the toilet without being logged as away from their desks, and potentially asked to explain themselves. It's good to be reminded that individuals have some rights, even in this anxious age of job insecurity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there's still something a bit hollow at the sight of so many people getting their knickers in a twist because their boss is spying on them.</p><p>Everything's spying on everyone these days, including the technology which these same people willingly use in their free time. We all suspect our phones are listening in, however much it is denied.</p><p>How often have you been at home, idly chatting about needing to pick up shampoo, or biscuits, or whatever, and, the next time you switch on your phone, there are ads for the very same products? It's called surveillance capitalism.</p><p>One woman recently noticed that she'd started getting ads for pregnancy products and baby clothing, even though she wasn't having a baby. It turned out that she'd stopped using her \"period tracker\" app and it, and the third parties to which the makers of said app had been selling on data, assumed she was therefore with child.</p><p>Every song you ask Alexa to play on the Amazon Echo Dot, every video you watch on YouTube, gets fed through some unique algorithm, or however the heck this stuff works - because that's another factor, we don't really know how all this fits together, we just leave it to the billionaires and boffins in Silicon Valley to do their thing, and hope for the best - and soon your phone or tablet knows you better than you know yourself. We're spied on all the time. We've just chosen not to care.</p><p>It's like when people are shown where sausages come from. RTE presenter Philip Boucher-Hayes actually made some on The Late, Late Show a few years ago while plugging his health show What Are You Eating? Pig's rectums. Fat. Enough salt to empty a Siberian salt mine. Sodium tripolyphosphate - a common ingredient in detergent. It would be easier to list what didn't go in the sausages.</p><p>The audience at home was \"disgusted\", the headlines de-clared. The audience in the studio, who'd been treated to some cocktail sausages during that particular segment, even more so. People across the land pledged never to eat processed sausages again.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, everyone was tucking into a Full Irish, as if they'd never known the truth of what they were putting in their mouths.</p><p>\"Humankind cannot bear very much reality,\" as the poet TS Eliot once noted.</p><p>It's the same with technology. Those little devices we all carry around are designed to reward the brain with a constant diet of little treats so that it forgets what would bring it pain to remember, and recalls only the pleasure.</p><p>Yes, our phones spy on us, but they also let us watch Netflix on the bus to and from work, or ping repeatedly to notify us that someone else has liked that picture of our children on Facebook.</p><p>That's another contradiction, of course. The people who complain most loudly about online privacy are often the same ones who put their entire lives on the internet, often dragging in a host of family, friends and randomers who never consented to their faces appearing online.</p><p>A startup company in the US recently started selling software to police departments which claimed to be able to identify people from photographs. Such a tool is obviously of use to police looking to track down criminals, but it transpired that the database in the software was compiled by pulling images from \"open web\" sources such as Google, Facebook and Twitter without the owners' permission.</p><p>The company was subsequently served with cease and desist letters, but insists that it uses only publicly available data.</p><p>Most people when asked say they're comfortable with using facial recognition software to unlock their own phones, but, once your face becomes just another piece of data, is it still your own? Everything can be boiled down to usable nuggets of information which can then be sold on. Everybody knows this is how the internet works, but we're like celebrities, who say they want privacy but then demand attention when they have some new product to sell or message to pass on.</p><p>That we don't really understand the technology makes it harder to know what we're agreeing to when we sign up to a new service or tick those pop-up boxes which appear on never-before-visited websites.</p><p>A growing number claim to read the terms and conditions of the apps they download, but it's still far from being a majority. Most wouldn't understand the small print even if they did. Vaguely we're aware that it has something to do with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), but, beyond that, it's as fathomable to the average person as sorcery.</p><p>We just want to surf the internet, not study for a degree in computer science, and lawmakers are no more clued in to what's going on.</p><p>Even the candidates running in the US Democratic primary race for the right to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency in November appear baffled by technology.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren wants the CEOs of big companies to go to jail if they breach the privacy of a certain number of users. Bernie Sanders also says they should be prosecuted.</p><p>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg wants the US to adopt a GDPR system similar to that pioneered by the EU.</p><p>Other than that, gaps in the conversation are filled with the sound of crickets, and it was the same in the election here. Good luck finding any policies on online privacy from the major parties' manifestos.</p><p>Many have called for the big tech companies to be broken up or regulated, but that wouldn't solve the real problem, which is that surveillance is built into every aspect of the online world. That's how they make money. Lots of it.</p><p>The real irony is that the reason technology needs to spy on us at work, in the way that got Barclays Bank into trouble this week, is because technology also interferes with our ability to concentrate for sustained periods, unless it's on a new Netflix series.</p><p>The campaign group Privacy International says that \"people are entitled to some fundamental rights even if they are at work\", but do bosses not also have a right to be peeved if they're paying staff for a day's work and a goodly proportion of those hours is spent scrolling through each other's social media feeds? The tracking systems may even be doing us all a favour in the long run by keeping us away from time-wasting distractions. As Prof Neil Postman put it in his 1980s book about how television was dumbing down public discourse, we may well be \"amusing ourselves to death\".</p><p>The boss only demands your time. Technology colonises our very souls.</p><p/><p>'Everything</p><p>can be boiled</p><p>down to usable</p><p>nuggets of</p><p>information</p><p>which can thenbe sold on'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TECHNOLOGY: We all suspect our phones are listening in</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-157757791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8K-NHK1-JCBW-N4P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1252\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 23, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000210N</classCode><className>BARCLAYS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TAPR (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BCS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BARC (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001366</classCode><className>PREGNANCY &amp;

A consensus is fast emerging that Big Tech is a Big Problem - and that it will have to be regulated more closely, and some of the biggest internet companies may even have to be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But hold on. There is very little sign the customers mind about any of this. While the arguments over more and more draconian regulation become more intense, the tech giants keep reporting better and better results.</p><p>They are signing up vast quantities of new people and pushing into new industries. In fact, we risk destroying the most dynamic and innovative part of the global economy with a largely synthetic hysteria over their growing power. The European Union is leading the way with campaigns for tighter controls over the huge American companies that dominate the internet.</p><p>Next month, tough new laws on data privacy come into force. A turnover tax is planned to capture more of their profits. Massive fines running into billions have been imposed for restricting competition, with more on the way. There has even been talk of breaking up Google.</p><p>While the EU is making the running, the United States and the rest of the world are not far behind. President Trump has been leading an assault on Amazon, and there has been talk of turning both it and Google into regulated utilities as the only way of curbing their power.</p><p>Indeed, the International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said this month the IMF was looking at ways of controlling their power.</p><p>There are legitimate concerns. Google dominates internet search, and increasingly advertising as well.</p><p>Amazon dominates online retailing, and Facebook owns the social media industry. In many areas, they are virtually monopolies - and they always need to be carefully controlled.</p><p>And yet, if they were quite as bad as some politicians and campaigners think they are, you might imagine customers would be turning away from them. If so, there is very little evidence of it. In fact, the results have been better than ever.</p><p>This week, Amazon unveiled doubled first-quarter profits. It now has more than 100m Prime subscribers, despite a price rise, and sales across the company are now an extraordinary $550m (\u00a3400m) a day. Google easily beat expectations with its results, adding another 20pc to its already huge profits. Likewise, Facebook reported record results. And Netflix this month reported booming subscriptions despite a price rise some critics thought might be a step too far.</p><p>It is not as if any of them are selling essential services like food or clothing. We'd all get by fine without Facebook and if we really believed Amazon was destroying the world, there are still plenty of other places to buy a book, a new router, or a Lego activity set for the kids. They are growing so fast because we are in love with the products, and because the value and service they offer, and the levels of innovation, remain fantastic.</p><p>The hysterical clamour for regulation looks manufactured by a small political elite, and often, as in the case of the EU or IMF, by officials and regulators who haven't been elected. In many cases, it may well be driven by lobbying from old economy rivals.</p><p>To take one example, the only way for traditional broadcasters to compete against Netflix now might well be to regulate them out of existence. There is a risk here, and a big one. We could do huge damage to the most dynamic part of the global economy by taxing, regulating or breaking up the tech giants now. These are all companies that are still investing on a gargantuan scale. Alphabet, Google's parent, now spends $16bn a year on research. Amazon spent $22bn.</p><p>The top five companies for R&amp;D spending in the US last year were all in tech, throwing $76bn between them at developing new products. There is still a huge amount of innovation ahead, from financial services, to cars, to artificial intelligence, robotics and space. We can tax and regulate that away if we want to. But it would be a huge waste to lose all of those products, and the jobs and wealth they will create, because of issues most of us probably don't really care about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-137019369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6H-T7B1-JBVM-Y3NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 28, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;
