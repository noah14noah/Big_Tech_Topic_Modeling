The administration has since abandoned the policy.</p><p>Microsoft wrote a blog post in January about ICE's use of its cloud technology Azure, saying it could help it \"accelerate facial recognition and identification.\"</p><p>After questions arose about whether Microsoft's technology had been used by ICE agents to carry out the controversial border separations, the company released a statement calling the policy \"cruel\" and \"abusive.\"</p><p>In his post, Smith reiterated Microsoft's opposition to the policy and said he had confirmed its contract with ICE does not include facial recognition technology. </p><p>Amazon has also come under fire from its own shareholders and civil rights groups over local police forces using its face identifying software Rekognition, which can identify up to 100 people in a single photo. </p><p>Some Amazon shareholders coauthored a letter pressuring Amazon to stop selling the technology to the government, saying it was aiding in mass surveillance and posed a threat to privacy rights. </p><p>And Facebook is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit that alleges the social media giant used facial recognition on photos without user permission. Its facial recognition tool scans your photos and suggests you tag friends.</p><p>Neither Amazon nor Facebook immediately responded to a request for comment about Smith's call for new regulations on face ID technology.</p><p>Smith said companies have a responsibility to police their own innovations, control how they are deployed and ensure that they are used in a \"a manner consistent with broadly held societal values.\"</p><p>\"It may seem unusual for a company to ask for government regulation of its products, but there are many markets where thoughtful regulation contributes to a healthier dynamic for consumers and producers alike,\" he said. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Google and Microsoft indicated that they stood by their concerns.</p><p>The EU is intent on passing its new Terrorist Content Regulation, which would empower member states to fine tech firms up to 4pc of their revenue if they persistently fail to scour terrorist material from their services.</p><p>The controversial law has its origins in the global wave of terror attacks that followed the rise of Isis in 2014, during which both Islamic extremists and the far Right were able to exploit social networks and messaging platforms to radicalise, recruit and coordinate. </p><p>Since then, the biggest tech companies have cut their response times, implemented some of the EU's demands and set up a global counter-terror council to share information between. But Brussels believes more can be done, and wants to make sure smaller companies comply.</p><p>European civil rights activists and press freedom groups fear that the law could create an impossible burden for small firms while causing large ones to impose new levels of censorship and surveillance on their users.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Commission said: \"Research shows that one third of all links to Daesh propaganda disseminate within one hour of release... member states most affected by terrorist propaganda have repeatedly called for a one-hour rule.\"</p><p>The consultation responses were published last week by Patrick Breyer, a German MEP who opposes the new law. Though echoing what some companies have said in public, they go much further in their criticism.</p><p>Google said: \"One hour is often not enough time to make a responsible assessment... it creates the wrong incentive by encouraging deletion and speedy decisions over in-depth analysis.\"</p><p>Microsoft said the limit would be \"likely to result in erroneous decisions and the over-removal of content\". Dropbox, Snapchat and the non-profit Internet Archive also argued against the proposal. Facebook did not submit a response.</p><p>A spokesman for Microsoft told the Telegraph: \"In many cases we work diligently to take down terrorist content within an hour or less, and are often able to do so. But in other cases there are trade-offs - for example, when a significant amount of human judgement is required.\"</p><p>But the Commission's spokeswoman dismissed that argument, claiming that there is no need for tech companies to inspect such material themselves because when it has already been thoroughly investigated by the government ordering its removal.</p><p>Giants such as Facebook and Google now routinely use artificial intelligence (AI) to remove terrorist material before any human user can see it, and have formed the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), an industry body that has been hailed by governments but also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/02/17/forcing-tech-giants-take-hate-speech-within-24-hours-could-dangerous/\">criticised as a puppet of Big Tech</url>.</p><p>Tom Drew, who helped build the Home Office's own AI scanners and is now head of counter-terrorism at the British AI firm Faculty, said: \"The structures and technologies in place to detect and remove terrorist content have improved immeasurably... [the industry] can provide expertise and capabilities that in 2017 even the major tech companies were telling the Home Secretary were not possible.\"</p><p>He added that some \"incredibly thorough\" European agencies, including the Metropolitan Police, are already trusted enough that tech firms sometimes accept their requests automatically.</p><p>However, Daphne Keller, an internet law professor and former assistant general counsel of Google, warned that removal orders might not be trustworthy because the list of agencies empowered by the new law is far too broad.</p><p>She said: \"Lawmakers should be clear that what this is is a requirement to do the state's bidding, and the state in this case might be local police in Budapest.

Google, Tesla and Faraday Future are all looking to disrupt the car industry, with Apple widely expected to join them in the coming years.</p><p>Microsoft, however, won't be competing on this level. \"We won't be building our own autonomous vehicle,\" Peggy Johnson, who heads business development for Microsoft, said at the (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-not-building-driverless-car-but-wants-to-help-with-tech-1464932059\">http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-not-building-driverless-car-but-wants-to-help-with-tech-1464932059</url>) Wall Street Journal's Convergence conference in Hong Kong on Friday - though she added \"we would like to enable autonomous vehicles and assisted driving as well.\"</p><p>Johnson spoke about the ability to use Cortana, Microsoft's voice-activated personal assistant, which is available on its desktop and mobile software, in the car, besides leveraging products like the company's Azure cloud computing network, Office 365 suite of apps as well as Windows to improve passengers' experiences.</p><p>Johnson revealed that following a big push at the (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/topic/ces-2016\">http://www.ibtimes.com/topic/ces-2016</url>) Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, the company has held talks with \"about seven or eight different automakers and tier one vendors to the auto community\" as it seeks to push its cloud and software products to become part of the driverless car revolution.</p><p>Johnson confirmed that it may be possible for automakers to partner with Microsoft to create a Windows-based operating system for the increasingly tech-focused cars we will see in the coming years, though it will face stiff competition from Google in this area, with the search giant pouring a huge amount of resources into its own self-driving cars.</p><p>However, given Microsoft's expertise in, and dominance of, the desktop environment, it could have a huge advantage if people turn their cars into moving offices. \"You're sitting in the car for many, many minutes a day,\" Johnson said. \"Can that be part of your new office, can it be your new desk, a place where you actually get work done? We believe it can. Each of [the automakers] had a little something different that they wanted.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he believed fully autonomous vehicles would be ready in two years' time, but that it would take at least another year for regulators to catch up with advances in technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-518478170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 518478170</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5K-1PS1-JCBJ-K0J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 IBT Media, formerly dba International Business Times</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 3, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automobile driving</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automobile industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer software industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Driverless cars</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Motor vehicle driving</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Software industry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

It seems like every week there are reports about another tech company\u00a0working on autonomous\u00a0cars or hinting they might be doing so, which\u00a0is why it is so refreshing to hear Microsoftcategorically ruling itself out of the race. </p><p>While companies like Ford, Toyota and General Motors are all working hard to build their own\u00a0driverless car technology, they are facing competition not\u00a0only from the\u00a0traditional car industry but from the tech industry too.\u00a0Google, Tesla and Faraday Future are all looking to disrupt the car industry with Apple widely expected to join them in the coming years. Microsoft, however, won't be competing on this level.\u00a0'We won't be building our own autonomous vehicle,'\u00a0Peggy Johnson, who heads business development for Microsoft, said at the Wall Street Journal's Convergence conference[1] in Hong Kong on Friday \u2014 though she added\u00a0'we would like to enable autonomous vehicles and assisted driving as well.' Johnson spoke about the ability to use Cortana, Microsoft's voice-activated personal assistant, which is available on its desktop and mobile software, in the car, besides\u00a0leveraging products like the company's Azure cloud computing network, Office 365 suite of apps as well as Windows to improve passengers' experiences. Microsoftsays it won't be competing with Google, Tesla, Faraday Future or Apple by building its own self-driving car. Photo: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Johnson revealed that following a big push at the Consumer Electronics Show[2] in Las Vegas in January, the company has held talks with\u00a0'about seven or eight different automakers and tier one vendors to the auto community' as it seeks to push its cloud and software products to become part of the driverless car revolution. Johnson confirmed that it may be possible for automakers to partner with Microsoftto create a Windows-based operating system for the increasingly tech-focused cars we will see in the coming years, though it will face stiff competition from Googlein this area, with the search giant pouring a huge amount of resources into its own self-driving cars. However, given Microsoft's expertise in,\u00a0and dominance of,\u00a0the desktop environment, it\u00a0could have a huge advantage if people turn their cars into moving offices. 'You're sitting in the car for many, many minutes a day,\" Johnson said.\u00a0\"Can that be part of your new office, can it be your new desk, a place where you actually get work done? We believe it can. Each of [the automakers]\u00a0had a little something different that they wanted.' On Wednesday, Tesla CEO <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>said he believed fully autonomous vehicles would be ready in two years' time, but that it would take at least another year for regulators to catch up with advances in technology.

Amazon Web Services has a cluster of data centres in Bahrain and the UAE.</p><p>Oracle already opened its first data centre in the UAE this year in Abu Dhabi and plans to open one more data centre in the UAE, likely in Dubai, and two in Saudi Arabia by next year while Microsoft opened its data centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi recently.</p><p>Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, has already invested in one data centre in the UAE while SAP opened its data centres in UAE and Saudi Arabia last year.</p><p>In Asia, Goggle has data centres in Singapore, Taiwan and India.</p><p>Manish Ranjan, research firm International Data Corporation&amp;#x2019;s program manager for software and cloud in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, said that looking at the Middle East in isolation, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the biggest spenders on the public cloud services, with growth rates exceeding the market average.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;There are a lot of opportunities for the cloud in the region and Saudi Arabia is the right place for any cloud provider looking to tap into them. Under the Kingdom's proposed data regulations, vendors that have their own in-country data centres would certainly have the upper hand from a compliance and governance standpoint, particularly when it comes to serving the government, healthcare, and banking sectors,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>For the same reason, he added that local telecom operators are better placed than their international counterparts as they are able to deliver software solutions, infrastructure, and development platforms as a service from in-country data centres.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;As such, local telecom operators across the region are investing heavily in local data centres to meet growing cloud demand,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>Rise in public cloud services spending</p><p>Total spending on public cloud services in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) is expected to reach $2.65 billion next year, up from $2.04 billion in 2019.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;Over the longer term, we expect the spending on public cloud services in the region to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.2% for the 2018-2023 period,&amp;#x201D; Ranjan said.</p><p>Another industry expert said that it is high time that Google opens data centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries as the cloud adoption is gaining traction in the region.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;Google needs to have local data centres to cater to governments, financial and banking sectors for data residency regulations and that is why big players have opened data centres in the region,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>According to IDC, the public cloud market in the UAE is expected to grow by 35% to $406m in 2020 compared to $299m this year and two-thirds of the organisations will approach the cloud through a hybrid model.</p><p>The research firm is seeing a decline in on-premise [non-cloud] spending and a lot of spending is moving to the cloud as a subscription-based model to cut costs.</p><p>Google&amp;#x2019;s Khalil said that cloud adoption is gaining in the region and it has 15,000 customers in the Middle East, the biggest regions are in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;We are witnessing the digital transformation of businesses, governments and societies.&amp;#xA0; Part of the transformation is in cloud computing as it provides access to unlimited technology resources.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;At Google Cloud, we have a vision and that is to help our customers on their transformation journey.

But what has been the specific impact on tech use and adoption in a region as diverse as the Middle East?<br/>For some, it's been an opportunity to innovate. For example, in Egypt, 3D printing has been pioneered in the battle to equip doctors and other health workers with personal protective equipment, or PPE.</p><p><br/>Giza Systems Education Foundation (GSEF) announced, via its Facebook page, in early May that it had already provided 27,000 protective face shields to doctors and hospitals across Egypt.<br/>SEE: COVID-19: A guide and checklist for restarting your business (TechRepublic Premium)<br/>In late-April, it told AFP that around 2,000 face shields a day\u00a0are being distributed to medics nationwide, through partnerships with around 25 public and private hospitals.<br/>Elsewhere, technology is being harnessed in myriad ways; from the use of blockchain to track the distribution of food and medicine\u00a0in Bahrain, through to plans for a virtual hospital in UAE, and deployment of a police robot in Tunisia to help enforce a lockdown\u00a0in the nation's capital, Tunis.<br/>However, alongside these eye-catching initiatives, what other consequences and tech developments can be seen across the region?<br/>SIGNATURE PROJECTS DELAYED<br/>One of the most high-profile impacts of COVID-19 has been the delay of Expo 2020 Dubai, a global innovation fair that promises to put technology at its heart.<br/>The event, as\u00a0ZDNet previously reported, is expected to attract 25 million visits, with 70% of visitors coming from outside the UAE. It will now be held from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.<br/>Another big-ticket event for the region, the FIFA 2022 World Cup, is still projected to take place in Qatar as planned.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The promotional video for Expo 2020 Dubai now shows the new 2021/2022 dates. Source: YouTube<br/>In other petro-chemical dependent countries, a combination of falling oil prices and the pandemic have had an inevitable impact on large-scale construction projects, such as the creation of smart cities, which have been seen as key to diversifying the economy for many Gulf nations.<br/>According to the Saudi newspaper Okaz, and reported by Bloomberg, 30 billion riyals ($8bn) has been cut from initiatives designed to deliver help deliver Saudi Arabia's 'Vision 2030'.<br/>Meanwhile, AP suggests that Dubai, which isn't oil and gas-dependent, will once again need to look at the focus of its economy, given the reliance on international workers and trade; both of which are vulnerable to the aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>AIR INDUSTRY<br/>For many people, the region's airlines will be their first major interaction with a Middle East business. They are among some of the best-known and highest-regarded brands in the region\u00a0and around the world. With most flights grounded, airlines have inevitably suffered job losses.<br/>To counteract the impact of the health crisis, some airlines in the region are banking on tech as a way to ensure passenger safety and boost consumer confidence once we start flying again.<br/>Etihad purports to be world's first airline to trial coronavirus technology\u00a0\"which can monitor the temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate of any person using an airport touchpoint such as a check-in or information kiosk, a bag-drop facility, a security point or immigration gate\".<br/>The technology has been developed by Australian company Elenium Automation, which has also worked with Amazon Web Services, to create the touchless self-service devices that Ethihad will also pilot.<br/>These devices, which use voice recognition, potentially allow for a contactless check-in, as airports and airlines seek to reduce the potential for viral or bacterial transmission.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Elenium's contactless check-in was tested by Etihad. Source: Elenium/YouTube\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Launched at a similar time, and with a similar level of fanfare, Emirates proclaimed itself to be the first airline to conduct pre-boarding COVID-19 tests\u00a0for passengers.<br/>Conducted on site at the Dubai International Airport, in coordination with Dubai Health Authority (DHA), blood tests offered results in 10 minutes. However, concerns about reliability and accuracy led to the idea quickly being shelved.<br/>Nonetheless, these two developments offer a strong hint about the future of air travel, and the way tech will shape it more than ever.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Emirates becomes first airline to conduct on-site rapid COVID-19 tests for passengers. Source: Emirates/YouTube \u00a0\u00a0<br/>MESSENGER AND WEB-CHAT SERVICES<br/>In a region where many messenger and web-chat services have long been blocked, Oman's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) agreed \"due to exceptional circumstances\"\u00a0to remove restrictions on tools like Skype, Google Meet and Zoom.<br/>UAE soon followed suit, lifting a ban on Microsoft's Skype for Business and Google Hangouts. It has also made video-calling platform Zoom available, along with Cisco Webex, Avaya Spaces, BlueJeans and Slack, \"on an exceptional basis and until further notice\".<br/>However, WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Skype - but not Skype for Business - \"remain blocked for voice and video calls\",\u00a0CNBC reported at the end of March.<br/>Meanwhile, efforts by the local telecoms provider Du to allow free internet calling via its new app Voico, which launched in late March, met with strong pushback, given that this app is seldom used outside the country.<br/>TECH LEGACY AND FUTURE<br/>With the first wave of the pandemic still running its course, it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be.<br/>There are legitimate concerns about the viability of many smaller businesses - one of the region's sectors that historically has low levels of digital adoption.<br/>Other worries include the spread of rumors and false information online, the use of track-and-trace apps; and whether data-protection laws are fit for purpose - issues far from unique to the region - as well as the impact of the digital divide on telehealth and remote working and schooling.<br/>However, it's likely that the technology clock cannot be turned back.<br/>With the video-call genie out of the bottle, it will be difficult for regulators to revert to the former status quo for platforms that businesses and individuals have been using during the pandemic.<br/>Similarly, as people get used to online education, homeworking and shopping, coupled with use of contactless payments and digital health products, it's likely that some of these digital habits will continue.<br/>\"It's unclear to what extent these new behaviors will continue once lockdowns have been lifted and people are able to socialize in person again,\" notes Simon Kemp, CEO of Kepios and chief analyst at DataReportal.<br/>\"But with many people now using these platforms multiple times each day, it's likely that significant numbers of people have already overcome key barriers to trial and adoption.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1141193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607P-5W91-DYDW-74WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Don't go to Washington looking for a middle market counterpart to the Small Business Administration or the Fortune 500's powerful lobbyists on K Street.</p><p>The middle market universe, broadly defined as companies with annual revenue between $10 million and $1 billion, covers a broad spectrum of industries that include public and privately held companies as well as family-owned businesses, partnerships and sole proprietorships.\u00a0</p><p>Click here to read Q&amp;As with Middle Market 50 companies that made the List:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>EnPhase Energy</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>LiveRamp</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>BCCI Construction</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>While the middle market accounts for only around 3% of U.S. companies, this slice of American business is responsible for one-third of private sector jobs and economic activity, according to the National Center for the Middle Market, located at Ohio State University.\u00a0</p><p>\"Back of the envelope calculations by us show that from the Great Recession to the Great Pandemic, middle market companies accounted for 60% of net new jobs,\" said Thomas Stewart, executive director of the National Center for the Middle Market. \"The middle market is a huge, undercovered area.\"</p><p>The middle market is estimated to employ 30 million people nationwide with combined annual revenue of $10 trillion. Fueling all that growth means middle market companies operate at a robust pace when it comes to hiring, leasing and financing it all. Partially in response to barriers faced by middle market companies, the sector has fostered its own cottage industry of professionals and service providers catering to its financial, accounting and business needs</p><p>A key storyline for the middle market in the current crisis has been the acceleration of digital transformation. Long positioned as an eventual goal, the situation posed by the pandemic has underscored the necessity of a new embrace of technology.\u00a0</p><p>The Bay Area's middle market ranges not only in size and sector but also in how some are thriving and others are diving amid the pandemic. One only needs to take a look at Wall Street for evidence of a clear-cut divide.\u00a0</p><p>DocuSign has seen its shares soar about seven times higher since top-tier bankers Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase took the San Francisco electronic-signature company public in April 2018. DocuSign posted revenue of $701 million in 2019, and the company saw revenue jump to $297 million in the three-month period that ended April 30, 2020 - up almost 40% from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, lesser known Hayward-based Italian wholesale food distributor Armanino Foods of Distinction - with revenue last year of about $43 million - has seen its thinly traded shares fall more than one-third this year. Armanino Foods has trimmed its dividend as it copes with many of its restaurant customers being closed amid shelter-in-place orders.But the company is seeing a recent pickup in sales for its pasta and sauces.</p><p>\"We experienced a steady increase in sales and margins since the lowest point of the pandemic in early April, particularly in the domestic market. This upward trend continued through the end of the quarter,\" Tim Anderson, Armanino Foods' president and CEO, said in announcing second-quarter results. \"The economy, trends and consumer behaviors are still relatively unknown and will take several quarters to truly understand how this pandemic will affect our existing business model going forward.</p><p>\"That being said, we believe we are well positioned financially from a balance sheet perspective to weather the storm and strategically invest,\" Anderson said.</p><p>Both DocuSign and Armanino Foods are examples of how the pandemic-induced economic downturn has spurred middle market companies to set aside initial plans and projections in place before much of the economy shut down as they adapt to the new realities of business. And, they underscore how a divide in strategy can easily separate winners and losers in this market.\u00a0</p><p>\"Covid-19's impact on the economy has been particularly disabling for the middle market, with smaller midsize companies bearing the brunt of the pressure,\" according to accounting firm RSM US LLC, citing a second-quarter survey for its RSM US Middle Market Business Index. \"Smaller middle market businesses sought lending relief at significantly higher rates than their larger counterparts and appeared less able to shift to remote work.\"</p><p>In the National Center for the Middle Market's breakdown of the most important factors for middle market companies to ignite growth, \"investing and innovating\" are listed as key to \"being able to withstand a downturn in your industry.\"\u00a0</p><p>In the research center's parlance, these companies are \"innovators,\" which focus on developing new products and services and processes for delivering them.</p><p>Today's work-from-home environment, in which as much as possible is handled electronically, has fueled DocuSign's business that allows documents to be signed electronically.\u00a0</p><p>Enabling the digital transformation of other companies has been a bright spot for the middle market. Companies like DocuSign and Slack have created the tools and products that are a key enabler of the new way business is conducted due to Covid-19.</p><p>\"DocuSign is in the business of helping customers digitally transform their agreement processes,\" said Kirsten Wolberg, DocuSign's chief technology and operations officer. \"Of our customers, about 60% have been focused on digitally transforming their front-office functions like sales, marketing and customer service. Another 40% of our customers are focused on transforming back-office functions like finance, IT, HR, legal and procurement.\"</p><p>Office closures and working from home amid Covid-19 spurred companies to rapidly embrace digital transformation, adopt new communication tools and shift more operations onto the cloud.</p><p>\"Within DocuSign, we already have the tools for remote collaboration, like Slack and Zoom, and our operations were designed with remote work in mind,\" Wolberg said. \"We also highly leverage our own solutions.\"</p><p>At Zendesk, the pandemic rapidly altered consumer demands and appetites for the San Francisco cloud-based customer service company's products.\u00a0</p><p>\"Covid-19 caused a massive shift across all industries and customer expectations have changed dramatically within a matter of weeks,\" said Colleen Berube, chief information officer and senior vice president of operations at Zendesk.</p><p>The company reoriented its focus to services in greater demand, \"prioritizing the things that have the highest degree of customer impact, and rolling out the tools that are easiest to use and have the capability to deliver results fast,\" Berube said.\u00a0</p><p>That focus on quick results amid the pandemic may explain why the digital transformation of business operations is moving full speed ahead despite economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19, according to a survey of middle market companies by the National Center for the Middle Market.</p><p>An Umpqua Bank survey released this month found more than 80% of middle market companies have already begun automating or plan to automate tasks previously performed by workers.\u00a0</p><p>Other growth channels for the middle market appear to currently be in a lull. On the M&amp;A front, there was a notable deal this month in which private equity firm Thoma Bravo cut an $11 billion cash-and-stock deal to sell Pleasanton fintech Ellie Mae, which provides a cloud-based loan origination platform for the mortgage industry.</p><p>Ellie Mae, which is No. 36 on the San Francisco Business Times Middle Market 50 List, was snapped up by Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Intercontinental Exchange saw its shares change hands at a record price shortly after announcing the Ellie Mae acquisition.</p><p>Such a deal doesn't come as a surprise to Nick Steiner, partner in San Francisco accounting firm BPM. Still, he added that the deal isn't necessarily indicative of the market as a whole.\u00a0</p><p>\"We have had a number of clients get acquired, especially in the technology space. All of the big tech companies, with their stock where they are and all their resources, have been very acquisitive,\" Steiner said. \"We're not seeing a lot of our middle market clients acquiring a lot of other companies. That's been pretty quiet all of 2020.\"</p><p>Today's M&amp;A financing environment is very favorable to the nation's top tech companies, with high stock prices providing a powerful currency for stock-swap deals. Historically low interest rates have\u00a0 also made financing all-cash deals easier.</p><p>Asked why middle market companies aren't out shopping, Steiner said the sector is largely taking a cautious approach.</p><p>\"No one knows what the next six months has in store,\" Steiner said. \"There are a lot of people out there waiting for the other shoe to drop.\"</p><p>But some observers are saying middle market companies are starting to move off the sidelines.</p><p>\"There are trillions of dollars in investment dry powder with corporates and private equities that are constantly searching for deals,\" said Kartik Sundar Raj, a partner with accounting firm RSMUS in San Francisco. \"The middle market has become a rich target.\"</p><p>Others also see the pickup in activity.</p><p>\"M&amp;A activity in the middle market came to a full stop in March and April and now is starting to accelerate rapidly, which is tracking some of the larger company M&amp;A activity that picked up sharply in the last 30 days,\" said longtime San Francisco banker Jon Merriman, who is now chief business officer at B. Riley FBR in Los Angeles.\u00a0</p><p>Merriman said the sector's lack of operational visibility led to the slowdown in deal flow, but executives are getting increasingly comfortable with future projections.</p><p>\"We saw several of our sell side companies take two to three months to calibrate their financials, fully stopping a prospective M&amp;A process, given their uncertainty. That period has normalized,\" Merriman said. \"Given the huge amount of liquidity in the market from the Fed, valuations of private companies are expanding, and obviously the public equity markets have hugely benefited from the massive liquidity.\"</p><p>That liquidity injection into the economy amounting to trillions of dollars also explains why bankruptcy filings are lower than many expected. BPM's Steiner anticipates more bankruptcies ahead by what he calls \"zombie companies.\"</p><p>\"They're sort of in limbo,\" Steiner said of these troubled companies. \"This is where we thought we'd see a bank foreclose or a landlord evict, but we're not seeing any of that. Everything is in a holding pattern. The banks and landlords don't really want to deal with the level of pain this would cause.\"</p><p>While some companies are walking zombies, others are clearly on a roll. In addition to DocuSign, San Francisco-based Slack Technologies also got a lift with more Americans working from home. A point not lost on Wall Street, where the company's shares are up about 65% since mid-March.</p><p>\"Succeeding in this new, remote-first world requires much more than just replicating at home the same processes we once carried out in a physical office - it depends on a fundamental reimagining of work and the employee experience,\" Robby Kwok, senior vice president of people at Slack, said of the opportunity he sees for the company.</p><p>\"It is not just about the tools and technology you work with. It's really about the culture and norms your employees work within, and how you create that culture and propagate those new norms in a work-from-home environment.\"</p><p>Bay Area middle market companies are not only facilitating the digital transformation of other businesses, they're quickly embracing digital in their own operations as Covid-19 forces change in how business is done.\u00a0</p><p>One trend with long-lasting impact is the reliance on communication channels that customers already use in their everyday lives, such as Facebook Messenger, Twitter direct messaging, WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat, among others.</p><p>\"There has been a drive to digital during the crisis, and we can expect when it's over that customers will look to these channels more than ever for engagement as they provide easy and real-time solutions,\" said Zendesk's Berube.</p><p>Invitae, which is focused on bringing genetic information into mainstream medicine, said it turned to telehealth to deliver more of its services in recent months, alongside an AI-based chatbot.</p><p>The San Francisco-based company points to its creation of a chatbot for genetics, named Gia, that combined consumer-facing chatbot technology with a platform for health care providers, all in compliance with health care regulations.</p><p>\"There is one thing we know for sure: Now is the time to break free from outdated notions of how things should be done and to develop a new formula for success,\" Kwok said.\u00a0</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason.</p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence.</p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box.</p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all. They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want some measure of accountability.</p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans have sat on their hands and done nothing about it.</p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying? Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be held accountable.</p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it, right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that. And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that. And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime. So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I`m not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you, which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that. Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump. He joins us tonight.</p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly. If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is what you got?</p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess, I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not being charged with extortion?</p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy?</p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on the Trump team.</p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it?</p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it? We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume your wallet as well.</p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC will finance his travel. That's a little scary too.</p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout. Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND SINGER: So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she tweeted this quote.</p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One, believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet. \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be revealed. Be gentle.\"</p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart. That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on.</p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking their side or very few.</p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know attacked him sexually.</p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\"</p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace and in everyday life.</p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy, to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a 1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants?</p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be imperiling our democracy?</p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us, should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material. Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact, I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of 12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at the moment.</p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be solved at some point.</p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without leaving a paper trail.</p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed, has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation from day one joins us next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do.</p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison.</p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not find any evidence of that.</p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing he has an obligation to follow those leads as well.</p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball. But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying. Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that we've had this week.</p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph) but every -- everybody watching knows what this is.</p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that. But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will, after the break.</p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene. Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out straight ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a biological matter is right. I believe that.</p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators. Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare. But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100 percent preventable.</p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example, you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a really big mess for the environment.</p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look -- that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile, you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I -- I'm not going to put her at risk.</p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're, you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely. And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing. It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to your money, taxpayer money.</p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and hate crimes.</p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous, but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We have no idea what that means. They probably don't either.</p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly what has been happening.</p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as well.</p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here. But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place.</p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14 days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major hurricane landfall in 27 years.</p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently refuse. We hope you will too.</p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p> Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p> The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p> Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p> If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p> There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p> Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p> Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p> Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p> I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p> We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p> SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p> The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p> But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p> SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p> SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p> CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p> SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p> SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p> CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p> SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p> CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p> CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p> CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p> SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p> CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p> SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p> SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p> SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p> CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p> SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p> SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p> CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p> CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p> SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p> SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p> SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p> SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p> SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p> SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p> CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p> (CROSSTALK).</p><p> CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p> SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p> SETZER: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p> SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p> SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p> SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p> SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p> SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p> CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p> SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p> CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p> SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p> SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p> So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p> DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p> Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p> Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p> Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p> CARLSON: I know.</p><p> BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p> BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p> If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p> BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p> But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p> That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p> This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p> CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p> I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p> BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p> BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p> CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p> More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p> \"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p> OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p> Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p> OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p> So due process, I guess --</p><p> CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p> SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p> SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p> I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p> SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p> CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p> SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p> So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p> And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p> But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p> SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p> NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p> Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p> Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p> Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p> ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p> We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p> So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p> I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p> But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p> So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p> CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p> EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p> It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p> So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p> KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p> Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p> But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p> STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p> It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p> It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p> STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p> I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p> CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p> STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p> Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p> In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p> So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p> But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p> LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p> We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p> And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p> CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p> LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p> LANGE: No.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p> LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p> They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p> CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p> LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p> CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p> LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p> LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p> And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p> CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p> LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p> CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p> LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p> CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p> LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p> LANGE: We would.</p><p> CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p> LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p> LANGE: I would.</p><p> CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p> LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p> LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p> CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p> LANGE: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p> LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p> LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p> The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p> Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p> Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p> As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p> The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p> A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p> We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p> STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p> Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p> And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p> They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p> They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p> Tucker, back to you.</p><p> CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p> HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p> HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p> HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p> Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p> Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p> The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p> Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p> If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p> There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p> Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p> Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p> Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p> I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p> We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p> SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p> The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p> But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p> SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p> SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p> CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p> SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p> SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p> CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p> SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p> CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p> CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p> CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p> SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p> CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p> SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p> SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p> SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p> CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p> SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p> SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p> CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p> CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p> SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p> SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p> SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p> SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p> SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p> SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p> CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p> (CROSSTALK).</p><p> CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p> SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p> SETZER: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p> SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p> SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p> SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p> SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p> SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p> CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p> SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p> CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p> SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p> SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p> So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p> DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p> Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p> Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p> Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p> CARLSON: I know.</p><p> BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p> BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p> If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p> BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p> But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p> That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p> This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p> CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p> I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p> BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p> BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p> CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p> More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p> \"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p> OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p> Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p> OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p> So due process, I guess --</p><p> CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p> SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p> SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p> I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p> SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p> CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p> SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p> So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p> And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p> But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p> SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p> NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p> Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p> Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p> Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p> ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p> We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p> So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p> I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p> But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p> So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p> CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p> EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p> It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p> So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p> KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p> Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p> But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p> STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p> It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p> It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p> STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p> I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p> CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p> STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p> Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p> In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p> So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p> But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p> LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p> We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p> And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p> CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p> LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p> LANGE: No.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p> LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p> They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p> CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p> LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p> CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p> LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p> LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p> And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p> CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p> LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p> CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p> LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p> CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p> LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p> LANGE: We would.</p><p> CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p> LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p> LANGE: I would.</p><p> CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p> LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p> LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p> CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p> LANGE: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p> LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p> LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p> The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p> Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p> Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p> As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p> The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p> A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p> We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p> STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p> Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p> And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p> They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p> They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p> Tucker, back to you.</p><p> CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p> HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p> HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p> HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p> Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p> Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p> The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p> Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p> If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p> There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p> Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p> Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p> Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p> I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p> We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p> SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p> The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p> But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p> SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p> SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p> CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p> SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p> SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p> CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p> SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p> CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p> SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p> CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p> SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p> CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p> SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p> CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p> SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p> SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p> SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p> CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p> SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p> SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p> CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p> CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p> SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p> SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p> CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p> SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p> SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p> SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p> SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p> CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p> (CROSSTALK).</p><p> CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p> SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p> SETZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p> SETZER: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p> SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p> SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p> SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p> SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p> SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p> CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p> SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p> CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p> SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p> SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p> CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p> SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p> So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p> DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p> Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p> Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p> Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p> CARLSON: I know.</p><p> BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p> BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p> If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p> BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p> But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p> That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p> This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p> CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p> I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p> BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p> BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p> CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p> More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p> \"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p> OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p> Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p> OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p> So due process, I guess --</p><p> CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p> SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p> SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p> SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p> I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p> SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p> CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p> SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p> So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p> And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p> But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p> SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p> NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p> Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p> Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p> Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p> ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p> We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p> So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p> CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p> I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p> But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p> EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p> So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p> CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p> EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p> It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p> So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p> KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p> Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p> But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p> STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p> It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p> CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p> It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p> STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p> I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p> CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p> STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p> Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p> In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p> So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p> But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p> LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p> We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p> And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p> CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p> LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p> LANGE: No.</p><p> CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p> LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p> They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p> CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p> LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p> CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p> LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p> LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p> And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p> CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p> LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p> CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p> LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p> CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p> LANGE: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p> LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p> LANGE: We would.</p><p> CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p> LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p> CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p> LANGE: I would.</p><p> CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p> LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p> LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p> CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p> LANGE: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p> LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p> LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p> The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p> Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p> Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p> As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p> The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p> A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p> We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p> STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p> Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p> And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p> They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And a lot is at stake and not just on the  policy questions. If Democrats win, and at this point that could definitely  happen, maybe, it's even likely to happen they will immediately try to  impeach the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they claim they're not planning to do that but that's untrue. They've  wanted to impeach Trump since the day he took office. The first crime they  alleged, you'll remember, was collusion with Russia and they claimed  obstruction of justice for firing Jim Comey because firing people in the  federal government is by definition obstruction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After that they fantasized about impeaching the President for the supposed  crime of pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords. Then it was the  immigrant family separation and then it was the Helsinki press conference  with Vladimir Putin, which they told us was treason. </p><p>Now, there's the news, this week that Trump paid off an ex-girlfriend in an  extortion scheme. They're claiming that's impeachable too. No doubt there  will be other high crimes they tell us about in the near future.</p><p>The pretext doesn't really matter, actually. Democrats want to remove Trump  from office because they hate him, that's the reason. If they get their  Congressional majority back they will start that process on day one. They  will have to do that because their base demands that they do that. Look at  the polls. That tells you the whole story.</p><p>Republicans, of course, are horrified by all of this but they shouldn't be  horrified by it. Unlike a Special Counsel Investigation or sabotage by  career federal bureaucrats, impeachment is legitimate. It is a  constitutional process.</p><p>If you think a President has committed high crimes, you impeach him. That's  what the document tells us to do. You put him on trial in Congress. You  present your evidence. You let the Senate decide guilt or innocence. </p><p>There's nothing secretive about it or stealthy. It all takes place in  public. It is totally transparent process. Voters get to decide what they  think and then they render their judgment at the ballot box. </p><p>Last time Congress impeached a President, voters did not like it at all.  They punished the party that did it, the Republicans, in the Mid-term  elections of 1998. That was 20 years ago but Democrats, who have a long  memory, remember it well. And that's why they're lying about their intent  to impeach Trump right now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers act like the thought of impeachment has barely crossed  their minds. \"Impeachment? Really, what?\" It's the same tactic they used  with immigration and so many other issues. Hide their real goals and hope  the country doesn't notice. Well, we have noticed, so let's have an honest  debate about it.</p><p>Joining us now is Christy Setzer. She's President of New Heights  Communications. Christy, thanks for coming on.</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, PRESIDENT, NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS: Glad to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you will concede, I hope, that there's really no, and by the  way, this is not an attack, as I just noted, merely an observation, there's  really no question that Democrats will have to initiate impeachment  proceedings against Trump if they re-take the House?</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure about that. What I do think is that Democrats want  some measure of accountability. </p><p>I think that we've been extremely frustrated to not to put too fine a point  on it by the last 20 months in which no matter what Trump has done, whether  it has been a series of things that most Americans find immoral or un- American or even, at this point, actively criminal behavior, Republicans  have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. </p><p>We've seen hearing after hearing on Hillary's emails but none on, let's  say, to get to the bottom of the Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there has been quite a, I think, I mean I think we've covered  it maybe every night for the last year and a half this Russia  investigation, two of them actually.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: One, initiated by Congress, the other, by the Special Counsel. But  I just don't understand why everyone's so embarrassed of impeachment. That  is the constitutional remedy. It's a political process. It's designed to be  a political process.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest of us can participate in it by voting. Why are we lying?  Why are Democrats lying about impeachment? \"Oh well, we're not really  sure.\" Of course, you're going to impeach him. You should impeach him. If  you think he committed crimes, impeach him. Why is that a scary thing to  say?</p><p>SETZER: Because it's one of many options, right? Right now, we're looking  at a -- of several different ways, I believe, that the President could be  held accountable. </p><p>The biggest one and the most salient one, I think, for most Democrats are  the November elections in which yes, there will be measures to hold the  President accountable if Democrats take back the House and hell, maybe even  -- maybe even the Senate.</p><p>But the other way is judicial accountability. We are now talking about a  president who has potentially committed crimes. He was the unindicted co- conspirator in Michael Cohen's case, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but before I ask you about that crime --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just ask for the third time this question. Why not just  say the most accountable form --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- of accountability is impeachment because it's transparent  unlike the -- the legal proceedings we're watching, certainly unlike the  creepy Special Counsel investigation. There's nothing hidden about  impeachment.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: You present your evidence in public in an open court. Why are  Democratic leaders lying about that? \"Well we're not really sure.\" If you  think he committed crimes, why wouldn't you impeach him?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What is the answer honestly?</p><p>SETZER: I think the answer honestly is that some people have called for  that but the political reality is that he has (ph) 67 votes in the Senate.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the public doesn't like it? Oh, I get it because if there was  public -- if there was broad public support for it then you would do it but  if he's such an obvious criminal why isn't there public support for it?</p><p>SETZER: But the real question is why isn't there Republican support for it,  right? That is the political reality is that there's --</p><p>CARLSON: Well probably because their voters don't want it. That's why.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it's pretty simple. It's a political process.</p><p>SETZER: But why wouldn't they want it given that again the President's --</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know because they disagree --</p><p>SETZER: -- committed a crime --</p><p>CARLSON: -- they disagree with you.</p><p>SETZER: -- more than one federal crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. They -- because they disagree with you. And  disagreement's still allowed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- despite the Left's attempts to criminalize it. We're allowed to  disagree still for this brief moment. So again, my question is if it's so  obvious the President has committed --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- all these crimes, why doesn't the majority of America want him  impeached? I'm confused.</p><p>SETZER: I'm not sure that they don't, to be honest, but again --</p><p>CARLSON: No poll shows that they want that.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the more, again, the more immediate goal for -- for  Democrats should be political accountability and judicial accountability.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you have a political accountability. It's called  impeachment. But you don't want to do it because despite all the carpeting  about how he's a criminal you still haven't convinced the public of that.  And I wonder if that gives you pause. You spend two years telling everyone  that he's a racist and a felon --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but they still don't believe it. Maybe they don't believe you.</p><p>SETZER: I think that the views on actually are changing. If you look at --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- the Democratic base, for example, they actually do want that.  And the majority of --</p><p>CARLSON: I know, exactly.</p><p>SETZER: -- and the majority of independents do as well. But at the same  time, again, I don't think that that should be the only option. I think  it's --</p><p>CARLSON: No. But it's the legitimate one. Isn't it?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Rather than use entrenched career federal bureaucrats to undermine  the President in really the least legitimate possible way, why not just man  up and do it in an honorable Constitution way?</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That's my plea to you. Please do it. But let's get to the crime.  So, you will concede that he was extorted by Stormy Daniels. He paid her  over a 100 grand because he didn't want her to talk. That's extortion. I  think we all would --</p><p>SETZER: I know. That is --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, then why did he pay her --</p><p>SETZER: That is paying off a porn star to keep silent about something that  he --</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that not extortion? If I say I'm going to tell the  public about something bad you did unless you pay me money that's called  extortion.</p><p>SETZER: This is actually a pattern of behavior that Donald Trump has --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- not just with Stormy Daniels but with other women he's slept  with and also --</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but I'm not denying that. Hold on.</p><p>SETZER: -- people in White House.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not -- I'm not denying that.</p><p>SETZER: No, I'm just saying he gives --</p><p>CARLSON: And I don't think he should have paid them. And I think it's  immoral. That's my view.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But paying someone to keep quiet, if I demand that you give me  money in order to be quiet I'm extorting you, and I'm blackmailing you,  which is itself a crime. Why would you support that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- what I don't support is the fact that in Donald Trump's White  House and, I believe, this is unprecedented, he's asked for not just NDAs  from everybody who works there or was on the campaign but also non- disparagement agreements --</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>SETZER: -- which means that nobody who leaves --</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on, you're not answering my question.</p><p>SETZER: No, I am. I'm saying this is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. But --</p><p>SETZER: This is the way he operates.</p><p>CARLSON: -- but he paid her or else she was going to besmirch his  reputation. That's extortion, OK. But where's the crime? I'm totally  missing that. I mean I think you could argue --</p><p>SETZER: I -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- it's immoral to cheat on your wife. You guys don't believe in  marriage so you're not going to argue that. But instead you're arguing it's  a campaign --</p><p>SETZER: I sit here as a married woman, but yes, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean obviously that's the real argument but instead it's a  campaign finance violation? How? It's not.</p><p>SETZER: It is a campaign finance violation. If you are using money from the  campaign to pay off this woman, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. That's a crime right there.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But that's not what he's accused of doing. He's not accused of  using campaign donations to pay her off, is he, because that would be a  crime?</p><p>SETZER: I believe he is. And that's why he said no, no, no, I used campaign  money --</p><p>CARLSON: No because that's a flat --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>CARLSON: -- I mean, look, if I'm wrong --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- I will definitely stand corrected.</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I will not defend that by the way because that would be a  flat-out crime and people go to jail for that. My impression is it's his  money. That's nothing to do with the campaign.</p><p>SETZER: I think that is what he said although the story, as you know, has  changed quite a bit from I didn't know anything about it to I learned about  --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So let me -- my -- my producers who were on this say --</p><p>SETZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There was no evidence that he used campaign funds. Again, that  would be a crime and I would be the first to say he should be prosecuted  for that.</p><p>SETZER: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: But no one's lashing out (ph). So, why is it a crime to accede to  an extortion demand? I'm totally honestly confused.</p><p>SETZER: The reason why we have been -- that people have been very exercised  about this is because this happened at a really suspicious time, right? It  happened October before the election, so a couple weeks, let's say, right  after the Access Hollywood tape had come out and it truly, truly damaged  his candidacy to the point of people wondering if he was actually going to  have to drop out or something, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he won anyway right?</p><p>SETZER: So, it was going to be coming out potentially at the same time he  wanted to make sure it didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So -- OK, so --</p><p>SETZER: So that is what it is.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you're saying that if people had found out --</p><p>SETZER: And its influence that lacked it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- that Donald Trump might have committed adultery something he  bragged about in Howard Stern multiple times that they wouldn't have voted  for him even after they saw the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged  about his low sexual standards so like actually what you're saying doesn't  make any sense at all.</p><p>SETZER: That's actually the case though is that his ratings, his approval  ratings dropped significantly. His polling dropped significantly --</p><p>CARLSON: So when Bill Clinton paid off --</p><p>SETZER: -- after the Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>CARLSON: -- during the 1996 campaign Monica Lewinsky with a job when he  sent her over to Bill Richardson for job, paid her off for her silence that  wasn't a campaign finance violation but this President paying off his  girlfriend is?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that Bill Clinton was extensively investigated. He was  impeached. He was, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He -- well, oh no, no, he definitely was. He was definitely  impeached. He shouldn't have been. I agree. But he wasn't charged with a  campaign finance violation, why is that?</p><p>SETZER: I -- I think that they're apples and oranges. The fact is --</p><p>CARLSON: OK. They're apples and oranges. I'm calling apples on that.  Christy, I hope you impeach him so we can just have an honest conversation  about it.</p><p>SETZER: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service agent, NRATV  Contributor, Author of Spygate, the attempted sabotage of Donald J. Trump.  He joins us tonight. </p><p>So Dan, I'm probably the only right-of-center person in America who would  welcome an impeachment trial because I'm sick of all of these efforts  taking place sub-rosa, hidden. We don't know exactly what's going on. I  would welcome an open conversation of what the alleged crimes are. Why  don't we have an impeachment trial and just get this over with?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Because the Democrats don't want it  right now because they would get absolutely smoked in the Senate. Christy's  right. 67 votes, you'd be lucky to get 40 votes on that. The American  public would be furious as they learned from the Clinton operation.</p><p>Tucker, the American people in the Clinton impeachment trial spoke loudly.  If you are going to overturn a duly elected president, his results in  winning an election, you damn well better bring the goods. What do they  have now, Tucker? Taxicab medallions and National Enquirer stories? This is  what you got? </p><p>Bob -- Bob -- this is what you have right now? We've been told for a year  and a half as you slam the emergency brake on the entire country's  operations that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win an election  and you bring us the National Enquirer, a Manafort guy who didn't pay his  taxes allegedly years before he met Trump and you bring us a taxicab  medallion case. This is the best you've got?</p><p>Tucker, wait, one more thing too. With all due respect you probably guess,  I know she's very nice of them (ph) but she doesn't even have basic facts  of the case right. Donald Trump was not accused of paying with campaign  funds. It was personal funds.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BONGINO: That's kind of a big deal before you go on the air and start  calling for accountability. You don't even know the facts in the case. Give  me a break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I was confused by that because --</p><p>BONGINO: -- I want to do this all (ph) the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, of course, campaign funds, Jesse Jackson Jr. went to  prison for that. Lots of people have gone to prison for that but that's not  the allegation. I'm a little confused though, why is Stormy Daniels not  being charged with extortion? </p><p>If somebody came to me and said \"I'm going to destroy your reputation  unless you pay me money\" I'd call the cops immediately, immediately even if  I did it. I mean of course because that's extortion. But nobody mentions  that she blackmailed the guy. I mean he went along with it. But she still  blackmailed him. Why is that not an issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well if Donald Trump was a Democrat it would be an issue. It'd be  on the front page in The Washington Post. They'd be attacking her  credibility just like they attacked Ken Starr. Remember that doozy? </p><p>But what I find fascinating about this too, Tucker, you just had a Democrat  guest who's a strategist talking about, again, accountability, talking  about this specific payment, and yet, they completely ignore the fact that  the Clinton team actually paid, Tucker, with real campaign funds, a law  firm that then declared legal services, declared the payment as legal  services, and used the money to go fire -- hire a foreign agent to spy on  the Trump team. </p><p>That was done with actual campaign funds to put together a fake dossier but  nobody seems to care. They're worried about Donald Trump and -- and Daniel  Stormy or Stormy whatever her face is. I mean this is it? </p><p>This is -- this is why we've slammed the brakes on the country for a year  and a half. This is the best you could -- this is like the biggest joke in  American history. Unfortunately, the joke's on us.</p><p>CARLSON: The ruling class hates populism above all. And I think and I got - - we're out of time. But I just got to say I hope that we can talk about  this off-camera but at some point we need to re-assess what happened to  John Edwards. </p><p>I always thought he was kind of a sleaze. But they got him. They tried to  send him to prison for paying off a girlfriend. Why is it? Because he  wasn't actually Liberal, he was a populist. And that's the thing they hate  most, I think.</p><p>BONGINO: Maybe they -- (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway, Dan, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir. Again (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've heard endlessly for, I don't know, a couple years now  about the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. But if you're looking  for threats to our democracy how about Silicon Valley which could change  the course of our election instantly without any of us knowing about it?  We're going to speak to the most knowledgeable person in the world on this  question next and it will curl your hair. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We know the creepy porn lawyer can suck a person's soul through a  television screen. That's bad enough but he wants more. He wants to consume  your wallet as well. </p><p>CPL has created his own Political Action Committee called Fight PAC to  support his inevitable run for president. Creepy porn lawyer says his PAC  will finance his travel. That's a little scary too. </p><p>More travel means it's easier than ever for him to sneak into your local  television station, even your basement, remain in the (ph) lookout.  Whatever you do not donate will only make him more aggressive just like in  Yellowstone (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, AMERICAN ACTIVIST, FORMER ACTRESS, AUTHOR, MODEL, AND  SINGER:  So many people accusing Hollywood right-wingers especially of being fake  and hypocrites, they're not wrong. We just have to stop the rot at the top  because it affects everything. And if we can get rid of that rot we can be  a free society and a better society and I know this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know this. That was actress and noted moral voice, Rose  McGowan, the Harvey Weinstein accuser, one of the leaders of the Me Too  Movement. Last year she downplayed the important of due process, she  tweeted this quote. </p><p>\"It is quite simple,\" everything in Hollywood is quite simple, \"All who  have worked with known predators should do three simple things. One,  believe survivors. Two, apologize for putting your careers and wallets  before what was right. Three, grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do  these things you are still moral cowards.\"</p><p>OK. So she drew a line in the sand. And then this. Fellow Harvard Weinstein  accuser Asia Argento has been accused of paying off a man she is accused of  sexually assaulting when he was underage.</p><p>Now, McGowan is saying something very different. Here's her new tweet.  \"None of us know the truth of the situation. And I'm sure more will be  revealed. Be gentle.\" </p><p>OK. Christina Hoff Sommers is an Author. She works the American Enterprise  Institute. She hosts the podcast, The Femsplainers. She's very smart.  That's why she's joining us tonight. Christina, thanks off for coming on. </p><p>So due process, I guess --</p><p>CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR: Thank you  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: -- looks a little more appealing when you're on the receiving end  of mob justice, doesn't it?</p><p>SOMMERS: Yes. Due process for me but not for thee, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: We need a little consistency or it looks like hypocrisy and  cronyism.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier just to stipulate as the framers did that  everybody gets due process, even the obviously guilty, even the people who  say \"Come on. He did it?\" There's a reason that we go through all these  steps. It's not just Kabuki. I mean there's an actual principle worth  preserving. Why does nobody say that?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well somehow in the -- all of the excitement around the Me Too  Movement we sort of lost sight of that. And it became -- it came to a  moment where it was so -- so guilty because accused and a lot of people  without evidence had their reputations ruined. Now, there are people that  are guilty of serious harassment --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, for sure.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- and sexual predation, and we have to make them accountable. But  it just turns out that some of the guilty include women.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I think most of us understand intuitively that most people  accused not just of harassment but of anything probably guilty, but not  all. Some are innocent. And it used to be that --</p><p>SOMMERS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: -- Liberals reminded us \"Oh, I've been accused of something I  didn't do.\" So I -- I know that for a fact Liberals used to remind us of  that. And those of us on the Right would say \"Oh, they're all guilty\" but  they're not actually all guilty. Where is the Left now reminding us that  due process and civil rights are real, they're very important?</p><p>SOMMERS: Well it -- that whole idea of due process has been lost on the  college campus where we've had now by now hundreds of cases of young men  who were subject to kangaroo court justice and there was just no one taking  their side or very few. </p><p>I mean there've been those of us out on the outside and groups like FIRE  who've been making a plea for -- for due process. And I actually agree with  Rose McGowan that we should proceed with care in all cases.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SOMMERS: I just wish that she'd apply that -- that consistently.</p><p>CARLSON: Has the fever passed, do you think?</p><p>SOMMERS: I think that the -- the -- these revelations about Asia Argento  and there's also a professor at NYU, a luminary, a feminist luminary  scholar, female --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- who has been found guilty of harassing a young male graduate  student. For years, she stalked him and you know was texting. She was  obsessed with him. And there's some evidence that she actually you know  attacked him sexually. </p><p>So, this -- this changes a little bit the focus because this idea, believe  women, you know well maybe you should -- we should, I don't think anybody  really -- deserves you know to be absolutely believed until we examine the  evidence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: But every victim should be taken seriously and treated with  dignity whether it's a man or a woman. And in the case of this NYU  professor, Avital Ronell, the young man that accused her, a group of famous  feminist scholars just sort of gathered round and wrote a letter and said  \"Oh, well he's a liar. And you know she's such an important dignified  feminist professor, how can we take him seriously?\" </p><p>And it was astonishing to the academic community to see this kind of  hypocrisy. So, I think -- I do believe in the Me Too Movement. I think that  it's an occasion you know where there's just more consciousness about the  need for more dignity and respect between men and women in the workplace  and in everyday life. </p><p>But it has to be something that men and women do together and it shouldn't  be that we -- we treat men as the enemy and that you know it's we look at  harassment as something only men do. This is a human undertaking and I --</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOMMERS: -- I hope that this -- these revelations about these women  harassers and predators will help us to see to see that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm certainly not (ph) taking any more lectures from Rose  McGowan. I've decided. I'm starting now. Christina Hoff Sommers, thank you  very much. Good to see you.</p><p>SOMMERS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We've heard a ton endlessly really about Russia's threat to  democracy but very little about the much greater threat to our democracy,  to our elections, to self-government from Silicon Valley. That is real and  our analysis of it is just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've almost certainly heard it once or twice or perhaps a  1001 times, Russia is an existential threat to American democracy. Maybe  the single dumbest talking point of all time but it's an article of faith  in the Democratic Party and so it's repeated robotically by their servants  in the media. Here's an example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Our democracy is at risk. Russia  attacked our elections.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Russians are equal-opportunity malevolent  actors.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin's Russia will stop interfering in American  politics, in American elections when we stop him.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The one person he hasn't blamed is the  man who's actually responsible, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>NANCY PATRICIA D'ALESANDRO PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: The Russians are once  again waging a campaign to interfere in our elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, the whole topic is like an IQ test and you just saw some of  the kids who failed. But how about this? If a few Russians buying Facebook  ads threatens our democracy, and that's what they're telling us, how about  the threat of Facebook itself or other tech giants? </p><p>Representatives from about a dozen tech companies, including Facebook and  Twitter, held a secret meeting today ostensibly to discuss how to resist  the manipulations of these platforms. But could it be that these companies  themselves are manipulative? Could they, and not the Russians, be  imperiling our democracy? </p><p>Nobody has studied this more carefully than Robert Epstein. He's a Senior  Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  he joins us tonight.</p><p>Dr. Epstein, thanks very much for joining us. I just want to say at the  outset I've no idea what your politics are. I don't think you're a  conservative. I don't think it matters. You care about democracy. Tell us,  should we be concerned potentially about the manipulation of our democracy  by the tech companies?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: Tucker, it's great to be back. I am not a  conservative. And we should be extremely concerned because I can tell you  the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the  filtering and ordering of content, and that is completely in the hands of  Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen? I know that you've gamed this out to some  large extent. How would a company, you're not accusing with this, but  potentially, how would a company like Facebook or Google manipulate public  opinion to achieve a desired result in an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think they're doing this all the time actually because  we're well aware of the fact that they -- they suppress material.  Sometimes, they announce it. Sometimes, they don't.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that Google puts some items higher in search  results than other items. Well if search results favor one candidate that  shifts votes. I think we're well aware of the fact that news feeds on  Facebook sometimes seem to favor one political point of view over another  and that shifts votes.</p><p>So, I may have an article coming out very soon about 10 different ways that  these big tech companies can shift millions of votes in November. In fact,  I calculate this November they'll be able to shift upward of -- upwards of  12 million votes just in the Mid-term elections.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean if they have the power to do that and they have a  demonstrated political preference and a demonstrated willingness to  exercise that preference by suppressing information they disagree with, as  we both have seen, then why shouldn't we be terrified that they're going to  subvert our democracy completely?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I think democracy has been subverted actually because at the  moment you see there are no specific rules or regulations that are stopping  these companies from exercising the power that they have, so that's a  problem. Another problem is that we have no monitoring systems in place at  the moment. </p><p>I'm working with academics and with business people to build monitoring  systems but until those systems are fully in place you can't even really  track what it is they're doing, what it is they're showing people, so we've  got some big problems here at the moment. I think the problems can be  solved at some point. </p><p>But, at the moment, I think democracy is in trouble.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans don't want to do anything because they're free  market absolutists under the narcotic sway of libertarian religion and  Democrats don't want to do anything because they know what helps them. But  without Congress acting, would anybody trust our electoral system as honest  and on the up and up?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I wouldn't trust it at the moment because you know in the  research I do, you know, I found number one that it's very easy to shift a  lot of votes without people knowing that they're being influenced, so  that's a problem. And the other problem is that you can do this without  leaving a paper trail. </p><p>So, at the moment, I think we're -- we're really in deep trouble. And I  think you -- you hit the nail on the head. The Republican -- Republicans  aren't doing anything about it. The Democrats aren't doing anything about  it, each for their own reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: It's -- it's terrifying. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for calling  attention to this. You're one of the only people who have asked and we  appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Robert Mueller's hunt for Russian collusion, you may have noticed,  has turned into a permanent one-sided fishing expedition in which people's  lives are being destroyed for no good reason. Why is it continuing? Is  there a justification for that? Someone who's tracked the investigation  from day one joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the Special Counsel Investigation headed by Robert Mueller  was created, you will remember, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016  election. Didn't take much time to deduce there was very little to  investigate there but the investigation didn't go away. They never do. </p><p>It broadened over and over until it became what it is now which is a team  of Democratic attorneys prying into the personal lives of anyone associated  with Donald Trump and sending some of them to prison. </p><p>So, what justifies the continued existence of this investigation, which is  a good question if you ask Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal does  though, and she joins us tonight? So, Kim what is the pretext for  continuing this at this stage?</p><p>KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Well it's hard  to know. Again, we were supposed to talk about Trump-Russia collusion. So  far, in all of the time that the Special Counsel has gone along, he has not  find any evidence of that. </p><p>Now, his mandate did say any related crimes, so I guess if you were going  to give him a rationale you could say if you found evidence of wrongdoing  he has an obligation to follow those leads as well. </p><p>But I think one of the frustrations out there among a lot of people who are  watching this is that you now have this very one-sided probe where all the  people who were accused of things, or not necessarily found guilty of any  of those accusations, are still under the spotlight whereas those who made  the accusations and potentially have done some criminal activity of their  own are getting no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean look, I'm not defending Michael Cohen who I just want  to say, for the record, I've always thought was a ridiculous sleazeball.  But if at the end we find out that he didn't pay taxes on the sale of a  handbag and like brokered a deal to a porn star, I mean that's not really  worth ending the business of government for two years, is it? Is anyone  going to admit that?</p><p>STRASSEL: No, because they're so invested in this point in legitimizing and  rationalize. Look, ask yourself this question which is somewhat mystifying.  Michael Cohen has been brought up on two felony charges of breaking  campaign finance laws. I've written about campaign finance laws a lot. It  is exceptionally rare that they ever prosecuted at a criminal level. They  are almost --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- always civil charges. So, why did they do it? They did it so  that they could have a connection with Trump and all the headlines that  we've had this week. </p><p>It's the only thing that I can think of for why they would have gone down  that path especially because we read that they had close to 20 charges that  they wanted to bring again (ph) and they dropped a number of them just so  that they could get the few that they got on taxes and banks and -- and the  campaign finance violations.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean how de-stabilizing is this for the country? I mean if  you find that the President's colluding with Vladimir Putin, you know, bust  him for it. But if people come away thinking this is upon both sides (ph)  but every -- everybody watching knows what this is. </p><p>It's a bunch of people who hate Trump are trying to bring him down by any  means necessary. But when the smoke clears does anyone trust the justice  system at all anymore?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well no. And here's one of the problems is look, I think a lot of  Americans when Bob Mueller was first of a -- put in place thought \"All  right, get to the bottom of this very serious accusation.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STRASSEL: Was there Trump-Russia collusion?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STRASSEL: Look that -- that was a big deal. We deserved an answer to that.  But if you're now going to go down the line of prosecuting all these other  things and then you're not even going to take a look at the people who may  have done wrong in making these accusations and lodging that very serious  accusation at the top echelons of our government where it was acted upon by  the FBI.</p><p>I mean look, if you're going to go after Michael Cohen for campaign finance  violations, why is nobody taking a look at the Hillary Clinton campaign or  the DNC who hired an opposition research firm but did not state that  accurately on their campaign finance forms? They ran it through a law firm  and called it legal services.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it just makes everybody so cynical. It just degrades the  country in a way that's going to be hard to recover from. It's very sad to  watch. You are one of the clearest explainers of what's going on, Kim  Strassel, and we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well America has seen two alligator attacks in a single week. One  of them killed a woman. Why are we putting up with these carnivorous  reptiles living in our midst? That's a question worth asking and we will,  after the break. </p><p>Also Hurricane Lane is headed for Hawaii. Steve Harrigan is on the scene.  Is he strapped to something strong or will he blow away, we will find out  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: A woman in South Carolina has become the latest victim of a  crocodile attack -- alligator attack. Kindergarten teacher Cassandra Cline  was dragged away and killed while walking her head on -- her dog rather in  Hilton Head Island. Attacks like this are uncommon still but they are  growing in frequency.</p><p>In Florida alone, 24 people have been killed by Gators since 1948. But of  those 24, 14 occurred in the past 20 years. Non-fatal attacks have risen  dramatically as well. Lisa Lange is Senior Vice President of PETA, and she  joins us tonight. </p><p>So Lisa, I know what you're going to say and I hate to put words in your  mouth. But you're going to say that the Gator attacks or the fall of people  because they're too close to Gators and that you know probably as a  biological matter is right. I believe that. </p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that people are more valuable than Gators.  Gators are highly unattractive pre-historic carnivorous reptiles so why do  we put up with this?</p><p>LISA LANGE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETA: Well yes, I mean  there's a lot of human encroachment and pollution but still --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- you have to answer the question well what do we do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: And after this tragic incident this week in South Carolina, it's  important to know, as you said, that these incidents are exceedingly rare.  But I think what's especially tragic about this too is that it's a 100  percent preventable. </p><p>We're seeing a number of problems in this age of social media, for example,  you may -- you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that a big  problem is people feeding alligators and people are doing that with  alligators and other wildlife for the perfect selfie or to be able to put  up a YouTube -- a YouTube video.</p><p>And what that does is not only endanger the person who's doing the feeding  but of course it gets these animals more used to interaction with human  beings, which is dangerous for the next person down the line --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK, but -- but --</p><p>LANGE: -- and then the animal, of course, loses their life.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I get it. And -- and look, I love animal -- really love  animals and I support, I think PETA's a little lunatic but I actually kind  of support some of the things you do because I love animals that much. But  these are disgusting reptiles. You're blaming the victim. I mean feeding an  alligator should not be a death-penalty offense.</p><p>LANGE: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot the alligators? Why is that so  bad?</p><p>LANGE: Well, yes. Well they're an important part of the ecosystem. And  anytime we jump in and we start to kill predators or animals we don't like  because they look different from us or they're pre-historic looking, it's a  really big mess for the environment. </p><p>They control rodent populations. They control nutria populations. It's a  bad idea. It's a bad idea for the ecosystem and it's a bad idea ethically  but and it's, you know, back to whose fault is this, I doubt very highly  that this woman knew what the risks were. There's no way she would have  walked that --</p><p>CARLSON: I mean she --</p><p>LANGE: -- closely had she known.</p><p>CARLSON: -- because the alligator went after her dog. And that's look --  that's look --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- you represent PETA. You're pro-animal, so am I.</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There is if you have to make a call between a dog and a reptile,  you're got to choose the dog. Let's put up on the screen. This is a Gila  monster, OK, I don't know if you can see this. Oh there's a Springer  Spaniel, the most noble of all dogs. If that is going to be killed by a  Gila monster or a pit viper, a Komodo dragon --</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- or some disgusting reptile, there's the Gila monster right  there, you shoot the reptile because there is a hierarchy of animals. Can  you concede that they're not all the same? A housefly is not the same as a  Golden Retriever.</p><p>LANGE: Well no, absolutely. And my dog, of course, means more to me than my  neighbor's dog. And I understand that. But I'm also an outdoors person. I  backpack. I trail run.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, me too.</p><p>LANGE: I know there are certain seasons where I can't take my dog with me  because of rattlesnakes or I know that there's a certain area where there  are mountain lions near where I live, so I don't take her because I know  that that's -- if I'm going to put myself at risk that's one thing but I --  I'm not going to put her at risk. </p><p>And there are just certain things like were there signs here that she could  see? There are where I trail run there are constant reminders that we're,  you know, there are -- there's wildlife there that we have to be careful  of. I don't know if they were there to warn her --</p><p>CARLSON: But what about the little kid who got dragged out into the pond at  Disney World in Florida?</p><p>LANGE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CARLSON: Like you're not going to blame him, so like --</p><p>LANGE: No, no, I mean it's never the victims.</p><p>CARLSON: -- why would we just go through and kill every alligator?</p><p>LANGE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean really are we going to miss --</p><p>LANGE: Oh, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And let's be totally honest here, we're not going to miss the  alligators. They make awesome luggage.</p><p>LANGE: We would.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not -- I wouldn't at all.</p><p>LANGE: No, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: And I love animals.</p><p>LANGE: I would.</p><p>CARLSON: You'd miss the alligators?</p><p>LANGE: I would. I would miss them and the ecos -- and the yes, absolutely.  And the ecosystem would miss them. They're here for a reason. Any -- if you  don't -- even if you don't feel warm and cuddly about them they do serve a  purpose and to kill them unless you kill all of them, which no one is a  proponent of --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LANGE: -- then you they -- they will make up the numbers. They will adjust  this their --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I don't know. I might be. We're out of time.</p><p>LANGE: -- the number of babies. They do.</p><p>CARLSON: You'll have to come back to finish conversation but I might be a  proponent of that.</p><p>LANGE: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p>LANGE: No, you're not (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But as long as you're on the side of dogs, I'm on your side. Lisa  Lange, thank you very much.</p><p>LANGE: OK. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hurricane Lane is on track for Hawaii. We're hoping conditions  allow Steve Harrigan to get his shot up for us taking a risk being there at  this time. We're going to check in with him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We have an update in our ongoing investigation into collaboration  between the federal government, your federal government, and the Southern  Poverty Law Center, the fake civil rights group.</p><p>The SPLC is basically an adjunct of the Democratic Party's activist wing.  It exists only to tar the Democratic Party's enemies as \"hate groups\" and  destroy them. Now we know they've been able to do that in part, thanks to  your money, taxpayer money. </p><p>Our investigation of U.S. spending data reveal that the Department of  Homeland Security paid the Southern Poverty Law Center about $4,500 a  decade ago for \"educational support as well as a training course\" bias and  hate crimes. </p><p>Fortunately, a DHS spokesman told our program they no longer use the SPLC  for training purposes and haven't done that since 2008. We're glad to hear  that. You should be too.</p><p>As for the FBI though, the bureau previously told us they have a  \"relationship\" with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is outrageous,  but denied to us today that they have a \"partnership\" with the SPLC. We  have no idea what that means. They probably don't either. </p><p>The bureau has called the SPLC \"credible\" and allowed it to brief FBI  agents who are armed and can arrest you. We've repeatedly asked the FBI to  tell us the truth to clarify its current relationship with the SPLC. They  act like there's nothing to explain in the first place, which is dishonest  and infuriating.</p><p>A spokeswoman told us \"We welcome information from any organization or  individual regarding any potential crimes or threats.\" In other words, the  FBI still won't clarify whether it works with the SPLC still. We know they  have. Do they still? They won't answer. We'll keep after them until they  do.</p><p>We've got a Fox News alert for you. Hurricane Lane is hitting parts of  Hawaii at the moment. Steve Harrigan, the bravest man in television is on  Waikiki Beach. Steve, how is it there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, it certainly doesn't feel  like a Category 1 hurricane is bearing down on Honolulu but that's exactly  what has been happening. </p><p>Much of the state has already felt the pain. The Big Island has been hit by  more than three feet of rain in some places, washing out roads, causing  some landslides. A number of home rescues have had to be carried out as  well. </p><p>And that trouble is slowly coming north this way as well. It's a slow- moving storm, just about 5 miles an hour and it's dumping rain wherever it  goes. It was originally a Category 5 storm with very powerful winds. It's  down to a 1 now but it's not going to be the wind, it's going to be the  rain.</p><p>They've been closing everything in sight, schools, government offices, even  some flights canceled on different parts of the island. Shelters have  opened up across the island as well, about a 1,000 people in shelters here.  But officials are warning people to try and shelter in place. </p><p>They've told people to try and have enough food and water for the next 14  days, which is certainly a tall order in a state which hasn't had a major  hurricane landfall in 27 years. </p><p>Tucker, back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve, have you told the people behind you? They seem kind of  unconcerned on Oahu tonight.</p><p>HARRIGAN: It's very calm Hawaiian atmosphere.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Despite the danger probably about eight or 10 hours away, we  could see some flash flooding and some road closures but you see children  in the water right now. The police have tried to bring those surfers in but  surfers somehow just not listening to the police today, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Harrigan who's been in some very hairy situations over the  years. Be safe Steve, thank you.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And God bless the people of Hawaii. Good luck. That's right and  stay tuned (ph) every night 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And we mean it. That's not just  a talking point. There's a lot of pressure to conform and we consistently  refuse. We hope you will too. </p><p>Judge Jeanine hosting Hannity, next. Have the best weekend. We'll see you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And if you're a renter, forget about it. You'll pay thousands a month for a part-time share in a studio apartment. But that's not the housing crisis we're talking about. </p><p>The more concerning one is the homelessness problem in California and around the world. However, that's not a very sexy topic so let's split the difference. Mighty Buildings is a company that might just be able to directly address both. Mighty Buildings is a startup that just came out of stealth to 3D-print homes. They're not the first company in the mix[1] and there's no super-fancy tech gimmick at play here (nobody's promising you free housing in exchange for your data or some crap like that). [embedded content] The company emerged last month after raising $30M in venture capital from YCombinator and others. What's most interesting about Mighty Buildings offerings is that they can be built to custom specifications, up to code in California, incredibly quickly. And they've also created novel printing techniques and automated as much as 80 percent of the production. [embedded content] [embedded content] According to the company's website[2], prices start around $100K for an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, studio-sized apartment. Sam Ruben, Mighty Buildings' Co-Founder and Chief Sustainability Officer, told TNW that demand for the product was high already: We are actually seeing increasing interest for our offerings now that we have launched out of stealth. We stayed in stealth as long as we did to focus on our R&amp;#38;D to get to the point where we felt we could live up to the excitement &amp;#38; hype that our technology has understandably created. It also allowed us to focus on the regulatory side of the equation to make sure that we were in a place where our units can be delivered anywhere in California and easily translated to other states. But again, this seems like a great solution for big tech companies looking to plop down a bunch of units to solve their highly-paid employees' housing problems. What about the greater good? We asked Ruben why the government wasn't pouring money into companies like theirs. After all, fighting homelessness is supposed to be a top priority for California and the world at-large and this seems like a tailor-made solution. Unfortunately the wheels of government move slowly. Ruben explained: There are definitely grant programs such as SBIR and other government programs to support these type of solutions. However, in many cases the funding cycles can be slow and depending on the grant there can be limitations to how it is spent, IP implications, and other issues that led us to decide that in our case we were better served going the route of being venture backed in order to achieve our challenging goals. By going the route we did, we were able to go from a tabletop printer to fully-permitted units in 2.5 years with our first units delivered to customers in less than 3. Mighty Buildings has already delivered two fully-functional units and is working on filling numerous orders. We reached out to Governor's office to see if the state was investigating 3D-printed buildings as a potential means to address the homelessness problem in California now that there's a fully-permitted option available, but didn't receive an immediate response.

Immigration is the ultimate moral litmus test. When a Caravan of poor migrants from the third-world shows up, uninvited on your doorstep, the decent among us step forward to welcome them in. That's commanded by the moral code of cable news and, more importantly, by the poem at the bottom of the Statue of Liberty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only bigots and haters slam the door. That's what (ph) they've been telling us in the media now for years. CNN's Jim Acosta has made that point repeatedly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, it has finally happened. The Caravan has arrived. But here's the funny part. It didn't arrive in our country. It arrived in Mexico, in the border city of Tijuana, just across the fence from San Diego. The people of Tijuana are Mexican citizens.</p><p>So, by definition, they are good people, much better than you are. They're more welcoming and compassionate, less selfish and less American. They must be thrilled by the new arrivals. As immigrants, their new Honduran neighbors will grow their economy and add rich new diversity to their culture. That's what low-skilled immigrants always do, again, a point that Jim Acosta frequently makes.</p><p>So are the people of Tijuana grateful for this Caravan from Honduras? Fox's William La Jeunesse went there to find out firsthand. Here's what he discovered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Should this Caravan had (ph) been stopped at the Guatemala border?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, I agree with that 100 percent, it should have.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your country has to beware of -- of these people because they are people -- they are bad people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Because they don't belong here. They're just migrants but it's like the same -- in the same case, it's like when Mexican migrants going to the U.S., they're undocumented.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do know of incidences here in Tijuana and in other cities that some of these people that are coming into these -- with these Caravans are committing crimes.</p><p>This is not about racism. We don't dislike a certain group of people because they're from a country, one country or another. We are here because our government has not taken control of these, what we call invasions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Whoa! Wait a second. That's not the script we expected at all. The migrants are disruptive. They \"Don't belong here.\"</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTING)</p><p>CARLSON: Some of them are criminals. It sounds like what they're saying in Tijuana is when Honduras sends its people, it's not sending their best, and that's a racist statement, obviously.</p><p>We know that because Donald Trump said something like that about Mexico once, and the geniuses on cable news never forgot it. They're still talking about that line years later as evidence of Trump's White supremacy.</p><p>And yet, here you have non-White people in Mexico saying pretty much exactly the same thing. How can that be? Let's check back with Tijuana to make sure we heard that right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Donald Trump was right. This was an invasion. What Donald Trump said was true. This is an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Donald Trump was right? Wait. How can someone in Mexico say that? Everybody in Mexico hates Trump. He believes in borders. Nobody in Mexico believes in borders. They're better than that.</p><p>Well maybe that was just a lone extremist talking, some crazy person who found a microphone and a TV camera. We better check with the elected Mayor of Tijuana. If anyone can speak for the people of that city, he can. Here's what the Mayor had to say about the migrant Caravan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN MANUEL GASTELUM BUENROSTRO, MUNICIPAL PRESIDENT, TIJUANA (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): No city in the world is prepared to receive this if I may. It's an avalanche. It's a tsunami.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: An avalanche? A tsunami? Note the dehumanizing terms he uses. If this were a Liberal arts college in America, the Mayor might be suspended for saying that. He'd definitely be in some kind of diversity re-education class by now. If he worked at Google, he'd be fired instantly.</p><p>But he's not a student or a tech drone. He's the Mayor of Tijuana where people can still say what they think without fear of being denounced by Don Lemon on CNN as a White supremacist. So, they do say what they think.</p><p>And in Tijuana, what they think is that a massive and abrupt demographic change is destabilizing to a society, no matter what the color of the people involved might be. It's particularly destabilizing if you're not rich, and most people in Tijuana are not rich.</p><p>Even in Mexico, they're wary of ignoring the law completely, and treating borders like they don't exist. They know that doesn't end well. Most people know that doesn't end well. The difference is in Mexico they can say that out loud. We could learn from that.</p><p>Enrique -- Enrique Acevedo is an Anchor at Univision. He was just in Tijuana. He joins us tonight from Miami, Florida. Enrique, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>ENRIQUE ACEVEDO, ANCHOR, NOTICIERO UNIVISION LATE-NIGHT EDITION, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, THE FUSION MEDIA GROUP: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm confused. We just saw a group of Mexican citizens in Tijuana saying basically the same things that President Trump says almost to the word, endorsing Trump. Are they White supremacists?</p><p>ACEVEDO: Well, you have to understand that unlike human beings, intolerance, hate, and even racism flow freely across borders. And that's what you saw in those interviews. They're not running for president. They're not running for President of the United States either.</p><p>They are part of a group of around 300 protesters in a city of 1.3 million who, like many others along the way this Caravan, are opposed to -- to their presence in -- in Tijuana. And, you know, the overwhelming majority of people in Tijuana welcome immigrants. It's a city of immigrants--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait but --- wait but -- can I -- I'm sorry to interrupt but can I just back up a little bit--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --it was made by immigrants, as you know because you grew up in San Diego across the border.</p><p>CARLSON: --no it's -- it's a bit city, for sure. But can I suggest that (ph)--</p><p>ACEVEDO: So--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. You just said that they're racist but they're Latino, Spanish-speaking Latinos, attacking other Spanish-speaking Latinos. So where's the racism?</p><p>ACEVEDO: Well, we're not a monolithic community, Tucker. We have people from Central America, from Venezuela, from Colombia, different backgrounds, different ethnicities. And yes, racism exists in Mexico towards Central Americans. It's not new. It's happened through, you know, throughout history--</p><p>CARLSON: But how is it -- but I'm confused. How is it racist? Wait, but hold on--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --I know with that (ph). It's part of what this migrants face when they--</p><p>CARLSON: --how is this--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --go across Mexico, violence, extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --and racism.</p><p>CARLSON: No, OK, but I'm not quite sure how it's racism if they appear to be of the same race. But moreover, they said, and I think I'm quoting one of the protesters, it's not about racism.</p><p>This is almost exactly what he said. We want our government to enforce our borders, which is what a lot of people, including me, say frequently in the United States. Maybe, has it occurred to you, maybe it's not just racism? Maybe it's OK to want your government to keep your border intact?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACEVEDO: I think we should stop framing this debate about immigration in absolutes good, bad, enforcing, not enforcing the -- the border, as you saw there and, as you can see, is enforced.</p><p>There's border security through Border Patrol, through military, you know, members, and through things like drones and ATVs and high-tech surveillance equipment. So, we're enforcing the border. We're just getting ready--</p><p>CARLSON: So -- so how did all -- wait, but how did all the Hondurans--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --for these large teams of (ph) immigrants--</p><p>CARLSON: --get -- wait (ph)--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --which is not a crisis or an invasion--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --it's just a -- a, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. No, I know what the talking points--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --a large group of immigrants wanting to--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, I know what -- I know what the talking points are.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --to -- claim asylum.</p><p>CARLSON: What's so interesting about these interviews is that they seem to contradict the talking points. So, to the people of Tijuana, we could both agree they're probably not White supremacists. I -- I think we can take that as a matter of faith.</p><p>They seem to think this is a crisis. It's their city. And, by the way, their Mayor agrees with them. I assume he's not a racist, either, or maybe he is. Do you think they have any--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Actually I -- I interviewed the Mayor--</p><p>CARLSON: --real concern?</p><p>ACEVEDO: --last week and he--</p><p>CARLSON: Is he (ph) a racist too?</p><p>ACEVEDO: --rolled (ph) back some of those statements. He said that all immigrants are welcome in Tijuana and that he didn't mean any discrimination or harm to the people who were part of the Caravan. So, you know, in putting those--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I'm sure you bullied him, as--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --statements in context he was--</p><p>CARLSON: --as most politically correct media figures do. But before -- before we get to him retracting his statements under pressure from Univision, can we just address the core question, which is do you think he has any legitimate complaint? Does anybody who's city is overwhelmed by--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Of course.</p><p>CARLSON: --people from another country--</p><p>ACEVEDO: No, no and this--</p><p>CARLSON: --have any legitimate complaint at all--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --as it always been history (ph).</p><p>ACEVEDO: I -- I was just complaining that we framed the debate on immigration on absolutes. Of course, he has a point. You know, the city is overwhelmed by the presence of these migrants and governments--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --you know, all the governments involved should understand this is a humanitarian crisis and start acting like it, instead of just having these security measures at the border.</p><p>You know, again, I've said this a 1,000 times. We can spend a little more in the countries where these people are coming from and make a huge difference at the border or we can -- we can keep spending billions of taxpayers' dollars at the border--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so you figured out, wait, hold on--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --without making any sort of (ph) difference in the countries--</p><p>CARLSON: --so you figured out--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --where these people are coming from.</p><p>CARLSON: --you figure -- I'll -- I'll actually give -- give you airtime. We're live right now. You figured out how to fix Honduras and make it such a thriving country that no one wants to leave to raise GDP to American levels. How would you do it? Just really quick, how would you do that?</p><p>ACEVEDO: No, it's -- I'm -- I'm not coming up with a new idea. We've done this before--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK. I didn't think so.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --with USAID and it's worked (ph). We just need more resources--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it -- it hasn't worked, actually.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --focused on instead (ph) at the border.</p><p>CARLSON: It -- it's been a miserable failure.</p><p>ACEVEDO: Instead of spending a $100 billion over the past decade on border security, we could have used some of that money on programs that USAID has said--</p><p>CARLSON: So, which -- which program, hold on -- which program, hold on--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --it's been (ph) working. They're reducing violence (ph), the murder rate--</p><p>CARLSON: --I know -- I know what the talking point is.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --in the border towns where the migrants are coming from.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's get specific. I'm giving you a chance live on TV.</p><p>ACEVEDO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Which program specifically would have made the economy of Honduras so strong that no one would want to leave and come to the United States?</p><p>ACEVEDO: So USAID, for example, is working on two of the communities with the highest murder rate in Honduras. Throughout the last two or three years, with this program, they've been able to reduce violence there and, therefore, reduce the amount of people who were leaving that town. These are only two--</p><p>CARLSON: So, why do we have a--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --examples--</p><p>CARLSON: --Caravan of Hondurans coming if the USAID program worked so well?</p><p>ACEVEDO: Well because violence is not the only factor. We have other factors, poverty (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: So but I'm just saying what's the pro -- because I -- I hear that a lot from dump people on--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I think Don Lemon said that at on CNN, we should spend more money in these countries. Has there ever been a program that has changed a country in the third-world--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --they made it so appealing that no one wanted to come to the United States. I--</p><p>ACEVEDO: I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think there is a program like that, is there?</p><p>ACEVEDO: --but again, absolutes, no one. It's impossible to just have a program for -- for everyone. Violence is a factor. Poverty is a factor.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>ACEVEDO: Even climate now is becoming a factor. We saw a crew from the Weather Channel with the Caravan. They were, you know, tracking the -- the journey of a group of immigrants from Honduras where 90 percent of crops have collapsed.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ACEVEDO: John Carlos Frey, their correspondent, was telling me how the U.N. has declared (ph) Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --region with famine. So--</p><p>CARLSON: But -- but what about the people--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --so, you know, there are different factors.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I feel sorry for the people in the Caravan. And I -- and I understand why they want to come to the United States. I love this country. I appreciate their good taste in--</p><p>ACEVEDO: We all do.</p><p>CARLSON: --countries. But what about the people--</p><p>ACEVEDO: And -- and that's the great thing, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --of -- but hold on, what about everybody else?</p><p>ACEVEDO: Maybe we should be worried not that people were coming--</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --we should start worrying when people don't want to come to the United States--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Well that's going to happen soon--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --that's when we should start worrying.</p><p>CARLSON: --if we don't get a real border, so, because we'll be like Honduras, so, why would people want to move here? I mean honestly the -- honestly, my question is what about the people--</p><p>ACEVEDO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --who live in the United States or, in this case, who live in Tijuana, do they have any legitimate reason not to want--</p><p>ACEVEDO: By all means.</p><p>CARLSON: --they do have legitimate reason?</p><p>ACEVEDO: By all means, of course, you understand that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Good.</p><p>ACEVEDO: And we've discussed this in the past. Undocumented immigration is not a desirable outcome for any of the parties--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not. Well good--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --involved.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad you're admitting that.</p><p>ACEVEDO: You know, these people leaving their homes and the people who--</p><p>CARLSON: That -- that's all I want.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --you know the countries (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't have to be a racist to be against illegal--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --go against these (ph) immigrants--</p><p>CARLSON: --migrants.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --well there are better ways more humane, compassionate and common-sense laws that we could have instead of what we're doing with family separation--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't really think it's our fault--</p><p>ACEVEDO: --border limitation (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>ACEVEDO: --and these measures that really don't make any difference.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't -- I'm not going to accept blame for the disaster that is Central America, sorry. Enrique, thank you, though. Appreciate it.</p><p>ACEVEDO: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Brandon Judd is the President of National Border Patrol Council. He joins us tonight.</p><p>So Brandon, you're seeing what's going on in Tijuana right now. Do you see that, and I feel sorry for the people of Tijuana, I feel sorry for the people in the migrant Caravan, but do you think the chaos that we're -- we're watching on the screen in Tijuana vindicates the position of Americans who say, you know, this kind of Caravan can destabilize your society pretty quickly?</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: Well, they're absolutely correct. I mean all you have to do is look at what just happened at our Port of Entry, at the San Ysidro Port of Entry today.</p><p>This migrant Caravan, they were tired of waiting, properly waiting in line, waiting for their turn to claim asylum, and they tried to shut down the entire Port of Entry by rushing the Port of Entry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDD: Look, if -- if it wasn't for President Trump, and -- and him sending the troops to the border, doing what he did, we would have ultimately shut down a Port of Entry that generates millions of dollars for the -- the American economy per year, and we just can't have that. That's the lawlessness that we're facing.</p><p>But Tucker, I just walked out of a meeting with the President and to see him and to see the -- the things that he's trying to do to secure our borders, it's something that gives me great hope because he was left with a mess from his predecessors.</p><p>And this is a President that once and for all is trying to end this debate and trying to secure the border for the American public. And for that, everybody should be grateful.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I mean, people have differing views on what we should do about immigration. I think it's OK to have differing views about anything, really. But do you think it's helpful to shut down the conversation again and again and again by attacking people who disagree with you as bigots, as moral monsters?</p><p>JUDD: No. Again, I mean all you have to do is look at me. Unfortunately, I'm follically challenged. So, am I automatically a bigot because I don't have hair? The -- the -- the truth is -- is absolutely not.</p><p>I adopted two children of Hispanic descent. We're not bigots simply because we want border security. What we want is we want our children to be able to be raised in a country that believes in laws--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>JUDD: --that makes us free and protects us.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course. And the people of Tijuana want the same thing. Why wouldn't they?</p><p>JUDD: Yes, they do.</p><p>CARLSON: Brandon, thank you very much.</p><p>JUDD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a Democratic Member of Congress says it's time to ban millions of guns, take them from you by force, and if you don't like it, the government may kill you, for real. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Left are retaking the House of Representatives. Congressional Democrats are feeling newly emboldened about rolling back the Second Amendment. Early this year, California Democrat, Eric Swalwell, called for confiscating all so-called assault weapons, scary-looking rifles, and bringing criminal charges against anyone who resisted. We're not misquoting that. He wrote it in an op-ed in USA TODAY.</p><p>Then, just days ago on Twitter, one critic said this would provoke armed resistance against the government because, obviously, it would. Swalwell responded this way. \"It would be a short war, my friend. The government has nukes.\" In other words, obey or we'll kill you.</p><p>Jumaane Williams is a New York City Councilman. He joins us tonight. Mr. Williams, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JUMAANE WILLIAMS, NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, there's something admirable about the straightforwardness from our old friend, Congressman Swalwell. If you don't obey, we'll just kill you. What do you think of that?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Come on, Tucker. We have to -- we all have to get to a place where we can have a conversation about what's happening in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And have a respectful one (ph). So--</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think threatening people with violence is a good way to get to that--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think--</p><p>CARLSON: --rhetoric (ph)?</p><p>WILLIAMS: --that's a good way to have a conversation, nor do I think having a conversation about guns not being part of the problem is a good way to have a conversation. So, we should -- we should start with guns are a part of the problem, and figure out how to deal with that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But when a sitting U.S. -- and, by the way, we've at -- we know Swalwell very well.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: I personally like him. We asked him to come on to respond directly. I should say that. But when a sitting U.S. Congressman says, you know, if you just don't -- if you don't like it, if you're going to resist anyway (ph), we'll just drop a nuclear -- your nuclear weapons on you. We don't even threaten our -- our martial (ph) enemies with that. I mean that's a bit much, no?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, of course, I was remiss (ph), you know, prayers and peace of comfort for the victims of the Chicago mass shooting. But like the mother of a victim that happened in California who said she was tired of prayers, she wanted action, we have to have actionable items. And so, I don't consider nukes on people who have guns an actionable item. But there are actionable items and--</p><p>CARLSON: So, you are the moderate for the first time. I'm impress (ph)--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know about moderates.</p><p>CARLSON: --well, you're against killing American citizens so that puts you- -</p><p>WILLIAMS: If that's a moderate--</p><p>CARLSON: --that puts you in the moderate guidelines (ph). So, let me just ask you this. So, here's my confusion. I have no problem trying to disarm people who're threatening.</p><p>The problem I have with gun confiscation is that it punishes people like me who pose no threat at all and many millions of others Americans with no criminal record, no intent to harm anybody, want guns for self-defense, and it says to them, you're a criminal now because you have a gun that we think was--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you have jumped--</p><p>CARLSON: --scary.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --to confiscation.</p><p>CARLSON: Well but no, Eric Swalwell who's on -- who's a Member of the Intel Committee--</p><p>WILLIAMS: But -- but we should have a--</p><p>CARLSON: --half the time (ph)--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --conversation about one, is there an issue with guns in this country, and what do we do with that? And the--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --actionable items are quite clear. One, we can address loopholes in assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Two, we can deal with dealers who have been unscrupulous.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And three, we can begin to treat guns like we do cars. That's just on the demand side.</p><p>CARLSON: No but -- but -- no, but OK--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean on the supply side--</p><p>CARLSON: --then I'll address that (ph) I mean look--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --has to be on the demand side as well (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --you have Members of Congress, at least one prominent Member of Congress saying we're going to take your guns away by force, OK? So, apparently, you're not calling for that, though, we both know you're secretly for that. But would--</p><p>WILLIAMS: We don't both know that. But OK.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I believe you're -- I believe you're for that like many on--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait (ph) you can believe what--</p><p>CARLSON: --the Left (ph).</p><p>WILLIAMS: --you'd like. I'm here to have a discussion on the issue--</p><p>CARLSON: Are you for that?</p><p>WILLIAMS: --no, listen--</p><p>CARLSON: Good.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --let's have a -- we should have a discussion--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Then let -- let's talk about magazines--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --you say high-capacity. I think it means any more than 10. I -- if I have a magazine that has 15 round capacity, why is it a threat to anyone?</p><p>WILLIAMS: We have to start with, and I'm repeating this again, with everyone agreeing that guns and the access to guns are an issue in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Well how about this? I don't agree with that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You do not.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think a gun is a tool--</p><p>WILLIAMS: As I'm -- sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --and in the hands, like any tool, in the hands of someone with mal-intent, it's very dangerous.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, I will say this--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't have mal-intent. So, would I be forced to give up any magazines that I had that exceed the capacity--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --I will -- I will say this. If a -- if a hammer killed 33,000 Americans every single year, we would be screaming and yelling, \"Let's regulate hammers.\" Guns are only made for killing. What I'm saying is let's at least treat guns how we treat vehicles--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're speaking theoretically. And I want to--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I am not. I'm speaking--</p><p>CARLSON: --speak tangibly.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --specifically.</p><p>CARLSON: So there are millions upon millions of so-called high-capacity magazines out there. They're in circulation, tens of millions of them, what do we do with those?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, I mentioned three things. I mentioned dealing with the high- capacity magazines and the assault weapons. I mentioned the loopholes of gun dealers--</p><p>CARLSON: Let's just stick with the magazines for the conversation (ph)--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --but I mentioned also treating guns like we treat vehicles. That's just on the supply side--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But, you know, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry to press you for specifics but--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --we also have to deal with the demand side (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --since--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is what you do let me--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me press you. There are tens of millions of magazines that fit more than 10 rounds, in circulation. People -- normal people with no criminal--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --records own them. What do we do with them?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'll tell you what. In New York City, we're the safest city of guns we've been since 1951. I've been a leading voice in dealing with gun violence in New York City.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so -- so, you won't answer the question--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's why nobody trusts the gun people--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>CARLSON: --because we know that you're gun grabbers because you're--</p><p>WILLIAMS: A gun--</p><p>CARLSON: --not straightforward.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --again, part of the gun violence problem, actually it's (ph) last time--</p><p>CARLSON: What -- what would you do with the--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --you wouldn't (ph) answer it.</p><p>CARLSON: --magazines?</p><p>WILLIAMS: But -- but--</p><p>CARLSON: Is that not a fair question?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we have to start from someplace where we all agree.</p><p>CARLSON: No, that -- that -- no, no we don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS: If you want to -- we absolutely do (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: No, tell me what you think and then--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --because--</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe you can convince me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --the way you start, we'll never have a conversation. So, I want to start--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, you need to--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --from having a conversation--</p><p>CARLSON: --lie to me first--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>CARLSON: --and then oh you're (ph) not going to answer a straightforward question--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you? Are you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not lying at all.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm asking (ph) are you going to answer--</p><p>CARLSON: I'll tell you exactly what I think.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --a straightforward question? Are--</p><p>CARLSON: I'll answer any question.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --are guns a part of gun violence in this country?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course. They're the tool that is used very often to commit violence.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, we have to start--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --from that point. Finally--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's fine.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --thank you for agreeing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I have--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thank you for agreeing--</p><p>CARLSON: --if I have a--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --finally.</p><p>CARLSON: --high-capacity magazine in my possession, your -- your definition of high-capacity, and I don't want to give it up, will you take it from me?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, let's take that one off the table.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>WILLIAMS: What about the other two?</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, why -- why would -- hold on (ph)--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because you like to stick on the one that will prevent a conversation--</p><p>CARLSON: I look (ph) I'd like to ask very simple factual--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --from going forward.</p><p>CARLSON: --questions--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I mentioned three things--</p><p>CARLSON: --and see if you're straightforward enough to--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --I mentioned three things.</p><p>CARLSON: --answer them.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And so, the way this happens in government, people present things--</p><p>CARLSON: But why wouldn't you--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --and we figure out--</p><p>CARLSON: --answer them (ph)?</p><p>WILLIAMS: --because you want to get to a point where people will reject any conversation about dealing with guns.</p><p>CARLSON: But I think all of our viewers--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I want to get to a point--</p><p>CARLSON: --know where you stand.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --no, they don't.</p><p>CARLSON: The answer is, of course, I'm going to take it from you--</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, they don't.</p><p>CARLSON: --and punish you if you don't give it to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: The -- the -- the fact of the matter is we own -- we have less than 5 percent of the population and we own all the half of civilian guns--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --and 31 (ph) percent of mass shootings. But thank you for agreeing that guns are a part of gun violent problems in America. Next time, we have a--</p><p>CARLSON: I always say--</p><p>WILLIAMS: --conversation we can get to the phase (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --what I think.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: In -- in contrast to you, I will say--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I always say what's on my mind (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --to discuss (ph). Thank -- thank you for joining.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Appreciate it.</p><p>Colion Noir is an NRATV host and he joins us tonight. Mr. Noir, thanks a lot very much for coming on. So do you -- I'm starting to get the sense--</p><p>COLION NOIR, AMERICAN GUN RIGHTS ACTIVIST, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION MEMBER, NOIR HOST: Good to be here (ph), Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that confiscation, clearly the goal, because there's no other goal that makes sense. You can't -- if there are tens of millions of so- called assault rifles in circulation, and many tens of millions of these so-called high-capacity magazines, you're never going to solve the problem that the Left believes is responsible for gun violence unless you take those away, right?</p><p>NOIR: It's the only logical conclusion because if you think about it, if you start with gun control based around the idea of restricting or taking something away, if we got rid of, let's say, we got rid of the AR-15s, they account for less than 3 percent of gun deaths in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NOIR: So, let's say we get an Assault Weapons Ban, right? At that point all right, let's say another shooting happens like the one we just had recently, in California, where he used a handgun. Then they'll be telling us, \"You know what? That didn't work. So now we need to do something more strict, which is ban firearms.\"</p><p>So inevitably, we're -- it's always a race to total and complete confiscation but they never want to admit that. They want to act like they're being reasonable and say, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we just want to get rid of the big scary guns.\"</p><p>But it's like the big scary guns aren't the problem. They account for less than 3 percent of gun deaths. But 80 percent of gun deaths in this country are committed by way of handguns. So, if you honestly believe that the tool is the issue, why aren't you addressing the handguns?</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a very smart point, and one that I plan to bring up next time we speak to someone on the other side. But my question's even broader than that. Why in a chaotic, an increasingly chaotic world, the one that we live in, would you want to disarm normal law-abiding people? What threat do they pose?</p><p>NOIR: I think -- I think there are two different dynamics going on here. I think there's one dynamic, which is composed of people who are just generally ignorant about firearms. And then, I think there's another dynamic of people who are generally have an -- have an agenda to gain more control and to push the idea--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NOIR: --of reliance on -- on the government.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NOIR: And it sounds conspiratorial but it's not because if I'm self-reliant in my ability to protect myself, my natural inclination is not to depend on the government to be there when something goes wrong.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NOIR: And you can't push the necessity of -- of -- of government if you have a populace of people who understand and embrace the idea of self- reliance, especially when it comes to protecting your life and your family. And so, the people on the side (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: That -- that's a very deep point.</p><p>NOIR: --go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: No, that's it--</p><p>NOIR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I was just complimenting the point as deep. So, what you're saying is that many people on the periphery of the conversations haven't really thought about it, but the people who--</p><p>NOIR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --driving the conversation, who have thought about it, do have an agenda?</p><p>NOIR: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Ah.</p><p>NOIR: It's one of those things where -- go ahead, sorry--</p><p>CARLSON: No, that's it. I'm just impressed. Thank -- I hope you'll come back--</p><p>NOIR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and join us again, thank you.</p><p>NOIR: Absolutely, thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Nancy Pelosi led the Democrats back to a majority in the House, almost 40 seats. But now she could be removed from power anyway by her fellow Democrats. That smells like sexism. We're sounding the alarm right now. We're going to talk to Richard Goodstein about it, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Democrats just retook control of the House of Representatives after eight years, and the rest of us are waiting to see what they will do with their new political power. We know the Democrats despise the President. They've mentioned that. But what are they for? What's their organizing principle?</p><p>If you imagine something simple and straightforward like lower prescription drug prices or more transgender Marines, think again. Their mission is bigger than that. In fact, it's more metaphysical than it is political. The Democrats are planning nothing less than the moral revival of this country.

That's right. The party of sex-selective abortion is now lecturing you about morality. And, frankly, you're coming up a little short in that department.</p><p>You don't measure up to the high moral standards of, say, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a longtime friend and defender of Bill Clinton, Harvey Weinstein, and Anthony Weiner. Gillibrand has recently been reborn as a fire-breathing fundamentalist preacher. Here's a selection from a few of her sermons over just the past week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTEN ELIZABETH GILLIBRAND, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, NEW YORK: This country was founded on some basic moral principles that we have a moral compass as a nation.</p><p>Our morality as a country is literally on a knife's edge.</p><p>For me, it's really a moral question.</p><p>For me, it's very much a moral question.</p><p>I've been called to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore that moral integrity that moral decency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: For me, it's a moral question. Keep in mind the hand gesture. Keep in mind also that Senator Gillibrand isn't just fighting for moral integrity and moral decency. She says she has been called to fight for these things.</p><p>You know who called her? Don't you. It wasn't her friend, Anthony Weiner, from a prison payphone. Nope, it was God himself. He called Senator Gillibrand directly. He's got her cell. That's how close they are.</p><p>Remember when Democrats used to say they're worried about a theocracy? Who knew they'd try to start their own?</p><p>Well after eight years, the minority Democrats are, as we said, back in control of the House that may soon have a new leader of the House, the Speaker, a growing number of Democrats publicly voicing opposition to electing Nancy Pelosi to that job for another time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER-ELECT FOR VIRGINIA'S 7TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE U.S. HOUSE, FORMER CIA OPERATIONS OFFICER: One of the things that I talked about frequently on the campaign trail was the need to have new voices in Congress, the need to turn a new page.</p><p>SETH WILBUR MOULTON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR MASSACHUSETTS'S 6TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, FORMER MARINE CORPS OFFICER, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: We answer that call for new leadership by reinstalling the same status quo establishment leadership that we've had in this party since 2006 then we're letting down the American people.</p><p>KATHLEEN MAURA RICE, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRAT, FORMER PROSECUTOR: I think once we show that the leader can't get to 218, you're going to see other people throw their hat in the ring too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, there are lot of ways Pelosi could respond to that.

Toxic masculinity in the Democratic Party. Richard Goodstein, a living expert on this. No, just kidding. But he is an attorney and former advisor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, joins us tonight.</p><p>I didn't know, Richard, there was that much sexism in the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi says there is. What are you guys going to do about it?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER CLINTON ADVISOR: Yes. I was sorry to see Nancy Pelosi attribute these rebels to misogyny and sexism.</p><p>I -- I actually think she knows that's not what it is that when Conor Lamb was running for -- for election initially in that district in Pennsylvania that went for Trump by 20, and all these ads were being run saying, \"He was just going to be a puppet of Nancy Pelosi's,\" guess what, he said he wasn't going to vote for her if he got elected to be Speaker.</p><p>And you know what, he's not. It's not because she is a woman. It's because he made a commitment to his constituents because he basically thought that's what he needed to do to A, get elected, and B, what he thought was right that the Democrats needed to turn the page.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh. So, he just wants the most qualified candidate irrespective of her sex. I can't let you off the hook that fast, Richard. These are the rules that you guys wrote and the rules are as follows.</p><p>The most important thing about you is how you're born, your sex, your race, your sexual preference, your innate qualities, your DNA, that's what defines you. It's called identity, Richard. I don't know if you knew that in the intersectional world that you guys made, you can't just say, \"Oh, we found a better candidate.\"</p><p>You're blowing off a woman. 14 men are doing that. Is there an investigation into institutional sexism in the Democratic Party? I'm dead serious. Why wouldn't there be (ph)?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Yes, here's what's worse. The -- the problems for the Democrats, and I'm serious about this, it's got nothing to do with identity, it's with seniority. And -- and they, I think respect the fact that when Newt Gingrich came in that the Republicans did something different.</p><p>They basically said we're going to put the sort of younger, vital, able, competent people in our leadership position at committee chairs and it -- Paul Ryan's a young guy. And I think that's something that frankly a lot of Democrats wish Democrats could figure out a way to embrace. It has nothing to do with Nancy Pelosi's gender or -- or Congressman Clyburn's race. It has to do with the fact that--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Then but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but everything outside the Democratic Party's leadership structure, according to Democrats, has to do with race and gender, everything. I mean every time I flip on the Tube, there's some moron tugging his chin and saying, \"I don't see enough people of whatever in this picture.\" I mean that is the most basic Democratic talking point. But we're not supposed to apply it to the Democratic leadership because why?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, again, I think the Democratic talking points are about healthcare, about making sure that tax cuts go to working people, you know, about, you know, gun background checks, about infrastructure. That's what Democrats are united around.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Can they stop lecturing the rest of us about racism and sexism since clearly they don't hold themselves to the same standard? That's all I'm asking for.</p><p>That's -- by the way, I agree with -- I hope the Democrats talk about healthcare. I think it's an important topic. I think we'd all benefit from that. Can they lay off the race and gender stuff a little bit though since they're obviously not playing by those rules?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Again, Republicans put Nancy Pelosi on the ballot, all these ads they ran against her, Donald Trump said himself, he was on the ballot. And, as you just said, Democrats picked up 39 seats. Had (ph) nothing to do with race or gender, having to do with the sort of a belief that A, they needed an agenda that the Democrats supported, and B, frankly, to put a check on Donald Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: Wait. I'm -- I'm confused (ph). Wait but hold on, wait you just lied over (ph), nothing to do with race or gender, really, I mean or gender, how do we know that? So, here's what I know. Here are the stark facts of the case. Donald Trump is for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But Seth Moulton is not. Trump is comfortable with a strong woman in power. Seth Moulton clearly isn't.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Seth Moulton looks like a sexist to me, by this measure, and Donald Trump seems very enlightened.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's what I see. Why do you see something different?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: You're -- you're assigning weight to what Donald Trump says. I think most Democrats and, frankly, most people in the country anymore don't. With all due respect, they just don't assign weight to what he says- -</p><p>CARLSON: Look, I mean--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --because so many times he says things (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait he says he's for Pelosi. OK, how about this?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that aren't true.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm for Pelosi. Look, I'm just using the rules that you guys made up and enforce with Germanic efficiency on the rest of us. That's all I'm doing. And how does it feel? It feels bad because it's unfair and stupid, isn't it?</p><p>Can you just admit that? It's unfair and stupid and the rest of us have to live like this in fear and maybe you guys should live that way, just for a day, to see what it feels like. Do you see (ph) what I mean?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well OK. You're -- you're ascribing things that I think Democrats and the public generally, they wouldn't have voted in the Democrats to run the House if they accepted what your -- your proposition, Tucker. They--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha. I guess, I don't know why they did.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they--</p><p>CARLSON: Richard Goodstein, great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you're a sexist. I was just kidding.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the new face of the Democratic Party just endorsed a plot to make the party even more Liberal than it already is. Mark Steyn joins us to assess what happens. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Newly-elected Democratic Congresswoman and Democratic Socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has quickly become one of the most famous Democrats in America at the age of 28. And sometimes, occasionally, it is clear that she's only 28 as here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT, NEW YORK'S 14TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: I would love to get inaugurated January 3rd. January 4th, we're signing new (ph) healthcare, we're signing this, we're--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: --declassifying our society.</p><p>And if we work our butts off to make sure that we take back all three Chambers of Congress, rather all three Chambers of Government, the Presidency, the Senate and the House in 2020--</p><p>We look at these figures and we say, oh, unemployment is low, everything is fine, right? Well unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Some missteps but that does not mean she's not popular. She's very popular among the Democratic base and she's determined to remake the party along very different lines. She just gave support to Justice Democrats. That's a group plotting primary challenges to Democrats they deem insufficiently progressive and insufficiently diverse.</p><p>Author and Columnist Mark Steyn joins us, who I should say in an editorial comment is one of the single smartest people I've ever met in my life and who never went to college. So, if you're thinking about whether to send your brilliant son or daughter off to school at 70 grand a year, look at Mark Steyn and reconsider.</p><p>Anyway, I couldn't -- I couldn't control myself.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: No, no, drop-out at fifth, drop-out at fifth grade America. You'll -- you'll--</p><p>CARLSON: I looked it (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: --thank me for it.</p><p>CARLSON: --there's something to it anyway. That's another show. What do you -- so, the Democratic Party has a reckoning, it seems to me. They need to figure out who they are and what they stand for. What are they going to decide? Where are they going?</p><p>STEYN: Well I think they're going with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. You were -- you were talking with our pal, Richard, about identity politics. And there's actually something absurd about it. We had a fellow called O'Rourke pretending to be Hispanic, some kind of Hispanic--</p><p>CARLSON: You're talking about Beto.</p><p>STEYN: Be -- be -- be -- be -- Beto O'Rourke (ph) pretending to be Hispanic. And -- and essentially what you have permanently is extremely old White people--</p><p>CARLSON: Running against an actual Hispanic guy named Ted.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. And but you -- but if you look at, you know, Joe -- Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, and all about -- as you said, they're all about the identity politics (ph). They're saying, oh yes, you know, if you're a Muslim, a transgender then Joe Biden is your guy or Bernie Sanders is your guy.</p><p>And at a certain point, these identity groups, like the youngest Congresswoman, decide well, wait a minute. We'd like a piece of the action ourselves (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well exactly.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I don't know. I mean I have mixed feelings about this. I don't think that you should elevate people on the basis of irrelevant criteria like their race, of all things. I think it's immoral actually, no matter what the race is.</p><p>STEYN: I know (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: On the other hand, they wrote these rules.</p><p>STEYN: Right, yes, right.</p><p>CARLSON: And they don't want to live by these rules. But they want everyone else to live by the rules.</p><p>STEYN: And now, and they're being taken out by people who took them at their word like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I mean we can -- we can laugh at her. I thought though (ph) I don't even know what three Chambers of Government mean. I -- I -- I -- well, I do, because it's like if you're an immigrant it's in the test.</p><p>I think the three branches of -- the three branches of government are the Special Counsel, the Broward County Elections Office, and -- and the Judge who gave Jim Acosta his Press Pass back. They're the three branches of government.</p><p>But -- but what's more interesting is not that she doesn't know that but that millions and millions of Democrat voters don't think it's actually essential to know that. They're way beyond that now and they have a new view of America and she represents it. And fellows like Joe Biden and Bernie -- well Bernie does, but fellows like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary, they really don't.</p><p>CARLSON: They're -- they're in for a real reckoning, I think.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: They're about to find out that--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --their dumb ideas have consequences going to (ph) hurt them. Mark Steyn, great to see you, as always.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, and you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A rare in-person setting--</p><p>STEYN: Ha-ha.</p><p>CARLSON: --who'll be filling in, by the way, who's going to be hosting this show while I'm gone and we're always grateful that he does.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Have a good Thanksgiving.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Up next, there's new scientific evidence, of which you already knew, Facebook is making Americans miserable, depressed. What can we do about that? We'll tell you after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there's still more scientific evidence that Facebook and other tech companies are hurting America and distorting our brains. A brand new study by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania finds that Facebook, just Facebook, among many social media platforms, can substantially increase depression in people and loneliness, and these feelings go away when a person gets off Facebook.</p><p>This should not surprise us. Just a year ago, early Facebook investor, Sean Parker bragged that the company deliberately made the site as addictive as possible without caring at all about the harm it could inflict. Imagine if it's tobacco chieftains admitted that, they'd be in prison. But these people are (ph) walking free.</p><p>Tom Kersting is the Author of the book, Disconnected: How To Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Tom, I'm not going to ask if you're surprised by this because I know that you're not because you wrote a whole book on it. What is the answer for parents of teens, of young people, who are watching their kids slip away, become remote and sad because of overuse?</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: Well the number one advice I give, and I'm lecturing on this topic, is everybody is a -- we -- we had -- we've turned into a Keeping Up with the Joneses sort of society where everybody seems to be doing what everybody else is doing.</p><p>So, for example, the average age that kids are getting their first smartphone is fifth grade, and I can ask any parent--</p><p>CARLSON: That's the average?</p><p>KERSTING: --that's the average. The average -- average child is -- in fifth grade is getting a smartphone that has all the social media and everything else on it. And if we ask anybody that's listening, do we think that's a good idea as parents, they're going to say, \"No.\" Yet, the majority of them are doing it anyway.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: That's kind of a conformity sort of thing.</p><p>CARLSON: It is conformity. So, maybe the first step is saying out loud what everybody suspects which is this is destroying our society. It's making us dumb and sad.</p><p>KERSTING: It is. And as far as the depression component, all right, and I wasn't -- I was happy to see a study come out because they're always looking for a study, and sometimes we need to look at common sense when we look around and we see what's--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>KERSTING: --happening--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you know, the fact that the suicide rate among teenagers has gone up 70 percent since 2006 and all of the research behind are the researchers (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Seven -- just to -- please restate that. 70 percent since 2006--</p><p>KERSTING: Since 2006 among teenagers--</p><p>CARLSON: --suicide rate among young people--</p><p>KERSTING: --among teenagers, yes, has gone up 70 percent. And the researchers although there's nothing to substantiate it yet, but the researchers are suggesting that that's because of social media because when you're on social media all the time, what are you craving, what are you looking? You're looking for feedback. You're looking to fill an internal sense of self--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --from an external source. And self-esteem, joy, and happiness is an inside-out thing. It's never an -- it's never an outside-in thing. And that's where people are getting tangled up and they don't even realize it.</p><p>CARLSON: So the cigarette companies never killed that many teens, not even close, right?</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, exactly. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean it takes many years, right, to get sick from smoking.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And yet, they got hauled up and barbecued and basically federally regulated into near extinction because of the threat they pose to kids. But nobody's doing anything about this because why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, again, it goes back to -- there was a study that came out showing the dangers from the radiation from cellphones in California, all right, and when the Center of Disease Control came across the study, they refused to release the findings.</p><p>They had to go to Federal Court -- they had to go to State Court in order to get the findings released, and we know what it's about. It's about big tech industry, all the money that's behind that, the lobbying and -- and -- and everything that they -- they're not thinking about the well-being of the human beings. They're thinking about their bottom line.</p><p>CARLSON: The people who should be raising alarm are so caught up hating Trump, it's like they're missing the story, which is this is wrecking our country.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Tom, you've been a lonely voice in this subject.</p><p>KERSTING: I appreciate.</p><p>CARLSON: Hope (ph) you'll come back once again. Great to see you.</p><p>KERSTING: I would love to.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Much more ahead, much more news, breaking news from Washington, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Christmas season arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue today. Thanksgiving is three days away. But the White House Christmas Tree arrived via a Jingle Bell adorned horse-drawn carriage, as is tradition. And in a break with tradition though, the President himself was on hand to receive that Tree, best part of the job. It was a 19.5 foot fir. It will be displayed in the Blue Room.</p><p>Friday, by the way, is Black Friday. If you like to grab a copy of the book Ship of Fools, it's on tuckercarlson.com. That's it for us. Every night 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Have a great night.</p><p>Sean Hannity, live from New York City, right now.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: All right, Tucker, great show as always. And welcome to Hannity.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you, Sean.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018111901cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSH-2HS1-DXH2-635V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Guys, I love this squad over there. Thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody. Our top stories, tensions between the United States and China escalating as President Trump and his administration insist on America First foreign policy that includes fair trade, balance trade and respect for the U.S. and U.S. property throughout the world. China's president Xi Jinping and Vice President Mike Pence delivered dueling speeches in Asia over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presenting two very different views of global trade and security. We take that up, we discuss the latest in the U.S.-China relationship. China expert Gordon Chang with us. Also tonight, more in rest in Tijuana as Central American migrants are clashing with hundreds of local Mexican residents who don't want them in their city. President Trump remaining steadfast in his commitment to strong borders warning those in the caravan not to try to enter, not to try to enter the United States illegally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're not letting people in to our country illegally. And we're not doing a release. We'll do a catch but we're not doing releases. So, if they think they're going to be released into our country like in the old days, like for years and years they catch and release, we're not releasing. They don't get released.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We take up the latest in the situation south of our border. Fox Reporter William La Jeunesse, is reporting tonight from Tijuana and The Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese join us. In California, 80 are dead, nearly 1000 people are still missing as the deadliest fire in the state's history continue to burn ahead of an expected rainstorm. We'll have the latest from California, tonight.</p><p>Our top story, drop in the shares of Apple. Another big tech fueling a big selloff on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones Industrial is down almost 400 points. The S&amp;P 500 down 46, the NASDAQ lost more than 200 points. And amidst of the market turmoil, the White House continuing to demand fair trade policies from China ahead of an upcoming meeting that will take place between the President and Xi Jinping at the end of this month.</p><p>Edward Lawrence in Washington with the story. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Lou. Trade fair is part of that market drop. The breaking news tonight, the state department spokeswoman reacted to harsh language by the Chinese without mentioning China following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Now, the statement tonight reads, the United States is proud to agree to promote free and fair trade in the region and combat unfair trade practices.</p><p>It is unfortunate that not all economies despite their rhetoric could support these positions. And the cooperation summit fail to issue a joint statement for the first time in 29 years. The China blames the U.S. for spoiling the summit. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying, it seem like the U.S. attended this APEC meeting with great anger. Speeches and remarks at the meeting openly cause controversy, created discourse, spilling the atmosphere -- or spoiling the atmosphere of the meeting and did not contribute to achieving consensus.</p><p>Well, the Vice President brief the President today. This summit seem to escalate the trade dispute towards a trade war as China continues with their trading practices. They are not changing. The Chinese delegation led Vice-Premier supposed to meet in Washington this week, they canceled again. These were prep talks related to the G27 Summit bilateral meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Chinese say the meeting will happen after the bilateral on December 1st, assuming it goes well. Now, former FTC Chairman under President Reagan says, China should not underestimate President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIEL OLIVER, FORMER FTC CHAIRMAN: Trump is a very good negotiator. He negotiated with the Canadians and I think the Chinese should take a look at how we negotiated with the Canadians and get ready for more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now the Vice President told the Chinese the U.S. will not change course unless China changes their trading practices. The market reflected that in part with this hardening to -- part of the hardening tone with the selloff. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Edward, thanks so much. It's hard some days to tell whether it's hardening or whether it's just an awakening on the part of the Chinese to the fact that this president means business.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Yes. And resetting those for fair trade deals.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. And international economic order in need of rebalancing across the entire breath of those relationships. Edward, thank you very much. Edward Lawrence reporting from Washington. On the U.S. Southern border tonight, Homeland Security officials say the caravan of Central American migrants consisting of nearly all single adult or teen males and that at least 500 criminals have been identified among the ranks.</p><p>There are now about 6000 migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico. That is from the United States with thousands more expected to arrive behind them over the coming days. But as Correspondent William La Jeunesse now reports. They aren't receiving a warm welcome at all from the locals.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, as you know, illegal immigration is not new to Mexico. Generations of Central Americans have used this country as a steppingstone to the United States. But this caravan, how they cross the numbers seem to have awakened a silent now vocal minority against them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEUNESSE: Tension in Tijuana.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are here because our government has not taken control of these what we call invasions.</p><p>JEUNESSE: Shouting, Hondurans go home and viva Mexico. Riot police Sunday stopped hundreds of Mexicans trying to storm the migrant shelter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see people within the migrant caravan smoking weed, drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.</p><p>JEUNESSE: These Mexicans oppose illegal immigration and blame officials for allowing in thousands without papers. They fear crime, a loss of jobs, depressed wages in a country where 40 percent already live in poverty.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not in favor of them coming the way they did. You know, to me, if feels like they invaded.</p><p>JEUNESSE: Nearby, a counter protest supporters say Mexico should welcome and protect immigrants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's important that we consider that our Mexican brothers are also in the same situation.</p><p>JEUNESSE: The shelter Sunday remained on lockdown until protesters went home.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There here for work, to have a better life and no troubles. Not troublemakers.</p><p>JEUNESSE: More than 6000 caravan migrants arrived in Tijuana. Their shelter looking now like a refugee camp as many realize they cannot easily cross the border and any asylum interviews is at least five weeks away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell them it's better for you to get a job and it's not working right. And then (INAUDIBLE) trying to cross the border.</p><p>JEUNESSE: This morning for the first time, the U.S. shut down the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen saying in a tweet, CPB believe a \"large number of caravan migrants plants to rush the border to gain illegal access to the U.S\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEUNESSE: So by shutting down lanes and slowing traffic and increasing wait times, President Trump is sending a message to Mexico City that if you fail to stop these on your southern border you face consequences on the northern one. And Lou, he's doing it in a language that everyone understands, time is money. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: William, thank you very much. William La Jeunesse reporting from the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Rain headed for Northern California this week. Welcome rain bringing conditions that could both help and hinder efforts to put up the deadly campfire which has left at least 77 people dead. Correspondent Claudia Cowan has the latest tonight from Chico, California.</p><p>HAROLD SCHAPELHOUMAN, FIRE CHIEF, MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA: It's a grim task but it's necessary. It really does, you know, help families out because it allows them know what happened, as difficult as it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The flames may have slowed but the recovery from the devastating California wildfires still in its early stages with the death toll growing each day and the number of people unaccounted for constantly fluctuating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do this.</p><p>COWAN: Now, search crews are in a race against mother nature with rain in the forecast. While it will help put out the fire and improve air quality, rain could trigger mud slides and wash away the remains of those who died in the fire.</p><p>MIKE MOHLER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION: The weather that's expected is definitely going to impact operations. It's a - - especially during the recovery. I'm working with the Sheriff's Department and first responders. Again, we have additional resources out there really trying to work ahead of these storms.</p><p>COWAN: With more than 50000 left homeless by the campfire, thousands are streaming through a disaster relief center trying to get their lives back together.</p><p>KEVIN HANNES, FEDERAL COOPERATING OFFICER, FEMA: They can get initial financial support from FEMA if they qualified for Federal assistance. They can get information, they can get their drivers license renewed, they can update their mailing address with the postal service. Social Security cards can be issued here.</p><p>COWAN: An emotional vigil on Sunday night in Chico, California where the community came together to heal and share stories of their escape.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were basically a moving bomb because we had a bunch of propane tanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was leaves falling down on fire on top of us. Propane tanks blowing it up. It was -- it was like a war zone.</p><p>COWAN: Joe Florence (ph) and his family are thankful they made it out in time. And also for President Trump's visit here on Saturday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm grateful for all the support that he's given us. He didn't have to come here the way California (INAUDIBLE) and for that I'm very grateful.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COWAN: And the Federal aid that the President promised to help this community promised to help this community recover is flowing. More than $3-1/2 million is already in the hands of 13,000 households that have registered with FEMA here in Butte County. Those numbers will certainly grow. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Claudia, thank you very much. Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico, California. Still ahead here tonight, the White House has set new rules of conduct for journalists as the national left-wing media continues to attack President Trump rather than Jim Acosta's conduct.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jim Acosta's fight for press freedom resulted in a resounding victory for the first amendment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The system worked tax and balances worked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Having the press in the White House is actually more of it benefits the White House. So maybe the Trump administration is a little worried about cutting off that tool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a about a slippery slope. This is about what other reporters can be talking about this White House.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't even think Donald Trump understands the definition of decorum.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are watching the radioholic president at a point of his greatest rage and who it's at and his greatest rage is at the press.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll take that up with attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg Jarrett. But up next, new science that tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States are working and working very well. Asia expert Gordon Chang joins me to talk about the President's winning strategy and the threat of communist China when we continue. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A new report that demonstrates clearly President Trump is succeeding in making China pay for most of the trade tariffs. European researchers now saying American consumers and companies are absorbing only 4-1/2 percent of those tariffs of the 25 percent imposed on $250 billion of Chinese goods. The remaining 80 percent of those tariffs are being paid by China. And joining me now to talk about the very tense U.S.-China relationship and one that doesn't seem to be improving, Gordon Chang.</p><p>Author of the Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown. Gordon, good to have you here. And welcome back from Tokyo. Good to -- good to see you. But let's start with first these targeted tariffs that the President has implemented and more to follow if the Chinese do not come to their senses. I mean, this has to shock places like Goldman Sachs and the establishment forces that have been lobbying and against these tariffs. Your thoughts?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST: All the smart people who talks about how the American consumer was going to be the one paying for all the tariffs. Well, they are wrong and this is because the administration obviously picked out those areas where there was a lot of elasticity and that's good. You know, the important thing is that --</p><p>DOBBS: There goes Gordon using economics where I was just saying today, very few people talk about the elasticity that is the ability to substitute goods or to delay purchasing based on price.</p><p>CHANG: Yes. The important thing here is that when you look at the broader picture of the tariffs and the other things that the Trump administration is doing he is actually encouraging supply chains to get out of China. And that's important for us because those supply chains are held hostage by Beijing. Whenever they get upset about something and it's often not about trade, they go against our companies.</p><p>DOBBS: And sometimes we use the word -- the word supply chain are used too liberally when the word really is production of products themselves in China. And a dependence upon China for that production. That's got to change obviously as you say. Some other things have got to change. One is it's a communist government, they have expansionist and that's being kind. They have -- they have colonial it seems at times but certainly imperial -- imperatives within their foreign policy that they seem to be shocked that American president would resist as this one has.</p><p>CHANG: Yes. Well, Xi Jinping for more than a decade has been dropping hints that China is the world's only sovereign state. And this is just -- basically what he saying is that Americans, Japanese, whatever, you know, are just mere subjects to the greater glory of the Chinese court. You know, the important thing for us is that those trade that we have, you know, our factories in China are producing profits that China is then using to put into its military which is configuring itself to fight Americans.</p><p>And so there is a long chain here and it's not just economics, it's also of course security because China needs an enemy and they've identified us.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they've identified us. We should have been too hard to spot because we are the only superpower in the world. This is a -- this is a country under this president that is not recognizable to the power structure in Beijing, is it?</p><p>CHANG: No. One thing that President Trump has done especially this year is he's taken actions to defend the American economy. Defend the American society. Chinese leaders don't how to deal with it. So they try to talk to Henry Kissinger, they go try to talk to the heads of financial companies. And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: The establishment, Wall Street -- Wall Street has been carrying out what the Vice President referred to as lobbying exercise, calling Wall Street and American CEOs participating in the Chinese call for discussions and talks unregistered foreign agents. And my god, that's exactly what they are and kudos to the Vice President for saying it exactly the way it is.</p><p>CHANG: Yes. And you know, we saw that September 16th meeting in Beijing before the midterms. Obviously the Chinese were trying to use the heads of the big financial --</p><p>DOBBS: They still are.</p><p>CHANG: -- against the United States and it didn't work. And right now, the people in Beijing are scratching their head.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: It hasn't worked so far only because the CEOs didn't take them up on the offer. But they dispatch their minions from the -- in some cases from the seed level offices of their banks and firms. You know, this is an ugly thing we're watching. We're watching propaganda being organized against this President's policies. We're watching the establishment, try to subvert the President's policies on China on international trade.</p><p>And the idea that this stuff that has been circulating from the establishment whether it's at the Council of Foreign Relations or it's the Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, you know, we need quick wins here after this -- the midterms. The president's got a quick win. He won the Senate for crying out loud. He is accomplishing more and now they want to try to talk their way, insinuate themselves into this President's administration and to get him to -- in some cases dilute or even abandon policies that are -- that are certain to be effective.</p><p>CHANG: You know, the most important thing here is that these tariffs that people talked about, that are imposed under Section 301 of Trade Act of 1974 as a remedy for the theft of intellectual property. The NSA last week just came out with a report said China's theft of U.S. I.P. for commercial purposes has actually increased over the last year. We saw that report a couple days --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: When is the last time you heard one of the front companies being shut down by either the FBI or any intelligence operation of this agency of this country? You haven't. You haven't heard -- we know that for years they have been operating, literally thousands of front companies working through our universities as well to what? Gather intellectual property by the hundreds of billions of dollars they steal a -- every year.</p><p>CHANG: We just got that report that Micron Technology, their most recent chip has been completely stolen by the Chinese. That was $8.95 billion worth of I.P., just one theft and it's occurring across the board, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And these idiots -- and I will call them what they, they're traitors to the United States. Every one of these people trying to reverse this President's policies, vis-a-vis, Beijing are betraying this country and they're doing so for the -- the most sorted of reasons and that is their own commercial interests. Gordon, great to see. Thanks for being here.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: As always. Gordon Chang. Be sure to vote in our poll tonight. The question is, do you believe communist China finally comprehends President Trump's America First trade policies and demand for balance to free trade -- fair trade? And then into China's theft of U.S. technology is now nonnegotiable. Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs as always, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, the White House unveiling a new code of conduct for the White House press corps. Oh, that's going to make a few of them very uncomfortable. Journalists with the national left-wing media must act like adults. You think they can do that? Is this a fair set of guidelines? We take that and more right after the break. Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg Jarrett join me. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: The White House today outlining new rules for presidential news conference. The White House has dropped its effort to remove the hard pass of CNN reporter, Jim Acosta. The rules include limiting journalists to one question each, follow-ups at the discretion of the President. And the letter warn, should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action.</p><p>Well, joining me now to take up all of this, the fight over the acting attorney general and more Harmeet Dhillon, attorney, RNC Committeewoman for the great State of California. Great to have you with us. Gregg Jarrett, Fox Legal Analyst, author of the New York Times best-selling, the Russia Hoax. And always good to have you with us. Harmeet, let me begin with you. These rules tonight and if we could let's put those up full-screen just for a second.</p><p>These look pretty simple, straightforward, does this meet the test of due process that Judge Kelly asserted?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC CHAIRWOMAN: Well, it's step one in the due process. First, you have to have the rules announced in advance and then you have to have a warning and notice an opportunity to be heard in response. So, I do think it satisfies the due process and now it remains to be seen whether Acosta is going to carry out his part which is either behaving or being able to justify his actions.</p><p>And if he chose the line as a result of this and everybody will be better off and, you know, we won't have anything to worry about. But if he doesn't or somebody else doesn't, then yes, the White House has the right to institute proceedings, give them an opportunity to respond and then take a final action.</p><p>DOBBS: Your thoughts.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST: There have always been rules of decency and decorum that White House correspondents have always practiced when I was there temporarily. I knew the rules, I abided by the rules. Then it comes along guys like Jim Acosta. And they think they have the right to be rude and abrasive and obnoxious and commandeer the news conference and argue with the President and prevent his colleagues from posing their questions.</p><p>DOBBS: You have to believe that they are a little upset, the White House press corps that he has messed it up.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes. And if I were press secretary, what I would do is the next time Acosta pulls that I would say that's the end of the news conference, not only today but for the rest of the week.</p><p>DOBBS: That's what the President said he will do.</p><p>JARRETT: And the -- his colleagues, Acosta's colleagues would have surrounded him and threatened to tar and feather and then kick him out. And that is the most effective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT: -- get rid of that kind of conduct. You know --</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, let's be honest here, I want to ask you both. Why -- Isn't there a time where you have to just tell a district court judge to go to hell? Because I mean, the idea that you have to follow the dicta of a district court judge and create rules and can't run the White House that it's been run since time (INAUDIBLE) Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, Lou, to be -- to be fair to the judge, if you read his ruling from the bench, it seems clear that he felt that he was constrained by a prior decision.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, but that's (INAUDIBLE) nonsense. That was a 1977 -- excuse me Harmeet that was an idiot in my opinion ruling.</p><p>DHILLON: OK.</p><p>DOBBS: This judge took a case in which you're dealing with a nation reporter. It wasn't about anything but his politics, it had nothing to do with conduct, it had nothing to do with decorum. And disrupting a presidential press conference, it wasn't on point at all in my opinion. You guys are the lawyer but I mean --</p><p>DHILLON: Right. Well, your question -- yes, your question was should we tell the judge to go to hell and the answer is that's generally not a good idea. And I do think that norms announced in advance even though they're obvious like, you know, you shouldn't have to tell people to behave like adults but now that we have that, well, I think it's actually a good --</p><p>DOBBS: You shouldn't have to tell a district court judge to get back on your -- get back on your bailiwick either, what do you think?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, on the other --</p><p>JARRETT: Wait, you're absolutely right. When you are of -- there's no freedom to be obnoxious and rude, there's no freedom of the press to question the president. It's a privilege to be there at the White House and there are rules and norms that have always been followed. And now you've got a judge who has decided to expand due process beyond any resemblance --</p><p>DOBBS: He's telling the president of the United States how to conduct the --</p><p>JARRETT: And I agree with you, I would tell the judge go to hell. We're going to practice the way we want. Let the Supreme Court decide it if necessary.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me turn very quickly to the president prepared to give his written answers to Robert Mueller. Let's take his comments to Chris Wallace yesterday, if we could please.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The questions were asked and answered, wasn't a big deal. You know, they make it like I had meetings for many, many hours. I got the questions, I responded, we wrote them out, I read them once, I read them a second time we made some changes, that's it. I think that should solve the problem. I hope itself is a problem, if it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time but probably this is the end.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: There's the president Harmeet, is this the end in your best judgment?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, I think it should be the end from the president's side. I think this is handled correctly and this is the extent of his involvement in this now. Who knows what Mueller is going to do with this and there may be a second round. This may attempt to go on forever but I hope for that this puts an end. Arrest and this is the appropriate way to handle it, given how busy the president is.</p><p>DOBBS: Gregg?</p><p>JARRETT: With obstruction off the table, it should've taken five minutes to answer the questions. I don't know anything about collusion, I don't know anybody else in my campaign who knew or colluded with Russia, end of story. And you can dismiss allegations of the Trump Tower meeting. Did Trump know in advance? I did not he said that repeatedly. Did you mislead anyone in your dictated statement it was accurate to the best of my knowledge. So, I mean, those are the main questions they should be easy to answer.</p><p>DOBBS: And after over two years of investigating this president and his administration, enough is enough, it's enough. It's actually far more than enough.</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: Harmeet Dhillon, Gregg Jarrett thank you both for being with us tonight, thank you.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, after nearly two weeks, the results are settled in Florida. It's up two victories -- two victories for the President and the Republicans, the Senate majority for the Republicans is growing. We take that up and more with the dynamic duo, Diamond and Silk joining us tonight. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street today a big sell-off. The Dow losing almost 400 points, the S&amp;P lost 46, the NASDAQ down 219. Volume on the big board 3.7 billion shares.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet all dropping into bear market territory closing out the day. Facebook's stock plummeted heading in -- heading into 2019. The company's stock losing five percent hitting its lowest level since February of 2017. Facebook on track for its longest quarterly loss to --losing streak since 2013.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook weighing in on the possibility that Congress will regulate big tech, here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free markets not working and it hasn't worked here and I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The president has said as much. The president making it very clear that he is not thrilled with monopolistic powers or the oligopolies that have formed in technology.</p><p>A reminder listened to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Embattled controversial election supervisor. A Broward CountyFlorida has produced a suitable ending, Brenda Snipes has resigned. Snipes facing criticism for her failure to comply with Florida law and the 2018 midterms after years of incompetence and skulduggery, President Trump called for her to be fired. Just days ago, her resignation takes effect. Are you ready? She's a lame-duck. Her resignation effective in January taking a page out of -- well, someone we all knows book.</p><p>Joining me now, social media superstars, President Trump's most loyal supporters, Diamond and Silk. Great to have you with us. Let me start by asking you, will there be now national left-wing media focus on the fact this president has achieved a terrific victory for the U.S. Senate enlarging the GOP majority?</p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK: It should be, they should focus on that, but you know they're not. What they will focus on the left-wing media is start throwing the racist word around or this is racist or somebody as being racist towards me. I absolutely love and I'm so thrilled that Brenda Snipe's out. Was that she's stepping down.</p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK: Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY: She should have been fired a long time ago. Because if you look at what she did in this whole process is what they were trying to do. They were -- they were doing a rehearsal getting prepared for the 2020 run.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: It was going to be the art of the steal and I want everybody. I don't care what's on the aisle you're on to look at that. When you break our election laws and do what you want to and not answer questions that should be answered.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: You're trying to take something you're trying to steal but she should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p>DOBBS: You know governor elect DeSantis saying that there was no way that she was going to be the election supervisor through another election. I'm amazed that they put up with the shenanigans and being very kind. The cheating and the stealing in that elections office as long as they did.</p><p>The White House press corps let's turn their, new rules. We can call them the -- I don't know what the Acosta rules. I don't know what you would want to call them, in which the whole press corps gets to ask one question, they've got to be civil and they've got to be kind of focused on their manners. What do you think?</p><p>HARDAWAY: Well, listen, I absolutely love it. I think Acosta if he wants to be respected as a journalist, he have to respect the White House and respect the president.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: He's going to have to do that. No more acting like a baby, no more wanting to suck on your pacifier. We're not going to put you on timeout. If you do, if you defy the rules --</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: -- you're going to get thrown out, not a timeout but up at that White House and your press conditions are going to be taken again.</p><p>RICHARDSON: So, the bottom line is this Lou, if you act like a child you would be treated like a child, bottom line.</p><p>DOBBS: And certainly in the presence of the President of the United States and in the White House itself, I would think that would come as second nature to any American.</p><p>Let me -- let me turn first to in terms of foreign policy, a president who has introduced the entire country and all of our trading partners to an extraordinary concept. We're going to have balanced trade, you're not going to steal from us by the hundreds of billions of dollars a year anymore. Specifically that case obviously fits China. They're behaving like children, they want to be able to keep stealing and they think that we should be subsidizing their economy and buying their products no matter what the impact is on our workers and our corporations. Your thoughts about the Chinese having just a bit of a fit over this insistence by the president.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Well, they're going to have to stop having this little hissy fit.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Because you have a new sheriff in town, its President Donald Trump and he's a businessman and it's going to be fair and equal trade across the board. You're not going to steal from us and they're going to have to get that through their head. And President Trump is not going to waver nor is he going to back down. I know that they're used to dealing with weak presidents like President Obama and the rest of them.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY: But you have a strong president that's not going to tolerate.</p><p>RICHARDSON: And you have a strong president that's putting American first baby. It's about America because charity starts at home not abroad.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you so much for being with us. It's always great to see you my friends. Thanks so much Diamond and Silk.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Thanks for having us.</p><p>DOBBS: All the best. Well, Pope Francis dining with 1,500 people, poor people in the Vatican over the weekend. And there, he decried the plight of the indigent. As he addressed the crowd of Francis lamented the poor are weeping quote, while the wealthy few feast on what injustice belongs to all. Injustice is the perverse root of poverty.</p><p>Up next, there could be fewer U.S. troops along our southern border with Mexico. Are you ready for this already? We're hearing from a general about troop levels. The caravan has arrived in Tijuana. Thousands more expected, what is going on? We take up these latest developments with The Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese when we return. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The Pentagon may begin scaling back the troops posted along our border with Mexico as early as this week. The army commander overseeing the mission Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan telling Politico the missions end date remains December 15th that all of the active duty troops who were sent to the border could be home by Christmas despite the expected arrival of thousands more in caravans at the southern border in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>According to a new poll from Monmouth University, more than half of Americans see the migrant caravans moving toward the country as a threat to the United States. In the poll released today nearly a third of them see the caravans is a major threat. And the same poll found seven and ten Americans see illegal immigration as a serious issue. Joining us tonight to discuss the caravan, Jim Acosta's new rules, and the sore losers in the Democratic Party, the Daily Callers Editorial Director Vince Coglianese. It's good to have you with us, Vince.</p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLERS: Nice to be here, Lou. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Let us start with this unexpected announcement that troops may apparently be withdrawn very quickly from the border.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes, I think -- I thought an underlying principle of the Trump administration is that we don't broadcast our intentions with our military ahead of time. We have to keep people guessing for national security reasons and that's not what's happening here. I think what you're pointing out is that it's a bit of a bizarre messaging to say hey the troops are going to be away from the border by Christmas. And if you are the -- if you're looking to illegally immigrate into the United States, you now have a great time lined by which to do that. So that's -- I think that's a bit uninspired to be giving those sorts of answers whether or not you intend to actually do it.</p><p>DOBBS: This lieutenant general who I haven't heard of before but that doesn't mean anything necessarily, had to surely understand this is a political question of great sensitivity and that he would be very wise indeed to not speak to it without White House approval, in fact insisting I would think for his own career that it come from the White House.</p><p>COGLIANESE: It was clearly an issue of sincere concern of the President of the United States so that would be my first thought too, what does the White House think of this, the statement I'm about to make. And I think what you're seeing if I'm just making a prediction here holding on my finger at the wind, it looks like the military is succumbing a bit to the liberal media pressure on this question. This idea -- you saw the New York Times run this big story. The troops are out there. They're going to miss holidays. They signed up to defend our country. They signed up for our national security. And one of the paramount concerns is the integrity of our borders.</p><p>These men and women on the border doing the job they were asked to do by their Commander-in-Chief and yet the New York Times is coming at it from the perspective of how dare they even be a part of this and I think the military is coming to that a little bit by broadcasting this idea that oh don't worry, everyone will be home by Christmas. There won't be military on the border to assist the border patrol. Not a good message to send when you have so many illegal immigrants knocking on the door.</p><p>DOBBS: No matter what, there's a serious problem in the Pentagon because once again Mattis, the Defense Secretary is putting himself in at this point what appears to be opposition to the Commander in Chief. Indeed a stunning stuff to witness.</p><p>COGLIANESE: And General Mattis went to the border this week with Kirstjen Nielsen this past week to actually survey the activity of the troops. It's nice to see him out there. I think that's a good thing encouraging the troops, and that's -- and that's the key here. And look, the reason those troops are on the border is to assist the Border Patrol in its very tall task. I mean, you look at this migrant caravan that's standing in Tijuana right now, that is not even the start of it. Think back to October. You know this really well, Lou. Nearly 60,000 people were arrested or turned back at the border with the United States in Mexico. That's a record. And that means that this migrant crisis is continuing every day. Caravans, forget caravans. We have a caravan coming every day into the United States of America.</p><p>DOBBS: And let me turn to the White House since we're on that subject, and that is the new rules announced by Sarah Sanders today, the new rules for journalists in the White House press corps.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: One question, you know, behave yourself, we'll see how things go is my summation. Your reaction to these new Acosta rules.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Look, that's the key. That's the key right there. This is Jim Acosta's fault. The reality is, if you're a member of that press corps, if you're in that White House press briefing room, yes, of course, you're standing up alongside your fellow reporter arguing for the most amount of times ask questions that you can possibly get. But here's the key. Jim Acosta, by virtue of the debate he held with the President of the United States, not questioning a debate. He started to -- he started out by saying he wanted to challenge the President on a talking point. That's not the role.</p><p>The role is to get information out of the president for the American people and he failed in that core test. And in so doing, he made it worse for the entire press corps because now they have restrictive rules on their ability to ask follow-up questions, all courtesy of one man Jim Acosta.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, one man and one organization. Then you go to Jeff Zucker at CNN, then you go to the parent Time-Warner, and then you go to the parent of the parent which is AT&amp;T. And the reality is we're watching corporate behemoth direct the conduct that of a Jim Acosta.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: There's a purpose in it and no one should mistake that. We're watching Comcast when it comes to NBC. I mean, it goes on and on. These are corporate, corporate journalists behaving that way. Obviously at the direction of their corporations.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Well, if you want you want to do something fun or if your viewers ever want to basically take a look at like how that White House press briefing room was actually composed and who gets paid by whom in that room, look no further than the first couple rows. Fox has a couple of reporters by virtue of Fox News radio and Fox News and Fox Business, of course. But those are individual networks. What you have in that room are Washington Post reporters, New York Times reporters. The first couple rows, they're all paid by CNN and MSNBC. They're paid contributors to those networks. In other words, those two lefty networks have control, are paying a huge percentage of the major figures who were that press briefing. That is a very real conflict of interest.</p><p>DOBBS: Conflict of interest and one you would think that the White House would want to examine very carefully. You know, the issue of Acosta, the CNN, you know, I just have to think that the White House press corps is beside itself with these rules coming down all because of the way Acosta behaved and you know, did so with you know, I mean it just doesn't make any sense to me.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Unquestionably. But one of the lessons I take from this is like the seething hatred for the Trump White House must be so great in that room that they're willing to tolerate the insanity of Jim Acosta which strikes me as the most bizarre thing ever. At some point, they have to tap out in the go, you know what, Jim Acosta, you are poorly serving our ability to actually ask questions of the White House.</p><p>DOBBS: And I don't suppose that would be possibly a part of the White House strategy to make certain that they become self-policing and self- aware. Vince Coglianese, great to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, more on the migrant Caravan as they find out what happens in Tijuana, the Mexican people weren't too thrilled with them and they are the ones protesting illegal immigrants not on this side of the border. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Last week we asked you if you believe President Trump's border wall will ever be built? 67 percent of you said yes, and the rest, no. Well, here's where we are tonight, what we're looking at tomorrow. The migrant caravan in Tijuana now is facing such opposition from angry local residents there reporting this fights in rocks hurl. The Department of Homeland Security also says at least 500 people, 500 of them criminals have been identified within the caravan.</p><p>Brenda Snipes, the Broward County Florida election supervisor is -- she's submitted her resignation. Over the last two weeks she's been responsible for misplacing if you will, 2,000 ballots, counting those ballots, mixing invalid ballots with good ones, failing to meet a deadline with machine recount results altering the outcome of course of the recount, and in fact, disqualifying it.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. Tomorrow night, please be with us. We'll see you then. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2018111901cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSG-JHF1-DXH2-61X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>America First</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CPB</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>San Ysidro Port of Entry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FEMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chamber of Commerce</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wall Street</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Council of Foreign Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NSA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Micron Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100QG</classCode><className>COUNTY GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Our top  stories, tensions between the United States and China escalating as  President Trump and his administration insist on America First foreign  policy that includes fair trade, balance trade and respect for the U.S. and  U.S. property throughout the world.  China's president Xi Jinping and Vice  President Mike Pence delivered dueling speeches in Asia over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Presenting two very different views of global trade and security.  We take  that up, we discuss the latest in the U.S.-China relationship.  China  expert Gordon Chang with us.  Also tonight, more in rest in Tijuana as  Central American migrants are clashing with hundreds of local Mexican  residents who don't want them in their city.  President Trump remaining  steadfast in his commitment to strong borders warning those in the caravan  not to try to enter, not to try to enter the United States illegally.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're not letting people in  to our country illegally.  And we're not doing a release.  We'll do a catch  but we're not doing releases.  So, if they think they're going to be  released into our country like in the old days, like for years and years  they catch and release, we're not releasing.  They don't get released.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We take up the latest in the situation south of our border.  Fox  Reporter William La Jeunesse, is reporting tonight from Tijuana and The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese join us.  In California, 80 are dead,  nearly 1000 people are still missing as the deadliest fire in the state's  history continue to burn ahead of an expected rainstorm.  We'll have the  latest from California, tonight.</p><p> Our top story, drop in the shares of Apple.  Another big tech fueling a big  selloff on Wall Street today.  The Dow Jones Industrial is down almost 400  points.  The S&amp;P 500 down 46, the NASDAQ lost more than 200 points.  And  amidst of the market turmoil, the White House continuing to demand fair  trade policies from China ahead of an upcoming meeting that will take place  between the President and Xi Jinping at the end of this month.</p><p> Edward Lawrence in Washington with the story.  Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Lou.  Trade fair is  part of that market drop.  The breaking news tonight, the state department  spokeswoman reacted to harsh language by the Chinese without mentioning  China following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  Now, the  statement tonight reads, the United States is proud to agree to promote  free and fair trade in the region and combat unfair trade practices.</p><p> It is unfortunate that not all economies despite their rhetoric could  support these positions.  And the cooperation summit fail to issue a joint  statement for the first time in 29 years.  The China blames the U.S. for  spoiling the summit.  A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying,  it seem like the U.S. attended this APEC meeting with great anger.   Speeches and remarks at the meeting openly cause controversy, created  discourse, spilling the atmosphere -- or spoiling the atmosphere of the  meeting and did not contribute to achieving consensus.</p><p> Well, the Vice President brief the President today.  This summit seem to  escalate the trade dispute towards a trade war as China continues with  their trading practices.  They are not changing.  The Chinese delegation  led Vice-Premier supposed to meet in Washington this week, they canceled  again.  These were prep talks related to the G27 Summit bilateral meeting  between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump.</p><p> The Chinese say the meeting will happen after the bilateral on December  1st, assuming it goes well.  Now, former FTC Chairman under President  Reagan says, China should not underestimate President Trump.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DANIEL OLIVER, FORMER FTC CHAIRMAN:  Trump is a very good negotiator.  He  negotiated with the Canadians and I think the Chinese should take a look at  how we negotiated with the Canadians and get ready for more.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now the Vice President told the Chinese the U.S. will not change  course unless China changes their trading practices.  The market reflected  that in part with this hardening to -- part of the hardening tone with the  selloff.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  Edward, thanks so much.  It's hard some days to tell whether it's  hardening or whether it's just an awakening on the part of the Chinese to  the fact that this president means business.  </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Yes.  And resetting those for fair trade deals.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.  And international economic order in need of  rebalancing across the entire breath of those relationships.  Edward, thank  you very much.  Edward Lawrence reporting from Washington.  On the U.S.  Southern border tonight, Homeland Security officials say the caravan of  Central American migrants consisting of nearly all single adult or teen  males and that at least 500 criminals have been identified among the ranks.</p><p> There are now about 6000 migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico.  That  is from the United States with thousands more expected to arrive behind  them over the coming days.  But as Correspondent William La Jeunesse now  reports.  They aren't receiving a warm welcome at all from the locals.  </p><p> WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou, as you  know, illegal immigration is not new to Mexico.  Generations of Central  Americans have used this country as a steppingstone to the United States.   But this caravan, how they cross the numbers seem to have awakened a silent  now vocal minority against them.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> JEUNESSE:  Tension in Tijuana.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here because our government has not taken  control of these what we call invasions.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  Shouting, Hondurans go home and viva Mexico.  Riot police Sunday  stopped hundreds of Mexicans trying to storm the migrant shelter.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see people within the migrant caravan smoking weed,  drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  These Mexicans oppose illegal immigration and blame officials  for allowing in thousands without papers.  They fear crime, a loss of jobs,  depressed wages in a country where 40 percent already live in poverty.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not in favor of them coming the way they did.  You  know, to me, if feels like they invaded.</p><p> JEUNESSE:  Nearby, a counter protest supporters say Mexico should welcome  and protect immigrants.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's important that we consider that our Mexican  brothers are also in the same situation.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  The shelter Sunday remained on lockdown until protesters went  home.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There here for work, to have a better life and no  troubles.  Not troublemakers.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  More than 6000 caravan migrants arrived in Tijuana.  Their  shelter looking now like a refugee camp as many realize they cannot easily  cross the border and any asylum interviews is at least five weeks away.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I tell them it's better for you to get a job and it's  not working right.  And then (INAUDIBLE) trying to cross the border.</p><p> JEUNESSE:  This morning for the first time, the U.S. shut down the San  Ysidro Port of Entry.  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen saying in a tweet, CPB  believe a \"large number of caravan migrants plants to rush the border to  gain illegal access to the U.S\". </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> JEUNESSE:  So by shutting down lanes and slowing traffic and increasing  wait times, President Trump is sending a message to Mexico City that if you  fail to stop these on your southern border you face consequences on the  northern one.  And Lou, he's doing it in a language that everyone  understands, time is money.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  William, thank you very much.  William La Jeunesse reporting from  the San Ysidro Port of Entry.  Rain headed for Northern California this  week.  Welcome rain bringing conditions that could both help and hinder  efforts to put up the deadly campfire which has left at least 77 people  dead.  Correspondent Claudia Cowan has the latest tonight from Chico,  California.  </p><p> HAROLD SCHAPELHOUMAN, FIRE CHIEF, MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA:  It's a grim task  but it's necessary.  It really does, you know, help families out because it  allows them know what happened, as difficult as it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The flames may have slowed but the  recovery from the devastating California wildfires still in its early  stages with the death toll growing each day and the number of people  unaccounted for constantly fluctuating.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do this.</p><p> COWAN:  Now, search crews are in a race against mother nature with rain in  the forecast.  While it will help put out the fire and improve air quality,  rain could trigger mud slides and wash away the remains of those who died  in the fire.</p><p> MIKE MOHLER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION:  The  weather that's expected is definitely going to impact operations.  It's a - - especially during the recovery.  I'm working with the Sheriff's  Department and first responders.  Again, we have additional resources out  there really trying to work ahead of these storms.  </p><p> COWAN:  With more than 50000 left homeless by the campfire, thousands are  streaming through a disaster relief center trying to get their lives back  together.  </p><p> KEVIN HANNES, FEDERAL COOPERATING OFFICER, FEMA:  They can get initial  financial support from FEMA if they qualified for Federal assistance.  They  can get information, they can get their drivers license renewed, they can  update their mailing address with the postal service.  Social Security  cards can be issued here.  </p><p> COWAN:  An emotional vigil on Sunday night in Chico, California where the  community came together to heal and share stories of their escape.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were basically a moving bomb because we had a bunch  of propane tanks.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was leaves falling down on fire on top of us.   Propane tanks blowing it up.  It was -- it was like a war zone.  </p><p> COWAN:  Joe Florence (ph) and his family are thankful they made it out in  time.  And also for President Trump's visit here on Saturday.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm grateful for all the support that he's given us.   He didn't have to come here the way California (INAUDIBLE) and for that I'm  very grateful.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COWAN:  And the Federal aid that the President promised to help this  community promised to help this community recover is flowing.  More than  $3-1/2 million is already in the hands of 13,000 households that have  registered with FEMA here in Butte County.  Those numbers will certainly  grow.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  Claudia, thank you very much.  Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico,  California.  Still ahead here tonight, the White House has set new rules of  conduct for journalists as the national left-wing media continues to attack  President Trump rather than Jim Acosta's conduct.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jim Acosta's fight for press freedom resulted in a  resounding victory for the first amendment.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The system worked tax and balances worked.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Having the press in the White House is actually more of  it benefits the White House.  So maybe the Trump administration is a little  worried about cutting off that tool.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a about a slippery slope.  This is about what  other reporters can be talking about this White House.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't even think Donald Trump understands the  definition of decorum.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are watching the radioholic president at a point of  his greatest rage and who it's at and his greatest rage is at the press.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We'll take that up with attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett.  But up next, new science that tariffs on Chinese exports to the  United States are working and working very well.  Asia expert Gordon Chang  joins me to talk about the President's winning strategy and the threat of  communist China when we continue.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  A new report that demonstrates clearly President Trump is  succeeding in making China pay for most of the trade tariffs.  European  researchers now saying American consumers and companies are absorbing only  4-1/2 percent of those tariffs of the 25 percent imposed on $250 billion of  Chinese goods.  The remaining 80 percent of those tariffs are being paid by  China.  And joining me now to talk about the very tense U.S.-China  relationship and one that doesn't seem to be improving, Gordon Chang.</p><p> Author of the Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown.  Gordon,  good to have you here.  And welcome back from Tokyo.  Good to -- good to  see you.  But let's start with first these targeted tariffs that the  President has implemented and more to follow if the Chinese do not come to  their senses.  I mean, this has to shock places like Goldman Sachs and the  establishment forces that have been lobbying and against these tariffs.   Your thoughts?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST:  All the smart people who talks about how  the American consumer was going to be the one paying for all the tariffs.   Well, they are wrong and this is because the administration obviously  picked out those areas where there was a lot of elasticity and that's good.   You know, the important thing is that --</p><p> DOBBS:  There goes Gordon using economics where I was just saying today,  very few people talk about the elasticity that is the ability to substitute  goods or to delay purchasing based on price.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  The important thing here is that when you look at the broader  picture of the tariffs and the other things that the Trump administration  is doing he is actually encouraging supply chains to get out of China.  And  that's important for us because those supply chains are held hostage by  Beijing.  Whenever they get upset about something and it's often not about  trade, they go against our companies.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And sometimes we use the word -- the word supply chain are used too  liberally when the word really is production of products themselves in  China.  And a dependence upon China for that production.  That's got to  change obviously as you say.  Some other things have got to change.  One is  it's a communist government, they have expansionist and that's being kind.   They have -- they have colonial it seems at times but certainly imperial --  imperatives within their foreign policy that they seem to be shocked that  American president would resist as this one has. </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, Xi Jinping for more than a decade has been dropping  hints that China is the world's only sovereign state.  And this is just --  basically what he saying is that Americans, Japanese, whatever, you know,  are just mere subjects to the greater glory of the Chinese court.  You  know, the important thing for us is that those trade that we have, you  know, our factories in China are producing profits that China is then using  to put into its military which is configuring itself to fight Americans.</p><p> And so there is a long chain here and it's not just economics, it's also of  course security because China needs an enemy and they've identified us.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, they've identified us.  We should have been too hard to spot  because we are the only superpower in the world.  This is a -- this is a  country under this president that is not recognizable to the power  structure in Beijing, is it?  </p><p>CHANG:  No.  One thing that President Trump has done especially this year  is he's taken actions to defend the American economy.  Defend the American  society.  Chinese leaders don't how to deal with it.  So they try to talk  to Henry Kissinger, they go try to talk to the heads of financial  companies.  And --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  The establishment, Wall Street -- Wall Street has been carrying out  what the Vice President referred to as lobbying exercise, calling Wall  Street and American CEOs participating in the Chinese call for discussions  and talks unregistered foreign agents.  And my god, that's exactly what  they are and kudos to the Vice President for saying it exactly the way it  is.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And you know, we saw that September 16th meeting in Beijing  before the midterms.  Obviously the Chinese were trying to use the heads of  the big financial --</p><p> DOBBS:  They still are.</p><p>CHANG:  -- against the United States and it didn't work.  And right now,  the people in Beijing are scratching their head.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  It hasn't worked so far only because the CEOs didn't take them up  on the offer.  But they dispatch their minions from the -- in some cases  from the seed level offices of their banks and firms.  You know, this is an  ugly thing we're watching.  We're watching propaganda being organized  against this President's policies.  We're watching the establishment, try  to subvert the President's policies on China on international trade.</p><p> And the idea that this stuff that has been circulating from the  establishment whether it's at the Council of Foreign Relations or it's the  Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, you know, we need quick wins here after  this -- the midterms.  The president's got a quick win.  He won the Senate  for crying out loud.  He is accomplishing more and now they want to try to  talk their way, insinuate themselves into this President's administration  and to get him to -- in some cases dilute or even abandon policies that are  -- that are certain to be effective.  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, the most important thing here is that these tariffs that  people talked about, that are imposed under Section 301 of Trade Act of  1974 as a remedy for the theft of intellectual property.  The NSA last week  just came out with a report said China's theft of U.S. I.P. for commercial  purposes has actually increased over the last year.  We saw that report a  couple days -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  When is the last time you heard one of the front companies being  shut down by either the FBI or any intelligence operation of this agency of  this country?  You haven't.  You haven't heard -- we know that for years  they have been operating, literally thousands of front companies working  through our universities as well to what?  Gather intellectual property by  the hundreds of billions of dollars they steal a -- every year.  </p><p>CHANG:  We just got that report that Micron Technology, their most recent  chip has been completely stolen by the Chinese.  That was $8.95 billion  worth of I.P., just one theft and it's occurring across the board, Lou.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And these idiots -- and I will call them what they, they're  traitors to the United States.  Every one of these people trying to reverse  this President's policies, vis-a-vis, Beijing are betraying this country  and they're doing so for the -- the most sorted of reasons and that is  their own commercial interests.  Gordon, great to see.  Thanks for being  here.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  As always.  Gordon Chang.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.   The question is, do you believe communist China finally comprehends  President Trump's America First trade policies and demand for balance to  free trade -- fair trade?  And then into China's theft of U.S. technology  is now nonnegotiable.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs as always, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p> Up next, the White House unveiling a new code of conduct for the White  House press corps.  Oh, that's going to make a few of them very  uncomfortable.  Journalists with the national left-wing media must act like  adults.  You think they can do that?  Is this a fair set of guidelines?  We  take that and more right after the break.  Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett join me.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  The White House today outlining new rules for presidential news  conference.  The White House has dropped its effort to remove the hard pass  of CNN reporter, Jim Acosta.  The rules include limiting journalists to one  question each, follow-ups at the discretion of the President.  And the  letter warn, should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will  take action.</p><p> Well, joining me now to take up all of this, the fight over the acting  attorney general and more Harmeet Dhillon, attorney, RNC Committeewoman for  the great State of California.  Great to have you with us.  Gregg Jarrett,  Fox Legal Analyst, author of the New York Times best-selling, the Russia  Hoax.  And always good to have you with us.  Harmeet, let me begin with  you.  These rules tonight and if we could let's put those up full-screen  just for a second.</p><p> These look pretty simple, straightforward, does this meet the test of due  process that Judge Kelly asserted?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC CHAIRWOMAN:  Well, it's step one in the due process.   First, you have to have the rules announced in advance and then you have to  have a warning and notice an opportunity to be heard in response.  So, I do  think it satisfies the due process and now it remains to be seen whether  Acosta is going to carry out his part which is either behaving or being  able to justify his actions.</p><p> And if he chose the line as a result of this and everybody will be better  off and, you know, we won't have anything to worry about.  But if he  doesn't or somebody else doesn't, then yes, the White House has the right  to institute proceedings, give them an opportunity to respond and then take  a final action.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Your thoughts.</p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  There have always been rules of  decency and decorum that White House correspondents have always practiced  when I was there temporarily.  I knew the rules, I abided by the rules.   Then it comes along guys like Jim Acosta.  And they think they have the  right to be rude and abrasive and obnoxious and commandeer the news  conference and argue with the President and prevent his colleagues from  posing their questions.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You have to believe that they are a little upset, the White House  press corps that he has messed it up.  </p><p> JARRETT:  Yes.  And if I were press secretary, what I would do is the next  time Acosta pulls that I would say that's the end of the news conference,  not only today but for the rest of the week.  </p><p> DOBBS:  That's what the President said he will do.</p><p> JARRETT:  And the -- his colleagues, Acosta's colleagues would have  surrounded him and threatened to tar and feather and then kick him out.   And that is the most effective --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JARRETT:  -- get rid of that kind of conduct.  You know --</p><p> DOBBS:  I mean, let's be honest here, I want to ask you both.  Why -- Isn't  there a time where you have to just tell a district court judge to go to  hell?  Because I mean, the idea that you have to follow the dicta of a  district court judge and create rules and can't run the White House that  it's been run since time (INAUDIBLE) Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, Lou, to be -- to be fair to the judge, if you read his  ruling from the bench, it seems clear that he felt that he was constrained  by a prior decision.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS: Yes, but that's (INAUDIBLE) nonsense.  That was a 1977 -- excuse me  Harmeet that was an idiot in my opinion ruling.</p><p>DHILLON:  OK.</p><p> DOBBS:  This judge took a case in which you're dealing with a nation  reporter.  It wasn't about anything but his politics, it had nothing to do  with conduct, it had nothing to do with decorum.  And disrupting a  presidential press conference, it wasn't on point at all in my opinion.   You guys are the lawyer but I mean --</p><p>DHILLON:  Right.  Well, your question -- yes, your question was should we  tell the judge to go to hell and the answer is that's generally not a good  idea.  And I do think that norms announced in advance even though they're  obvious like, you know, you shouldn't have to tell people to behave like  adults but now that we have that, well, I think it's actually a good --</p><p> DOBBS:  You shouldn't have to tell a district court judge to get back on  your -- get back on your bailiwick either, what do you think?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, on the other -- </p><p> JARRETT:  Wait, you're absolutely right.  When you are of -- there's no  freedom to be obnoxious and rude, there's no freedom of the press to  question the president.  It's a privilege to be there at the White House  and there are rules and norms that have always been followed.  And now  you've got a judge who has decided to expand due process beyond any  resemblance --</p><p> DOBBS:  He's telling the president of the United States how to conduct the  --</p><p> JARRETT:  And I agree with you, I would tell the judge go to hell.  We're  going to practice the way we want.  Let the Supreme Court decide it if  necessary.</p><p> DOBBS:  Let me turn very quickly to the president prepared to give his  written answers to Robert Mueller.  Let's take his comments to Chris  Wallace yesterday, if we could please.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The questions were asked and  answered, wasn't a big deal.  You know, they make it like I had meetings  for many, many hours.  I got the questions, I responded, we wrote them out,  I read them once, I read them a second time we made some changes, that's  it.  I think that should solve the problem.  I hope itself is a problem, if  it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time  but probably this is the end.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  There's the president Harmeet, is this the end in your best  judgment?</p><p> DHILLON:  Well, I think it should be the end from the president's side.  I  think this is handled correctly and this is the extent of his involvement  in this now.  Who knows what Mueller is going to do with this and there may  be a second round.  This may attempt to go on forever but I hope for that  this puts an end.  Arrest and this is the appropriate way to handle it,  given how busy the president is.</p><p> DOBBS:  Gregg?</p><p> JARRETT:  With obstruction off the table, it should've taken five minutes  to answer the questions.  I don't know anything about collusion, I don't  know anybody else in my campaign who knew or colluded with Russia, end of  story.  And you can dismiss allegations of the Trump Tower meeting.  Did  Trump know in advance?  I did not he said that repeatedly.  Did you mislead  anyone in your dictated statement it was accurate to the best of my  knowledge.  So, I mean, those are the main questions they should be easy to  answer.</p><p> DOBBS:  And after over two years of investigating this president and his  administration, enough is enough, it's enough.  It's actually far more than  enough.</p><p> JARRETT:  Right.</p><p> DOBBS:  Harmeet Dhillon, Gregg Jarrett thank you both for being with us  tonight, thank you.</p><p> DHILLON:  Thanks Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  Up next, after nearly two weeks, the results are settled in  Florida.  It's up two victories -- two victories for the President and the  Republicans, the Senate majority for the Republicans is growing.  We take  that up and more with the dynamic duo, Diamond and Silk joining us tonight.   Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  On Wall Street today a big sell-off.  The Dow losing almost 400  points, the S&amp;P lost 46, the NASDAQ down 219.  Volume on the big board 3.7  billion shares.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet all dropping into bear  market territory closing out the day.  Facebook's stock plummeted heading  in -- heading into 2019.  The company's stock losing five percent hitting  its lowest level since February of 2017.  Facebook on track for its longest  quarterly loss to --losing streak since 2013.  </p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook weighing in on the possibility that Congress will  regulate big tech, here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market.  But we have to admit  when the free markets not working and it hasn't worked here and I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  The president has said as much.  The president making it very clear  that he is not thrilled with monopolistic powers or the oligopolies that  have formed in technology.</p><p> A reminder listened to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.</p><p> Embattled controversial election supervisor.  A Broward CountyFlorida has  produced a suitable ending, Brenda Snipes has resigned.  Snipes facing  criticism for her failure to comply with Florida law and the 2018 midterms  after years of incompetence and skulduggery, President Trump called for her  to be fired.  Just days ago, her resignation takes effect.  Are you ready?   She's a lame-duck.  Her resignation effective in January taking a page out  of -- well, someone we all knows book.</p><p> Joining me now, social media superstars, President Trump's most loyal  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you with us.  Let me start by  asking you, will there be now national left-wing media focus on the fact  this president has achieved a terrific victory for the U.S. Senate  enlarging the GOP majority?</p><p> LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  It should  be, they should focus on that, but you know they're not.  What they will  focus on the left-wing media is start throwing the racist word around or  this is racist or somebody as being racist towards me.  I absolutely love  and I'm so thrilled that Brenda Snipe's out.  Was that she's stepping down.</p><p> ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  Yes.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  She should have been fired a long time ago.  Because if you look  at what she did in this whole process is what they were trying to do.  They  were -- they were doing a rehearsal getting prepared for the 2020 run.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  It was going to be the art of the steal and I want everybody.  I  don't care what's on the aisle you're on to look at that.  When you break  our election laws and do what you want to and not answer questions that  should be answered.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  You're trying to take something you're trying to steal but she  should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p> DOBBS:  You know governor elect DeSantis saying that there was no way that  she was going to be the election supervisor through another election.  I'm  amazed that they put up with the shenanigans and being very kind.  The  cheating and the stealing in that elections office as long as they did.</p><p> The White House press corps let's turn their, new rules.  We can call them  the -- I don't know what the Acosta rules.  I don't know what you would  want to call them, in which the whole press corps gets to ask one question,  they've got to be civil and they've got to be kind of focused on their  manners.  What do you think?</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Well, listen, I absolutely love it.  I think Acosta if he wants  to be respected as a journalist, he have to respect the White House and  respect the president.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  He's going to have to do that.  No more acting like a baby, no  more wanting to suck on your pacifier.  We're not going to put you on  timeout.  If you do, if you defy the rules --</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  -- you're going to get thrown out, not a timeout but up at that  White House and your press conditions are going to be taken again.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  So, the bottom line is this Lou, if you act like a child you  would be treated like a child, bottom line.</p><p> DOBBS:  And certainly in the presence of the President of the United States  and in the White House itself, I would think that would come as second  nature to any American.</p><p> Let me -- let me turn first to in terms of foreign policy, a president who  has introduced the entire country and all of our trading partners to an  extraordinary concept.  We're going to have balanced trade, you're not  going to steal from us by the hundreds of billions of dollars a year  anymore.  Specifically that case obviously fits China.  They're behaving  like children, they want to be able to keep stealing and they think that we  should be subsidizing their economy and buying their products no matter  what the impact is on our workers and our corporations.  Your thoughts  about the Chinese having just a bit of a fit over this insistence by the  president.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Well, they're going to have to stop having this little hissy  fit.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Because you have a new sheriff in town, its President Donald  Trump and he's a businessman and it's going to be fair and equal trade  across the board.  You're not going to steal from us and they're going to  have to get that through their head.  And President Trump is not going to  waver nor is he going to back down.  I know that they're used to dealing  with weak presidents like President Obama and the rest of them.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  Yes.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  But you have a strong president that's not going to tolerate.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  And you have a strong president that's putting American first  baby.  It's about America because charity starts at home not abroad.</p><p> DOBBS:  Thank you so much for being with us.  It's always great to see you  my friends.  Thanks so much Diamond and Silk.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Thanks for having us.</p><p> DOBBS:  All the best.  Well, Pope Francis dining with 1,500 people, poor  people in the Vatican over the weekend.  And there, he decried the plight  of the indigent.  As he addressed the crowd of Francis lamented the poor  are weeping quote, while the wealthy few feast on what injustice belongs to  all.  Injustice is the perverse root of poverty.</p><p> Up next, there could be fewer U.S. troops along our southern border with  Mexico.  Are you ready for this already?  We're hearing from a general  about troop levels.  The caravan has arrived in Tijuana.  Thousands more  expected, what is going on?  We take up these latest developments with The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese when we return.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DOBBS:  The Pentagon may begin scaling back the troops posted along our  border with Mexico as early as this week.  The army commander overseeing  the mission Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan telling Politico the  missions end date remains December 15th that all of the active duty troops  who were sent to the border could be home by Christmas despite the expected  arrival of thousands more in caravans at the southern border in the days  and weeks ahead. </p><p> According to a new poll from Monmouth University, more than half of  Americans see the migrant caravans moving toward the country as a threat to  the United States.  In the poll released today nearly a third of them see  the caravans is a major threat.  And the same poll found seven and ten  Americans see illegal immigration as a serious issue.  Joining us tonight  to discuss the caravan, Jim Acosta's new rules, and the sore losers in the  Democratic Party, the Daily Callers Editorial Director Vince Coglianese.   It's good to have you with us, Vince. </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLERS:  Nice to be here, Lou.   Thank you. </p><p> DOBBS:  Let us start with this unexpected announcement that troops may  apparently be withdrawn very quickly from the border.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes, I think -- I thought an underlying principle of the Trump  administration is that we don't broadcast our intentions with our military  ahead of time.  We have to keep people guessing for national security  reasons and that's not what's happening here.  I think what you're pointing  out is that it's a bit of a bizarre messaging to say hey the troops are  going to be away from the border by Christmas.  And if you are the -- if  you're looking to illegally immigrate into the United States, you now have  a great time lined by which to do that.  So that's -- I think that's a bit  uninspired to be giving those sorts of answers whether or not you intend to  actually do it. </p><p> DOBBS:  This lieutenant general who I haven't heard of before but that  doesn't mean anything necessarily, had to surely understand this is a  political question of great sensitivity and that he would be very wise  indeed to not speak to it without White House approval, in fact insisting I  would think for his own career that it come from the White House. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  It was clearly an issue of sincere concern of the President of  the United States so that would be my first thought too, what does the  White House think of this, the statement I'm about to make.  And I think  what you're seeing if I'm just making a prediction here holding on my  finger at the wind, it looks like the military is succumbing a bit to the  liberal media pressure on this question.  This idea -- you saw the New York  Times run this big story.  The troops are out there.  They're going to miss  holidays.  They signed up to defend our country.  They signed up for our  national security.  And one of the paramount concerns is the integrity of  our borders. </p><p> These men and women on the border doing the job they were asked to do by  their Commander-in-Chief and yet the New York Times is coming at it from  the perspective of how dare they even be a part of this and I think the  military is coming to that a little bit by broadcasting this idea that oh  don't worry, everyone will be home by Christmas.  There won't be military  on the border to assist the border patrol.  Not a good message to send when  you have so many illegal immigrants knocking on the door. </p><p> DOBBS:  No matter what, there's a serious problem in the Pentagon because  once again Mattis, the Defense Secretary is putting himself in at this  point what appears to be opposition to the Commander in Chief.  Indeed a  stunning stuff to witness.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  And General Mattis went to the border this week with Kirstjen  Nielsen this past week to actually survey the activity of the troops.  It's  nice to see him out there.  I think that's a good thing encouraging the  troops, and that's -- and that's the key here.  And look, the reason those  troops are on the border is to assist the Border Patrol in its very tall  task.  I mean, you look at this migrant caravan that's standing in Tijuana  right now, that is not even the start of it.  Think back to October.  You  know this really well, Lou.  Nearly 60,000 people were arrested or turned  back at the border with the United States in Mexico.  That's a record.  And  that means that this migrant crisis is continuing every day.  Caravans,  forget caravans.  We have a caravan coming every day into the United States  of America. </p><p> DOBBS:  And let me turn to the White House since we're on that subject, and  that is the new rules announced by Sarah Sanders today, the new rules for  journalists in the White House press corps. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p> DOBBS:  One question, you know, behave yourself, we'll see how things go is  my summation.  Your reaction to these new Acosta rules. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Look, that's the key.  That's the key right there.  This is  Jim Acosta's fault.  The reality is, if you're a member of that press  corps, if you're in that White House press briefing room, yes, of course,  you're standing up alongside your fellow reporter arguing for the most  amount of times ask questions that you can possibly get.  But here's the  key.  Jim Acosta, by virtue of the debate he held with the President of the  United States, not questioning a debate.  He started to -- he started out  by saying he wanted to challenge the President on a talking point.  That's  not the role.  </p><p> The role is to get information out of the president for the American people  and he failed in that core test.  And in so doing, he made it worse for the  entire press corps because now they have restrictive rules on their ability  to ask follow-up questions, all courtesy of one man Jim Acosta. </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, one man and one organization.  Then you go to Jeff Zucker at  CNN, then you go to the parent Time-Warner, and then you go to the parent  of the parent which is AT&amp;T.  And the reality is we're watching corporate  behemoth direct the conduct that of a Jim Acosta.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p> DOBBS:  There's a purpose in it and no one should mistake that.  We're  watching Comcast when it comes to NBC.  I mean, it goes on and on.  These  are corporate, corporate journalists behaving that way.  Obviously at the  direction of their corporations. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, if you want you want to do something fun or if your  viewers ever want to basically take a look at like how that White House  press briefing room was actually composed and who gets paid by whom in that  room, look no further than the first couple rows.  Fox has a couple of  reporters by virtue of Fox News radio and Fox News and Fox Business, of  course.  But those are individual networks.  What you have in that room are  Washington Post reporters, New York Times reporters.  The first couple  rows, they're all paid by CNN and MSNBC.  They're paid contributors to  those networks.  In other words, those two lefty networks have control, are  paying a huge percentage of the major figures who were that press briefing.   That is a very real conflict of interest. </p><p> DOBBS:  Conflict of interest and one you would think that the White House  would want to examine very carefully.  You know, the issue of Acosta, the  CNN, you know, I just have to think that the White House press corps is  beside itself with these rules coming down all because of the way Acosta  behaved and you know, did so with you know, I mean it just doesn't make any  sense to me. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Unquestionably.  But one of the lessons I take from this is  like the seething hatred for the Trump White House must be so great in that  room that they're willing to tolerate the insanity of Jim Acosta which  strikes me as the most bizarre thing ever.  At some point, they have to tap  out in the go, you know what, Jim Acosta, you are poorly serving our  ability to actually ask questions of the White House. </p><p> DOBBS:  And I don't suppose that would be possibly a part of the White  House strategy to make certain that they become self-policing and self- aware.  Vince Coglianese, great to have you with us.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Thank you, Lou. </p><p> DOBBS:  Up next, more on the migrant Caravan as they find out what happens  in Tijuana, the Mexican people weren't too thrilled with them and they are  the ones protesting illegal immigrants not on this side of the border.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Last week we asked you if you believe President Trump's border wall  will ever be built?  67 percent of you said yes, and the rest, no.  Well,  here's where we are tonight, what we're looking at tomorrow.  The migrant  caravan in Tijuana now is facing such opposition from angry local residents  there reporting this fights in rocks hurl.  The Department of Homeland  Security also says at least 500 people, 500 of them criminals have been  identified within the caravan.  </p><p> Brenda Snipes, the Broward County Florida election supervisor is -- she's  submitted her resignation.  Over the last two weeks she's been responsible  for misplacing if you will, 2,000 ballots, counting those ballots, mixing  invalid ballots with good ones, failing to meet a deadline with machine  recount results altering the outcome of course of the recount, and in fact,  disqualifying it. </p><p> That's it for us tonight.  Tomorrow night, please be with us.  We'll see  you then.  Good night from New York. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Guys, I love this squad over there.  Thank you for watching.   Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network.  Have a good  night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good evening, everybody.  Our top  stories, tensions between the United States and China escalating as  President Trump and his administration insist on America First foreign  policy that includes fair trade, balance trade and respect for the U.S. and  U.S. property throughout the world.  China's president Xi Jinping and Vice  President Mike Pence delivered dueling speeches in Asia over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presenting two very different views of global trade and security.  We take  that up, we discuss the latest in the U.S.-China relationship.  China  expert Gordon Chang with us.  Also tonight, more in rest in Tijuana as  Central American migrants are clashing with hundreds of local Mexican  residents who don't want them in their city.  President Trump remaining  steadfast in his commitment to strong borders warning those in the caravan  not to try to enter, not to try to enter the United States illegally.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're not letting people in  to our country illegally.  And we're not doing a release.  We'll do a catch  but we're not doing releases.  So, if they think they're going to be  released into our country like in the old days, like for years and years  they catch and release, we're not releasing.  They don't get released.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We take up the latest in the situation south of our border.  Fox  Reporter William La Jeunesse, is reporting tonight from Tijuana and The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese join us.  In California, 80 are dead,  nearly 1000 people are still missing as the deadliest fire in the state's  history continue to burn ahead of an expected rainstorm.  We'll have the  latest from California, tonight.</p><p>Our top story, drop in the shares of Apple.  Another big tech fueling a big  selloff on Wall Street today.  The Dow Jones Industrial is down almost 400  points.  The S&amp;P 500 down 46, the NASDAQ lost more than 200 points.  And  amidst of the market turmoil, the White House continuing to demand fair  trade policies from China ahead of an upcoming meeting that will take place  between the President and Xi Jinping at the end of this month.</p><p>Edward Lawrence in Washington with the story.  Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Lou.  Trade fair is  part of that market drop.  The breaking news tonight, the state department  spokeswoman reacted to harsh language by the Chinese without mentioning  China following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  Now, the  statement tonight reads, the United States is proud to agree to promote  free and fair trade in the region and combat unfair trade practices.</p><p>It is unfortunate that not all economies despite their rhetoric could  support these positions.  And the cooperation summit fail to issue a joint  statement for the first time in 29 years.  The China blames the U.S. for  spoiling the summit.  A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying,  it seem like the U.S. attended this APEC meeting with great anger.   Speeches and remarks at the meeting openly cause controversy, created  discourse, spilling the atmosphere -- or spoiling the atmosphere of the  meeting and did not contribute to achieving consensus.</p><p>Well, the Vice President brief the President today.  This summit seem to  escalate the trade dispute towards a trade war as China continues with  their trading practices.  They are not changing.  The Chinese delegation  led Vice-Premier supposed to meet in Washington this week, they canceled  again.  These were prep talks related to the G27 Summit bilateral meeting  between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Chinese say the meeting will happen after the bilateral on December  1st, assuming it goes well.  Now, former FTC Chairman under President  Reagan says, China should not underestimate President Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DANIEL OLIVER, FORMER FTC CHAIRMAN:  Trump is a very good negotiator.  He  negotiated with the Canadians and I think the Chinese should take a look at  how we negotiated with the Canadians and get ready for more.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the Vice President told the Chinese the U.S. will not change  course unless China changes their trading practices.  The market reflected  that in part with this hardening to -- part of the hardening tone with the  selloff.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Edward, thanks so much.  It's hard some days to tell whether it's  hardening or whether it's just an awakening on the part of the Chinese to  the fact that this president means business.  </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Yes.  And resetting those for fair trade deals.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.  And international economic order in need of  rebalancing across the entire breath of those relationships.  Edward, thank  you very much.  Edward Lawrence reporting from Washington.  On the U.S.  Southern border tonight, Homeland Security officials say the caravan of  Central American migrants consisting of nearly all single adult or teen  males and that at least 500 criminals have been identified among the ranks.</p><p>There are now about 6000 migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico.  That  is from the United States with thousands more expected to arrive behind  them over the coming days.  But as Correspondent William La Jeunesse now  reports.  They aren't receiving a warm welcome at all from the locals.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou, as you  know, illegal immigration is not new to Mexico.  Generations of Central  Americans have used this country as a steppingstone to the United States.   But this caravan, how they cross the numbers seem to have awakened a silent  now vocal minority against them.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JEUNESSE:  Tension in Tijuana.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here because our government has not taken  control of these what we call invasions.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  Shouting, Hondurans go home and viva Mexico.  Riot police Sunday  stopped hundreds of Mexicans trying to storm the migrant shelter.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see people within the migrant caravan smoking weed,  drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  These Mexicans oppose illegal immigration and blame officials  for allowing in thousands without papers.  They fear crime, a loss of jobs,  depressed wages in a country where 40 percent already live in poverty.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not in favor of them coming the way they did.  You  know, to me, if feels like they invaded.</p><p>JEUNESSE:  Nearby, a counter protest supporters say Mexico should welcome  and protect immigrants.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's important that we consider that our Mexican  brothers are also in the same situation.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  The shelter Sunday remained on lockdown until protesters went  home.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There here for work, to have a better life and no  troubles.  Not troublemakers.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  More than 6000 caravan migrants arrived in Tijuana.  Their  shelter looking now like a refugee camp as many realize they cannot easily  cross the border and any asylum interviews is at least five weeks away.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I tell them it's better for you to get a job and it's  not working right.  And then (INAUDIBLE) trying to cross the border.</p><p>JEUNESSE:  This morning for the first time, the U.S. shut down the San  Ysidro Port of Entry.  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen saying in a tweet, CPB  believe a \"large number of caravan migrants plants to rush the border to  gain illegal access to the U.S\". </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JEUNESSE:  So by shutting down lanes and slowing traffic and increasing  wait times, President Trump is sending a message to Mexico City that if you  fail to stop these on your southern border you face consequences on the  northern one.  And Lou, he's doing it in a language that everyone  understands, time is money.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  William, thank you very much.  William La Jeunesse reporting from  the San Ysidro Port of Entry.  Rain headed for Northern California this  week.  Welcome rain bringing conditions that could both help and hinder  efforts to put up the deadly campfire which has left at least 77 people  dead.  Correspondent Claudia Cowan has the latest tonight from Chico,  California.  </p><p>HAROLD SCHAPELHOUMAN, FIRE CHIEF, MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA:  It's a grim task  but it's necessary.  It really does, you know, help families out because it  allows them know what happened, as difficult as it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The flames may have slowed but the  recovery from the devastating California wildfires still in its early  stages with the death toll growing each day and the number of people  unaccounted for constantly fluctuating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do this.</p><p>COWAN:  Now, search crews are in a race against mother nature with rain in  the forecast.  While it will help put out the fire and improve air quality,  rain could trigger mud slides and wash away the remains of those who died  in the fire.</p><p>MIKE MOHLER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION:  The  weather that's expected is definitely going to impact operations.  It's a - - especially during the recovery.  I'm working with the Sheriff's  Department and first responders.  Again, we have additional resources out  there really trying to work ahead of these storms.  </p><p>COWAN:  With more than 50000 left homeless by the campfire, thousands are  streaming through a disaster relief center trying to get their lives back  together.  </p><p>KEVIN HANNES, FEDERAL COOPERATING OFFICER, FEMA:  They can get initial  financial support from FEMA if they qualified for Federal assistance.  They  can get information, they can get their drivers license renewed, they can  update their mailing address with the postal service.  Social Security  cards can be issued here.  </p><p>COWAN:  An emotional vigil on Sunday night in Chico, California where the  community came together to heal and share stories of their escape.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were basically a moving bomb because we had a bunch  of propane tanks.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was leaves falling down on fire on top of us.   Propane tanks blowing it up.  It was -- it was like a war zone.  </p><p>COWAN:  Joe Florence (ph) and his family are thankful they made it out in  time.  And also for President Trump's visit here on Saturday.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm grateful for all the support that he's given us.   He didn't have to come here the way California (INAUDIBLE) and for that I'm  very grateful.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COWAN:  And the Federal aid that the President promised to help this  community promised to help this community recover is flowing.  More than  $3-1/2 million is already in the hands of 13,000 households that have  registered with FEMA here in Butte County.  Those numbers will certainly  grow.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Claudia, thank you very much.  Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico,  California.  Still ahead here tonight, the White House has set new rules of  conduct for journalists as the national left-wing media continues to attack  President Trump rather than Jim Acosta's conduct.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jim Acosta's fight for press freedom resulted in a  resounding victory for the first amendment.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The system worked tax and balances worked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Having the press in the White House is actually more of  it benefits the White House.  So maybe the Trump administration is a little  worried about cutting off that tool.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a about a slippery slope.  This is about what  other reporters can be talking about this White House.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't even think Donald Trump understands the  definition of decorum.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are watching the radioholic president at a point of  his greatest rage and who it's at and his greatest rage is at the press.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll take that up with attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett.  But up next, new science that tariffs on Chinese exports to the  United States are working and working very well.  Asia expert Gordon Chang  joins me to talk about the President's winning strategy and the threat of  communist China when we continue.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A new report that demonstrates clearly President Trump is  succeeding in making China pay for most of the trade tariffs.  European  researchers now saying American consumers and companies are absorbing only  4-1/2 percent of those tariffs of the 25 percent imposed on $250 billion of  Chinese goods.  The remaining 80 percent of those tariffs are being paid by  China.  And joining me now to talk about the very tense U.S.-China  relationship and one that doesn't seem to be improving, Gordon Chang.</p><p>Author of the Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown.  Gordon,  good to have you here.  And welcome back from Tokyo.  Good to -- good to  see you.  But let's start with first these targeted tariffs that the  President has implemented and more to follow if the Chinese do not come to  their senses.  I mean, this has to shock places like Goldman Sachs and the  establishment forces that have been lobbying and against these tariffs.   Your thoughts?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST:  All the smart people who talks about how  the American consumer was going to be the one paying for all the tariffs.   Well, they are wrong and this is because the administration obviously  picked out those areas where there was a lot of elasticity and that's good.   You know, the important thing is that --</p><p>DOBBS:  There goes Gordon using economics where I was just saying today,  very few people talk about the elasticity that is the ability to substitute  goods or to delay purchasing based on price.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  The important thing here is that when you look at the broader  picture of the tariffs and the other things that the Trump administration  is doing he is actually encouraging supply chains to get out of China.  And  that's important for us because those supply chains are held hostage by  Beijing.  Whenever they get upset about something and it's often not about  trade, they go against our companies.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And sometimes we use the word -- the word supply chain are used too  liberally when the word really is production of products themselves in  China.  And a dependence upon China for that production.  That's got to  change obviously as you say.  Some other things have got to change.  One is  it's a communist government, they have expansionist and that's being kind.   They have -- they have colonial it seems at times but certainly imperial --  imperatives within their foreign policy that they seem to be shocked that  American president would resist as this one has. </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, Xi Jinping for more than a decade has been dropping  hints that China is the world's only sovereign state.  And this is just --  basically what he saying is that Americans, Japanese, whatever, you know,  are just mere subjects to the greater glory of the Chinese court.  You  know, the important thing for us is that those trade that we have, you  know, our factories in China are producing profits that China is then using  to put into its military which is configuring itself to fight Americans.</p><p>And so there is a long chain here and it's not just economics, it's also of  course security because China needs an enemy and they've identified us.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, they've identified us.  We should have been too hard to spot  because we are the only superpower in the world.  This is a -- this is a  country under this president that is not recognizable to the power  structure in Beijing, is it?  </p><p>CHANG:  No.  One thing that President Trump has done especially this year  is he's taken actions to defend the American economy.  Defend the American  society.  Chinese leaders don't how to deal with it.  So they try to talk  to Henry Kissinger, they go try to talk to the heads of financial  companies.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The establishment, Wall Street -- Wall Street has been carrying out  what the Vice President referred to as lobbying exercise, calling Wall  Street and American CEOs participating in the Chinese call for discussions  and talks unregistered foreign agents.  And my god, that's exactly what  they are and kudos to the Vice President for saying it exactly the way it  is.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And you know, we saw that September 16th meeting in Beijing  before the midterms.  Obviously the Chinese were trying to use the heads of  the big financial --</p><p>DOBBS:  They still are.</p><p>CHANG:  -- against the United States and it didn't work.  And right now,  the people in Beijing are scratching their head.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  It hasn't worked so far only because the CEOs didn't take them up  on the offer.  But they dispatch their minions from the -- in some cases  from the seed level offices of their banks and firms.  You know, this is an  ugly thing we're watching.  We're watching propaganda being organized  against this President's policies.  We're watching the establishment, try  to subvert the President's policies on China on international trade.</p><p>And the idea that this stuff that has been circulating from the  establishment whether it's at the Council of Foreign Relations or it's the  Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, you know, we need quick wins here after  this -- the midterms.  The president's got a quick win.  He won the Senate  for crying out loud.  He is accomplishing more and now they want to try to  talk their way, insinuate themselves into this President's administration  and to get him to -- in some cases dilute or even abandon policies that are  -- that are certain to be effective.  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, the most important thing here is that these tariffs that  people talked about, that are imposed under Section 301 of Trade Act of  1974 as a remedy for the theft of intellectual property.  The NSA last week  just came out with a report said China's theft of U.S. I.P. for commercial  purposes has actually increased over the last year.  We saw that report a  couple days -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  When is the last time you heard one of the front companies being  shut down by either the FBI or any intelligence operation of this agency of  this country?  You haven't.  You haven't heard -- we know that for years  they have been operating, literally thousands of front companies working  through our universities as well to what?  Gather intellectual property by  the hundreds of billions of dollars they steal a -- every year.  </p><p>CHANG:  We just got that report that Micron Technology, their most recent  chip has been completely stolen by the Chinese.  That was $8.95 billion  worth of I.P., just one theft and it's occurring across the board, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And these idiots -- and I will call them what they, they're  traitors to the United States.  Every one of these people trying to reverse  this President's policies, vis-a-vis, Beijing are betraying this country  and they're doing so for the -- the most sorted of reasons and that is  their own commercial interests.  Gordon, great to see.  Thanks for being  here.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  As always.  Gordon Chang.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.   The question is, do you believe communist China finally comprehends  President Trump's America First trade policies and demand for balance to  free trade -- fair trade?  And then into China's theft of U.S. technology  is now nonnegotiable.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs as always, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, the White House unveiling a new code of conduct for the White  House press corps.  Oh, that's going to make a few of them very  uncomfortable.  Journalists with the national left-wing media must act like  adults.  You think they can do that?  Is this a fair set of guidelines?  We  take that and more right after the break.  Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett join me.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The White House today outlining new rules for presidential news  conference.  The White House has dropped its effort to remove the hard pass  of CNN reporter, Jim Acosta.  The rules include limiting journalists to one  question each, follow-ups at the discretion of the President.  And the  letter warn, should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will  take action.</p><p>Well, joining me now to take up all of this, the fight over the acting  attorney general and more Harmeet Dhillon, attorney, RNC Committeewoman for  the great State of California.  Great to have you with us.  Gregg Jarrett,  Fox Legal Analyst, author of the New York Times best-selling, the Russia  Hoax.  And always good to have you with us.  Harmeet, let me begin with  you.  These rules tonight and if we could let's put those up full-screen  just for a second.</p><p>These look pretty simple, straightforward, does this meet the test of due  process that Judge Kelly asserted?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC CHAIRWOMAN:  Well, it's step one in the due process.   First, you have to have the rules announced in advance and then you have to  have a warning and notice an opportunity to be heard in response.  So, I do  think it satisfies the due process and now it remains to be seen whether  Acosta is going to carry out his part which is either behaving or being  able to justify his actions.</p><p>And if he chose the line as a result of this and everybody will be better  off and, you know, we won't have anything to worry about.  But if he  doesn't or somebody else doesn't, then yes, the White House has the right  to institute proceedings, give them an opportunity to respond and then take  a final action.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Your thoughts.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  There have always been rules of  decency and decorum that White House correspondents have always practiced  when I was there temporarily.  I knew the rules, I abided by the rules.   Then it comes along guys like Jim Acosta.  And they think they have the  right to be rude and abrasive and obnoxious and commandeer the news  conference and argue with the President and prevent his colleagues from  posing their questions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You have to believe that they are a little upset, the White House  press corps that he has messed it up.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Yes.  And if I were press secretary, what I would do is the next  time Acosta pulls that I would say that's the end of the news conference,  not only today but for the rest of the week.  </p><p>DOBBS:  That's what the President said he will do.</p><p>JARRETT:  And the -- his colleagues, Acosta's colleagues would have  surrounded him and threatened to tar and feather and then kick him out.   And that is the most effective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  -- get rid of that kind of conduct.  You know --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, let's be honest here, I want to ask you both.  Why -- Isn't  there a time where you have to just tell a district court judge to go to  hell?  Because I mean, the idea that you have to follow the dicta of a  district court judge and create rules and can't run the White House that  it's been run since time (INAUDIBLE) Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, Lou, to be -- to be fair to the judge, if you read his  ruling from the bench, it seems clear that he felt that he was constrained  by a prior decision.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, but that's (INAUDIBLE) nonsense.  That was a 1977 -- excuse me  Harmeet that was an idiot in my opinion ruling.</p><p>DHILLON:  OK.</p><p>DOBBS:  This judge took a case in which you're dealing with a nation  reporter.  It wasn't about anything but his politics, it had nothing to do  with conduct, it had nothing to do with decorum.  And disrupting a  presidential press conference, it wasn't on point at all in my opinion.   You guys are the lawyer but I mean --</p><p>DHILLON:  Right.  Well, your question -- yes, your question was should we  tell the judge to go to hell and the answer is that's generally not a good  idea.  And I do think that norms announced in advance even though they're  obvious like, you know, you shouldn't have to tell people to behave like  adults but now that we have that, well, I think it's actually a good --</p><p>DOBBS:  You shouldn't have to tell a district court judge to get back on  your -- get back on your bailiwick either, what do you think?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, on the other -- </p><p>JARRETT:  Wait, you're absolutely right.  When you are of -- there's no  freedom to be obnoxious and rude, there's no freedom of the press to  question the president.  It's a privilege to be there at the White House  and there are rules and norms that have always been followed.  And now  you've got a judge who has decided to expand due process beyond any  resemblance --</p><p>DOBBS:  He's telling the president of the United States how to conduct the  --</p><p>JARRETT:  And I agree with you, I would tell the judge go to hell.  We're  going to practice the way we want.  Let the Supreme Court decide it if  necessary.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me turn very quickly to the president prepared to give his  written answers to Robert Mueller.  Let's take his comments to Chris  Wallace yesterday, if we could please.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The questions were asked and  answered, wasn't a big deal.  You know, they make it like I had meetings  for many, many hours.  I got the questions, I responded, we wrote them out,  I read them once, I read them a second time we made some changes, that's  it.  I think that should solve the problem.  I hope itself is a problem, if  it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time  but probably this is the end.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  There's the president Harmeet, is this the end in your best  judgment?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I think it should be the end from the president's side.  I  think this is handled correctly and this is the extent of his involvement  in this now.  Who knows what Mueller is going to do with this and there may  be a second round.  This may attempt to go on forever but I hope for that  this puts an end.  Arrest and this is the appropriate way to handle it,  given how busy the president is.</p><p>DOBBS:  Gregg?</p><p>JARRETT:  With obstruction off the table, it should've taken five minutes  to answer the questions.  I don't know anything about collusion, I don't  know anybody else in my campaign who knew or colluded with Russia, end of  story.  And you can dismiss allegations of the Trump Tower meeting.  Did  Trump know in advance?  I did not he said that repeatedly.  Did you mislead  anyone in your dictated statement it was accurate to the best of my  knowledge.  So, I mean, those are the main questions they should be easy to  answer.</p><p>DOBBS:  And after over two years of investigating this president and his  administration, enough is enough, it's enough.  It's actually far more than  enough.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Harmeet Dhillon, Gregg Jarrett thank you both for being with us  tonight, thank you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, after nearly two weeks, the results are settled in  Florida.  It's up two victories -- two victories for the President and the  Republicans, the Senate majority for the Republicans is growing.  We take  that up and more with the dynamic duo, Diamond and Silk joining us tonight.   Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  On Wall Street today a big sell-off.  The Dow losing almost 400  points, the S&amp;P lost 46, the NASDAQ down 219.  Volume on the big board 3.7  billion shares.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet all dropping into bear  market territory closing out the day.  Facebook's stock plummeted heading  in -- heading into 2019.  The company's stock losing five percent hitting  its lowest level since February of 2017.  Facebook on track for its longest  quarterly loss to --losing streak since 2013.  </p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook weighing in on the possibility that Congress will  regulate big tech, here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market.  But we have to admit  when the free markets not working and it hasn't worked here and I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  The president has said as much.  The president making it very clear  that he is not thrilled with monopolistic powers or the oligopolies that  have formed in technology.</p><p>A reminder listened to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Embattled controversial election supervisor.  A Broward CountyFlorida has  produced a suitable ending, Brenda Snipes has resigned.  Snipes facing  criticism for her failure to comply with Florida law and the 2018 midterms  after years of incompetence and skulduggery, President Trump called for her  to be fired.  Just days ago, her resignation takes effect.  Are you ready?   She's a lame-duck.  Her resignation effective in January taking a page out  of -- well, someone we all knows book.</p><p>Joining me now, social media superstars, President Trump's most loyal  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you with us.  Let me start by  asking you, will there be now national left-wing media focus on the fact  this president has achieved a terrific victory for the U.S. Senate  enlarging the GOP majority?</p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  It should  be, they should focus on that, but you know they're not.  What they will  focus on the left-wing media is start throwing the racist word around or  this is racist or somebody as being racist towards me.  I absolutely love  and I'm so thrilled that Brenda Snipe's out.  Was that she's stepping down.</p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  She should have been fired a long time ago.  Because if you look  at what she did in this whole process is what they were trying to do.  They  were -- they were doing a rehearsal getting prepared for the 2020 run.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  It was going to be the art of the steal and I want everybody.  I  don't care what's on the aisle you're on to look at that.  When you break  our election laws and do what you want to and not answer questions that  should be answered.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  You're trying to take something you're trying to steal but she  should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know governor elect DeSantis saying that there was no way that  she was going to be the election supervisor through another election.  I'm  amazed that they put up with the shenanigans and being very kind.  The  cheating and the stealing in that elections office as long as they did.</p><p>The White House press corps let's turn their, new rules.  We can call them  the -- I don't know what the Acosta rules.  I don't know what you would  want to call them, in which the whole press corps gets to ask one question,  they've got to be civil and they've got to be kind of focused on their  manners.  What do you think?</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, listen, I absolutely love it.  I think Acosta if he wants  to be respected as a journalist, he have to respect the White House and  respect the president.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  He's going to have to do that.  No more acting like a baby, no  more wanting to suck on your pacifier.  We're not going to put you on  timeout.  If you do, if you defy the rules --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  -- you're going to get thrown out, not a timeout but up at that  White House and your press conditions are going to be taken again.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  So, the bottom line is this Lou, if you act like a child you  would be treated like a child, bottom line.</p><p>DOBBS:  And certainly in the presence of the President of the United States  and in the White House itself, I would think that would come as second  nature to any American.</p><p>Let me -- let me turn first to in terms of foreign policy, a president who  has introduced the entire country and all of our trading partners to an  extraordinary concept.  We're going to have balanced trade, you're not  going to steal from us by the hundreds of billions of dollars a year  anymore.  Specifically that case obviously fits China.  They're behaving  like children, they want to be able to keep stealing and they think that we  should be subsidizing their economy and buying their products no matter  what the impact is on our workers and our corporations.  Your thoughts  about the Chinese having just a bit of a fit over this insistence by the  president.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, they're going to have to stop having this little hissy  fit.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Because you have a new sheriff in town, its President Donald  Trump and he's a businessman and it's going to be fair and equal trade  across the board.  You're not going to steal from us and they're going to  have to get that through their head.  And President Trump is not going to  waver nor is he going to back down.  I know that they're used to dealing  with weak presidents like President Obama and the rest of them.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  But you have a strong president that's not going to tolerate.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  And you have a strong president that's putting American first  baby.  It's about America because charity starts at home not abroad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you so much for being with us.  It's always great to see you  my friends.  Thanks so much Diamond and Silk.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>DOBBS:  All the best.  Well, Pope Francis dining with 1,500 people, poor  people in the Vatican over the weekend.  And there, he decried the plight  of the indigent.  As he addressed the crowd of Francis lamented the poor  are weeping quote, while the wealthy few feast on what injustice belongs to  all.  Injustice is the perverse root of poverty.</p><p>Up next, there could be fewer U.S. troops along our southern border with  Mexico.  Are you ready for this already?  We're hearing from a general  about troop levels.  The caravan has arrived in Tijuana.  Thousands more  expected, what is going on?  We take up these latest developments with The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese when we return.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  The Pentagon may begin scaling back the troops posted along our  border with Mexico as early as this week.  The army commander overseeing  the mission Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan telling Politico the  missions end date remains December 15th that all of the active duty troops  who were sent to the border could be home by Christmas despite the expected  arrival of thousands more in caravans at the southern border in the days  and weeks ahead. </p><p>According to a new poll from Monmouth University, more than half of  Americans see the migrant caravans moving toward the country as a threat to  the United States.  In the poll released today nearly a third of them see  the caravans is a major threat.  And the same poll found seven and ten  Americans see illegal immigration as a serious issue.  Joining us tonight  to discuss the caravan, Jim Acosta's new rules, and the sore losers in the  Democratic Party, the Daily Callers Editorial Director Vince Coglianese.   It's good to have you with us, Vince. </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLERS:  Nice to be here, Lou.   Thank you. </p><p>DOBBS:  Let us start with this unexpected announcement that troops may  apparently be withdrawn very quickly from the border.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes, I think -- I thought an underlying principle of the Trump  administration is that we don't broadcast our intentions with our military  ahead of time.  We have to keep people guessing for national security  reasons and that's not what's happening here.  I think what you're pointing  out is that it's a bit of a bizarre messaging to say hey the troops are  going to be away from the border by Christmas.  And if you are the -- if  you're looking to illegally immigrate into the United States, you now have  a great time lined by which to do that.  So that's -- I think that's a bit  uninspired to be giving those sorts of answers whether or not you intend to  actually do it. </p><p>DOBBS:  This lieutenant general who I haven't heard of before but that  doesn't mean anything necessarily, had to surely understand this is a  political question of great sensitivity and that he would be very wise  indeed to not speak to it without White House approval, in fact insisting I  would think for his own career that it come from the White House. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  It was clearly an issue of sincere concern of the President of  the United States so that would be my first thought too, what does the  White House think of this, the statement I'm about to make.  And I think  what you're seeing if I'm just making a prediction here holding on my  finger at the wind, it looks like the military is succumbing a bit to the  liberal media pressure on this question.  This idea -- you saw the New York  Times run this big story.  The troops are out there.  They're going to miss  holidays.  They signed up to defend our country.  They signed up for our  national security.  And one of the paramount concerns is the integrity of  our borders. </p><p>These men and women on the border doing the job they were asked to do by  their Commander-in-Chief and yet the New York Times is coming at it from  the perspective of how dare they even be a part of this and I think the  military is coming to that a little bit by broadcasting this idea that oh  don't worry, everyone will be home by Christmas.  There won't be military  on the border to assist the border patrol.  Not a good message to send when  you have so many illegal immigrants knocking on the door. </p><p>DOBBS:  No matter what, there's a serious problem in the Pentagon because  once again Mattis, the Defense Secretary is putting himself in at this  point what appears to be opposition to the Commander in Chief.  Indeed a  stunning stuff to witness.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  And General Mattis went to the border this week with Kirstjen  Nielsen this past week to actually survey the activity of the troops.  It's  nice to see him out there.  I think that's a good thing encouraging the  troops, and that's -- and that's the key here.  And look, the reason those  troops are on the border is to assist the Border Patrol in its very tall  task.  I mean, you look at this migrant caravan that's standing in Tijuana  right now, that is not even the start of it.  Think back to October.  You  know this really well, Lou.  Nearly 60,000 people were arrested or turned  back at the border with the United States in Mexico.  That's a record.  And  that means that this migrant crisis is continuing every day.  Caravans,  forget caravans.  We have a caravan coming every day into the United States  of America. </p><p>DOBBS:  And let me turn to the White House since we're on that subject, and  that is the new rules announced by Sarah Sanders today, the new rules for  journalists in the White House press corps. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  One question, you know, behave yourself, we'll see how things go is  my summation.  Your reaction to these new Acosta rules. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Look, that's the key.  That's the key right there.  This is  Jim Acosta's fault.  The reality is, if you're a member of that press  corps, if you're in that White House press briefing room, yes, of course,  you're standing up alongside your fellow reporter arguing for the most  amount of times ask questions that you can possibly get.  But here's the  key.  Jim Acosta, by virtue of the debate he held with the President of the  United States, not questioning a debate.  He started to -- he started out  by saying he wanted to challenge the President on a talking point.  That's  not the role.  </p><p>The role is to get information out of the president for the American people  and he failed in that core test.  And in so doing, he made it worse for the  entire press corps because now they have restrictive rules on their ability  to ask follow-up questions, all courtesy of one man Jim Acosta. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, one man and one organization.  Then you go to Jeff Zucker at  CNN, then you go to the parent Time-Warner, and then you go to the parent  of the parent which is AT&amp;T.  And the reality is we're watching corporate  behemoth direct the conduct that of a Jim Acosta.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  There's a purpose in it and no one should mistake that.  We're  watching Comcast when it comes to NBC.  I mean, it goes on and on.  These  are corporate, corporate journalists behaving that way.  Obviously at the  direction of their corporations. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, if you want you want to do something fun or if your  viewers ever want to basically take a look at like how that White House  press briefing room was actually composed and who gets paid by whom in that  room, look no further than the first couple rows.  Fox has a couple of  reporters by virtue of Fox News radio and Fox News and Fox Business, of  course.  But those are individual networks.  What you have in that room are  Washington Post reporters, New York Times reporters.  The first couple  rows, they're all paid by CNN and MSNBC.  They're paid contributors to  those networks.  In other words, those two lefty networks have control, are  paying a huge percentage of the major figures who were that press briefing.   That is a very real conflict of interest. </p><p>DOBBS:  Conflict of interest and one you would think that the White House  would want to examine very carefully.  You know, the issue of Acosta, the  CNN, you know, I just have to think that the White House press corps is  beside itself with these rules coming down all because of the way Acosta  behaved and you know, did so with you know, I mean it just doesn't make any  sense to me. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Unquestionably.  But one of the lessons I take from this is  like the seething hatred for the Trump White House must be so great in that  room that they're willing to tolerate the insanity of Jim Acosta which  strikes me as the most bizarre thing ever.  At some point, they have to tap  out in the go, you know what, Jim Acosta, you are poorly serving our  ability to actually ask questions of the White House. </p><p>DOBBS:  And I don't suppose that would be possibly a part of the White  House strategy to make certain that they become self-policing and self- aware.  Vince Coglianese, great to have you with us.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Thank you, Lou. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the migrant Caravan as they find out what happens  in Tijuana, the Mexican people weren't too thrilled with them and they are  the ones protesting illegal immigrants not on this side of the border.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Last week we asked you if you believe President Trump's border wall  will ever be built?  67 percent of you said yes, and the rest, no.  Well,  here's where we are tonight, what we're looking at tomorrow.  The migrant  caravan in Tijuana now is facing such opposition from angry local residents  there reporting this fights in rocks hurl.  The Department of Homeland  Security also says at least 500 people, 500 of them criminals have been  identified within the caravan.  </p><p>Brenda Snipes, the Broward County Florida election supervisor is -- she's  submitted her resignation.  Over the last two weeks she's been responsible  for misplacing if you will, 2,000 ballots, counting those ballots, mixing  invalid ballots with good ones, failing to meet a deadline with machine  recount results altering the outcome of course of the recount, and in fact,  disqualifying it. </p><p>That's it for us tonight.  Tomorrow night, please be with us.  We'll see  you then.  Good night from New York. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Guys, I love this squad over there.  Thank you for watching.   Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network.  Have a good  night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good evening, everybody.  Our top  stories, tensions between the United States and China escalating as  President Trump and his administration insist on America First foreign  policy that includes fair trade, balance trade and respect for the U.S. and  U.S. property throughout the world.  China's president Xi Jinping and Vice  President Mike Pence delivered dueling speeches in Asia over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Presenting two very different views of global trade and security.  We take  that up, we discuss the latest in the U.S.-China relationship.  China  expert Gordon Chang with us.  Also tonight, more in rest in Tijuana as  Central American migrants are clashing with hundreds of local Mexican  residents who don't want them in their city.  President Trump remaining  steadfast in his commitment to strong borders warning those in the caravan  not to try to enter, not to try to enter the United States illegally.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're not letting people in  to our country illegally.  And we're not doing a release.  We'll do a catch  but we're not doing releases.  So, if they think they're going to be  released into our country like in the old days, like for years and years  they catch and release, we're not releasing.  They don't get released.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We take up the latest in the situation south of our border.  Fox  Reporter William La Jeunesse, is reporting tonight from Tijuana and The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese join us.  In California, 80 are dead,  nearly 1000 people are still missing as the deadliest fire in the state's  history continue to burn ahead of an expected rainstorm.  We'll have the  latest from California, tonight.</p><p> Our top story, drop in the shares of Apple.  Another big tech fueling a big  selloff on Wall Street today.  The Dow Jones Industrial is down almost 400  points.  The S&amp;P 500 down 46, the NASDAQ lost more than 200 points.  And  amidst of the market turmoil, the White House continuing to demand fair  trade policies from China ahead of an upcoming meeting that will take place  between the President and Xi Jinping at the end of this month.</p><p> Edward Lawrence in Washington with the story.  Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Lou.  Trade fair is  part of that market drop.  The breaking news tonight, the state department  spokeswoman reacted to harsh language by the Chinese without mentioning  China following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  Now, the  statement tonight reads, the United States is proud to agree to promote  free and fair trade in the region and combat unfair trade practices.</p><p> It is unfortunate that not all economies despite their rhetoric could  support these positions.  And the cooperation summit fail to issue a joint  statement for the first time in 29 years.  The China blames the U.S. for  spoiling the summit.  A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying,  it seem like the U.S. attended this APEC meeting with great anger.   Speeches and remarks at the meeting openly cause controversy, created  discourse, spilling the atmosphere -- or spoiling the atmosphere of the  meeting and did not contribute to achieving consensus.</p><p> Well, the Vice President brief the President today.  This summit seem to  escalate the trade dispute towards a trade war as China continues with  their trading practices.  They are not changing.  The Chinese delegation  led Vice-Premier supposed to meet in Washington this week, they canceled  again.  These were prep talks related to the G27 Summit bilateral meeting  between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump.</p><p> The Chinese say the meeting will happen after the bilateral on December  1st, assuming it goes well.  Now, former FTC Chairman under President  Reagan says, China should not underestimate President Trump.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DANIEL OLIVER, FORMER FTC CHAIRMAN:  Trump is a very good negotiator.  He  negotiated with the Canadians and I think the Chinese should take a look at  how we negotiated with the Canadians and get ready for more.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now the Vice President told the Chinese the U.S. will not change  course unless China changes their trading practices.  The market reflected  that in part with this hardening to -- part of the hardening tone with the  selloff.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  Edward, thanks so much.  It's hard some days to tell whether it's  hardening or whether it's just an awakening on the part of the Chinese to  the fact that this president means business.  </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Yes.  And resetting those for fair trade deals.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.  And international economic order in need of  rebalancing across the entire breath of those relationships.  Edward, thank  you very much.  Edward Lawrence reporting from Washington.  On the U.S.  Southern border tonight, Homeland Security officials say the caravan of  Central American migrants consisting of nearly all single adult or teen  males and that at least 500 criminals have been identified among the ranks.</p><p> There are now about 6000 migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico.  That  is from the United States with thousands more expected to arrive behind  them over the coming days.  But as Correspondent William La Jeunesse now  reports.  They aren't receiving a warm welcome at all from the locals.  </p><p> WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou, as you  know, illegal immigration is not new to Mexico.  Generations of Central  Americans have used this country as a steppingstone to the United States.   But this caravan, how they cross the numbers seem to have awakened a silent  now vocal minority against them.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> JEUNESSE:  Tension in Tijuana.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here because our government has not taken  control of these what we call invasions.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  Shouting, Hondurans go home and viva Mexico.  Riot police Sunday  stopped hundreds of Mexicans trying to storm the migrant shelter.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see people within the migrant caravan smoking weed,  drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  These Mexicans oppose illegal immigration and blame officials  for allowing in thousands without papers.  They fear crime, a loss of jobs,  depressed wages in a country where 40 percent already live in poverty.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not in favor of them coming the way they did.  You  know, to me, if feels like they invaded.</p><p> JEUNESSE:  Nearby, a counter protest supporters say Mexico should welcome  and protect immigrants.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's important that we consider that our Mexican  brothers are also in the same situation.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  The shelter Sunday remained on lockdown until protesters went  home.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There here for work, to have a better life and no  troubles.  Not troublemakers.  </p><p> JEUNESSE:  More than 6000 caravan migrants arrived in Tijuana.  Their  shelter looking now like a refugee camp as many realize they cannot easily  cross the border and any asylum interviews is at least five weeks away.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I tell them it's better for you to get a job and it's  not working right.  And then (INAUDIBLE) trying to cross the border.</p><p> JEUNESSE:  This morning for the first time, the U.S. shut down the San  Ysidro Port of Entry.  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen saying in a tweet, CPB  believe a \"large number of caravan migrants plants to rush the border to  gain illegal access to the U.S\". </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> JEUNESSE:  So by shutting down lanes and slowing traffic and increasing  wait times, President Trump is sending a message to Mexico City that if you  fail to stop these on your southern border you face consequences on the  northern one.  And Lou, he's doing it in a language that everyone  understands, time is money.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  William, thank you very much.  William La Jeunesse reporting from  the San Ysidro Port of Entry.  Rain headed for Northern California this  week.  Welcome rain bringing conditions that could both help and hinder  efforts to put up the deadly campfire which has left at least 77 people  dead.  Correspondent Claudia Cowan has the latest tonight from Chico,  California.  </p><p> HAROLD SCHAPELHOUMAN, FIRE CHIEF, MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA:  It's a grim task  but it's necessary.  It really does, you know, help families out because it  allows them know what happened, as difficult as it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The flames may have slowed but the  recovery from the devastating California wildfires still in its early  stages with the death toll growing each day and the number of people  unaccounted for constantly fluctuating.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do this.</p><p> COWAN:  Now, search crews are in a race against mother nature with rain in  the forecast.  While it will help put out the fire and improve air quality,  rain could trigger mud slides and wash away the remains of those who died  in the fire.</p><p> MIKE MOHLER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION:  The  weather that's expected is definitely going to impact operations.  It's a - - especially during the recovery.  I'm working with the Sheriff's  Department and first responders.  Again, we have additional resources out  there really trying to work ahead of these storms.  </p><p> COWAN:  With more than 50000 left homeless by the campfire, thousands are  streaming through a disaster relief center trying to get their lives back  together.  </p><p> KEVIN HANNES, FEDERAL COOPERATING OFFICER, FEMA:  They can get initial  financial support from FEMA if they qualified for Federal assistance.  They  can get information, they can get their drivers license renewed, they can  update their mailing address with the postal service.  Social Security  cards can be issued here.  </p><p> COWAN:  An emotional vigil on Sunday night in Chico, California where the  community came together to heal and share stories of their escape.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were basically a moving bomb because we had a bunch  of propane tanks.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was leaves falling down on fire on top of us.   Propane tanks blowing it up.  It was -- it was like a war zone.  </p><p> COWAN:  Joe Florence (ph) and his family are thankful they made it out in  time.  And also for President Trump's visit here on Saturday.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm grateful for all the support that he's given us.   He didn't have to come here the way California (INAUDIBLE) and for that I'm  very grateful.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COWAN:  And the Federal aid that the President promised to help this  community promised to help this community recover is flowing.  More than  $3-1/2 million is already in the hands of 13,000 households that have  registered with FEMA here in Butte County.  Those numbers will certainly  grow.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  Claudia, thank you very much.  Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico,  California.  Still ahead here tonight, the White House has set new rules of  conduct for journalists as the national left-wing media continues to attack  President Trump rather than Jim Acosta's conduct.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jim Acosta's fight for press freedom resulted in a  resounding victory for the first amendment.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The system worked tax and balances worked.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Having the press in the White House is actually more of  it benefits the White House.  So maybe the Trump administration is a little  worried about cutting off that tool.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a about a slippery slope.  This is about what  other reporters can be talking about this White House.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't even think Donald Trump understands the  definition of decorum.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are watching the radioholic president at a point of  his greatest rage and who it's at and his greatest rage is at the press.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We'll take that up with attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett.  But up next, new science that tariffs on Chinese exports to the  United States are working and working very well.  Asia expert Gordon Chang  joins me to talk about the President's winning strategy and the threat of  communist China when we continue.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  A new report that demonstrates clearly President Trump is  succeeding in making China pay for most of the trade tariffs.  European  researchers now saying American consumers and companies are absorbing only  4-1/2 percent of those tariffs of the 25 percent imposed on $250 billion of  Chinese goods.  The remaining 80 percent of those tariffs are being paid by  China.  And joining me now to talk about the very tense U.S.-China  relationship and one that doesn't seem to be improving, Gordon Chang.</p><p> Author of the Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown.  Gordon,  good to have you here.  And welcome back from Tokyo.  Good to -- good to  see you.  But let's start with first these targeted tariffs that the  President has implemented and more to follow if the Chinese do not come to  their senses.  I mean, this has to shock places like Goldman Sachs and the  establishment forces that have been lobbying and against these tariffs.   Your thoughts?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST:  All the smart people who talks about how  the American consumer was going to be the one paying for all the tariffs.   Well, they are wrong and this is because the administration obviously  picked out those areas where there was a lot of elasticity and that's good.   You know, the important thing is that --</p><p> DOBBS:  There goes Gordon using economics where I was just saying today,  very few people talk about the elasticity that is the ability to substitute  goods or to delay purchasing based on price.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  The important thing here is that when you look at the broader  picture of the tariffs and the other things that the Trump administration  is doing he is actually encouraging supply chains to get out of China.  And  that's important for us because those supply chains are held hostage by  Beijing.  Whenever they get upset about something and it's often not about  trade, they go against our companies.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And sometimes we use the word -- the word supply chain are used too  liberally when the word really is production of products themselves in  China.  And a dependence upon China for that production.  That's got to  change obviously as you say.  Some other things have got to change.  One is  it's a communist government, they have expansionist and that's being kind.   They have -- they have colonial it seems at times but certainly imperial --  imperatives within their foreign policy that they seem to be shocked that  American president would resist as this one has. </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, Xi Jinping for more than a decade has been dropping  hints that China is the world's only sovereign state.  And this is just --  basically what he saying is that Americans, Japanese, whatever, you know,  are just mere subjects to the greater glory of the Chinese court.  You  know, the important thing for us is that those trade that we have, you  know, our factories in China are producing profits that China is then using  to put into its military which is configuring itself to fight Americans.</p><p> And so there is a long chain here and it's not just economics, it's also of  course security because China needs an enemy and they've identified us.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, they've identified us.  We should have been too hard to spot  because we are the only superpower in the world.  This is a -- this is a  country under this president that is not recognizable to the power  structure in Beijing, is it?  </p><p>CHANG:  No.  One thing that President Trump has done especially this year  is he's taken actions to defend the American economy.  Defend the American  society.  Chinese leaders don't how to deal with it.  So they try to talk  to Henry Kissinger, they go try to talk to the heads of financial  companies.  And --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  The establishment, Wall Street -- Wall Street has been carrying out  what the Vice President referred to as lobbying exercise, calling Wall  Street and American CEOs participating in the Chinese call for discussions  and talks unregistered foreign agents.  And my god, that's exactly what  they are and kudos to the Vice President for saying it exactly the way it  is.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And you know, we saw that September 16th meeting in Beijing  before the midterms.  Obviously the Chinese were trying to use the heads of  the big financial --</p><p> DOBBS:  They still are.</p><p>CHANG:  -- against the United States and it didn't work.  And right now,  the people in Beijing are scratching their head.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  It hasn't worked so far only because the CEOs didn't take them up  on the offer.  But they dispatch their minions from the -- in some cases  from the seed level offices of their banks and firms.  You know, this is an  ugly thing we're watching.  We're watching propaganda being organized  against this President's policies.  We're watching the establishment, try  to subvert the President's policies on China on international trade.</p><p> And the idea that this stuff that has been circulating from the  establishment whether it's at the Council of Foreign Relations or it's the  Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, you know, we need quick wins here after  this -- the midterms.  The president's got a quick win.  He won the Senate  for crying out loud.  He is accomplishing more and now they want to try to  talk their way, insinuate themselves into this President's administration  and to get him to -- in some cases dilute or even abandon policies that are  -- that are certain to be effective.  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, the most important thing here is that these tariffs that  people talked about, that are imposed under Section 301 of Trade Act of  1974 as a remedy for the theft of intellectual property.  The NSA last week  just came out with a report said China's theft of U.S. I.P. for commercial  purposes has actually increased over the last year.  We saw that report a  couple days -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  When is the last time you heard one of the front companies being  shut down by either the FBI or any intelligence operation of this agency of  this country?  You haven't.  You haven't heard -- we know that for years  they have been operating, literally thousands of front companies working  through our universities as well to what?  Gather intellectual property by  the hundreds of billions of dollars they steal a -- every year.  </p><p>CHANG:  We just got that report that Micron Technology, their most recent  chip has been completely stolen by the Chinese.  That was $8.95 billion  worth of I.P., just one theft and it's occurring across the board, Lou.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And these idiots -- and I will call them what they, they're  traitors to the United States.  Every one of these people trying to reverse  this President's policies, vis-a-vis, Beijing are betraying this country  and they're doing so for the -- the most sorted of reasons and that is  their own commercial interests.  Gordon, great to see.  Thanks for being  here.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  As always.  Gordon Chang.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.   The question is, do you believe communist China finally comprehends  President Trump's America First trade policies and demand for balance to  free trade -- fair trade?  And then into China's theft of U.S. technology  is now nonnegotiable.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs as always, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p> Up next, the White House unveiling a new code of conduct for the White  House press corps.  Oh, that's going to make a few of them very  uncomfortable.  Journalists with the national left-wing media must act like  adults.  You think they can do that?  Is this a fair set of guidelines?  We  take that and more right after the break.  Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett join me.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  The White House today outlining new rules for presidential news  conference.  The White House has dropped its effort to remove the hard pass  of CNN reporter, Jim Acosta.  The rules include limiting journalists to one  question each, follow-ups at the discretion of the President.  And the  letter warn, should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will  take action.</p><p> Well, joining me now to take up all of this, the fight over the acting  attorney general and more Harmeet Dhillon, attorney, RNC Committeewoman for  the great State of California.  Great to have you with us.  Gregg Jarrett,  Fox Legal Analyst, author of the New York Times best-selling, the Russia  Hoax.  And always good to have you with us.  Harmeet, let me begin with  you.  These rules tonight and if we could let's put those up full-screen  just for a second.</p><p> These look pretty simple, straightforward, does this meet the test of due  process that Judge Kelly asserted?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC CHAIRWOMAN:  Well, it's step one in the due process.   First, you have to have the rules announced in advance and then you have to  have a warning and notice an opportunity to be heard in response.  So, I do  think it satisfies the due process and now it remains to be seen whether  Acosta is going to carry out his part which is either behaving or being  able to justify his actions.</p><p> And if he chose the line as a result of this and everybody will be better  off and, you know, we won't have anything to worry about.  But if he  doesn't or somebody else doesn't, then yes, the White House has the right  to institute proceedings, give them an opportunity to respond and then take  a final action.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Your thoughts.</p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  There have always been rules of  decency and decorum that White House correspondents have always practiced  when I was there temporarily.  I knew the rules, I abided by the rules.   Then it comes along guys like Jim Acosta.  And they think they have the  right to be rude and abrasive and obnoxious and commandeer the news  conference and argue with the President and prevent his colleagues from  posing their questions.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You have to believe that they are a little upset, the White House  press corps that he has messed it up.  </p><p> JARRETT:  Yes.  And if I were press secretary, what I would do is the next  time Acosta pulls that I would say that's the end of the news conference,  not only today but for the rest of the week.  </p><p> DOBBS:  That's what the President said he will do.</p><p> JARRETT:  And the -- his colleagues, Acosta's colleagues would have  surrounded him and threatened to tar and feather and then kick him out.   And that is the most effective --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JARRETT:  -- get rid of that kind of conduct.  You know --</p><p> DOBBS:  I mean, let's be honest here, I want to ask you both.  Why -- Isn't  there a time where you have to just tell a district court judge to go to  hell?  Because I mean, the idea that you have to follow the dicta of a  district court judge and create rules and can't run the White House that  it's been run since time (INAUDIBLE) Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, Lou, to be -- to be fair to the judge, if you read his  ruling from the bench, it seems clear that he felt that he was constrained  by a prior decision.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS: Yes, but that's (INAUDIBLE) nonsense.  That was a 1977 -- excuse me  Harmeet that was an idiot in my opinion ruling.</p><p>DHILLON:  OK.</p><p> DOBBS:  This judge took a case in which you're dealing with a nation  reporter.  It wasn't about anything but his politics, it had nothing to do  with conduct, it had nothing to do with decorum.  And disrupting a  presidential press conference, it wasn't on point at all in my opinion.   You guys are the lawyer but I mean --</p><p>DHILLON:  Right.  Well, your question -- yes, your question was should we  tell the judge to go to hell and the answer is that's generally not a good  idea.  And I do think that norms announced in advance even though they're  obvious like, you know, you shouldn't have to tell people to behave like  adults but now that we have that, well, I think it's actually a good --</p><p> DOBBS:  You shouldn't have to tell a district court judge to get back on  your -- get back on your bailiwick either, what do you think?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, on the other -- </p><p> JARRETT:  Wait, you're absolutely right.  When you are of -- there's no  freedom to be obnoxious and rude, there's no freedom of the press to  question the president.  It's a privilege to be there at the White House  and there are rules and norms that have always been followed.  And now  you've got a judge who has decided to expand due process beyond any  resemblance --</p><p> DOBBS:  He's telling the president of the United States how to conduct the  --</p><p> JARRETT:  And I agree with you, I would tell the judge go to hell.  We're  going to practice the way we want.  Let the Supreme Court decide it if  necessary.</p><p> DOBBS:  Let me turn very quickly to the president prepared to give his  written answers to Robert Mueller.  Let's take his comments to Chris  Wallace yesterday, if we could please.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The questions were asked and  answered, wasn't a big deal.  You know, they make it like I had meetings  for many, many hours.  I got the questions, I responded, we wrote them out,  I read them once, I read them a second time we made some changes, that's  it.  I think that should solve the problem.  I hope itself is a problem, if  it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time  but probably this is the end.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  There's the president Harmeet, is this the end in your best  judgment?</p><p> DHILLON:  Well, I think it should be the end from the president's side.  I  think this is handled correctly and this is the extent of his involvement  in this now.  Who knows what Mueller is going to do with this and there may  be a second round.  This may attempt to go on forever but I hope for that  this puts an end.  Arrest and this is the appropriate way to handle it,  given how busy the president is.</p><p> DOBBS:  Gregg?</p><p> JARRETT:  With obstruction off the table, it should've taken five minutes  to answer the questions.  I don't know anything about collusion, I don't  know anybody else in my campaign who knew or colluded with Russia, end of  story.  And you can dismiss allegations of the Trump Tower meeting.  Did  Trump know in advance?  I did not he said that repeatedly.  Did you mislead  anyone in your dictated statement it was accurate to the best of my  knowledge.  So, I mean, those are the main questions they should be easy to  answer.</p><p> DOBBS:  And after over two years of investigating this president and his  administration, enough is enough, it's enough.  It's actually far more than  enough.</p><p> JARRETT:  Right.</p><p> DOBBS:  Harmeet Dhillon, Gregg Jarrett thank you both for being with us  tonight, thank you.</p><p> DHILLON:  Thanks Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  Up next, after nearly two weeks, the results are settled in  Florida.  It's up two victories -- two victories for the President and the  Republicans, the Senate majority for the Republicans is growing.  We take  that up and more with the dynamic duo, Diamond and Silk joining us tonight.   Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  On Wall Street today a big sell-off.  The Dow losing almost 400  points, the S&amp;P lost 46, the NASDAQ down 219.  Volume on the big board 3.7  billion shares.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet all dropping into bear  market territory closing out the day.  Facebook's stock plummeted heading  in -- heading into 2019.  The company's stock losing five percent hitting  its lowest level since February of 2017.  Facebook on track for its longest  quarterly loss to --losing streak since 2013.  </p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook weighing in on the possibility that Congress will  regulate big tech, here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market.  But we have to admit  when the free markets not working and it hasn't worked here and I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  The president has said as much.  The president making it very clear  that he is not thrilled with monopolistic powers or the oligopolies that  have formed in technology.</p><p> A reminder listened to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.</p><p> Embattled controversial election supervisor.  A Broward CountyFlorida has  produced a suitable ending, Brenda Snipes has resigned.  Snipes facing  criticism for her failure to comply with Florida law and the 2018 midterms  after years of incompetence and skulduggery, President Trump called for her  to be fired.  Just days ago, her resignation takes effect.  Are you ready?   She's a lame-duck.  Her resignation effective in January taking a page out  of -- well, someone we all knows book.</p><p> Joining me now, social media superstars, President Trump's most loyal  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you with us.  Let me start by  asking you, will there be now national left-wing media focus on the fact  this president has achieved a terrific victory for the U.S. Senate  enlarging the GOP majority?</p><p> LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  It should  be, they should focus on that, but you know they're not.  What they will  focus on the left-wing media is start throwing the racist word around or  this is racist or somebody as being racist towards me.  I absolutely love  and I'm so thrilled that Brenda Snipe's out.  Was that she's stepping down.</p><p> ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  Yes.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  She should have been fired a long time ago.  Because if you look  at what she did in this whole process is what they were trying to do.  They  were -- they were doing a rehearsal getting prepared for the 2020 run.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  It was going to be the art of the steal and I want everybody.  I  don't care what's on the aisle you're on to look at that.  When you break  our election laws and do what you want to and not answer questions that  should be answered.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  You're trying to take something you're trying to steal but she  should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p> DOBBS:  You know governor elect DeSantis saying that there was no way that  she was going to be the election supervisor through another election.  I'm  amazed that they put up with the shenanigans and being very kind.  The  cheating and the stealing in that elections office as long as they did.</p><p> The White House press corps let's turn their, new rules.  We can call them  the -- I don't know what the Acosta rules.  I don't know what you would  want to call them, in which the whole press corps gets to ask one question,  they've got to be civil and they've got to be kind of focused on their  manners.  What do you think?</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Well, listen, I absolutely love it.  I think Acosta if he wants  to be respected as a journalist, he have to respect the White House and  respect the president.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  He's going to have to do that.  No more acting like a baby, no  more wanting to suck on your pacifier.  We're not going to put you on  timeout.  If you do, if you defy the rules --</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  -- you're going to get thrown out, not a timeout but up at that  White House and your press conditions are going to be taken again.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  So, the bottom line is this Lou, if you act like a child you  would be treated like a child, bottom line.</p><p> DOBBS:  And certainly in the presence of the President of the United States  and in the White House itself, I would think that would come as second  nature to any American.</p><p> Let me -- let me turn first to in terms of foreign policy, a president who  has introduced the entire country and all of our trading partners to an  extraordinary concept.  We're going to have balanced trade, you're not  going to steal from us by the hundreds of billions of dollars a year  anymore.  Specifically that case obviously fits China.  They're behaving  like children, they want to be able to keep stealing and they think that we  should be subsidizing their economy and buying their products no matter  what the impact is on our workers and our corporations.  Your thoughts  about the Chinese having just a bit of a fit over this insistence by the  president.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Well, they're going to have to stop having this little hissy  fit.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Because you have a new sheriff in town, its President Donald  Trump and he's a businessman and it's going to be fair and equal trade  across the board.  You're not going to steal from us and they're going to  have to get that through their head.  And President Trump is not going to  waver nor is he going to back down.  I know that they're used to dealing  with weak presidents like President Obama and the rest of them.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  Yes.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  But you have a strong president that's not going to tolerate.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  And you have a strong president that's putting American first  baby.  It's about America because charity starts at home not abroad.</p><p> DOBBS:  Thank you so much for being with us.  It's always great to see you  my friends.  Thanks so much Diamond and Silk.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Thanks for having us.</p><p> DOBBS:  All the best.  Well, Pope Francis dining with 1,500 people, poor  people in the Vatican over the weekend.  And there, he decried the plight  of the indigent.  As he addressed the crowd of Francis lamented the poor  are weeping quote, while the wealthy few feast on what injustice belongs to  all.  Injustice is the perverse root of poverty.</p><p> Up next, there could be fewer U.S. troops along our southern border with  Mexico.  Are you ready for this already?  We're hearing from a general  about troop levels.  The caravan has arrived in Tijuana.  Thousands more  expected, what is going on?  We take up these latest developments with The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese when we return.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DOBBS:  The Pentagon may begin scaling back the troops posted along our  border with Mexico as early as this week.  The army commander overseeing  the mission Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan telling Politico the  missions end date remains December 15th that all of the active duty troops  who were sent to the border could be home by Christmas despite the expected  arrival of thousands more in caravans at the southern border in the days  and weeks ahead. </p><p> According to a new poll from Monmouth University, more than half of  Americans see the migrant caravans moving toward the country as a threat to  the United States.  In the poll released today nearly a third of them see  the caravans is a major threat.  And the same poll found seven and ten  Americans see illegal immigration as a serious issue.  Joining us tonight  to discuss the caravan, Jim Acosta's new rules, and the sore losers in the  Democratic Party, the Daily Callers Editorial Director Vince Coglianese.   It's good to have you with us, Vince. </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLERS:  Nice to be here, Lou.   Thank you. </p><p> DOBBS:  Let us start with this unexpected announcement that troops may  apparently be withdrawn very quickly from the border.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes, I think -- I thought an underlying principle of the Trump  administration is that we don't broadcast our intentions with our military  ahead of time.  We have to keep people guessing for national security  reasons and that's not what's happening here.  I think what you're pointing  out is that it's a bit of a bizarre messaging to say hey the troops are  going to be away from the border by Christmas.  And if you are the -- if  you're looking to illegally immigrate into the United States, you now have  a great time lined by which to do that.  So that's -- I think that's a bit  uninspired to be giving those sorts of answers whether or not you intend to  actually do it. </p><p> DOBBS:  This lieutenant general who I haven't heard of before but that  doesn't mean anything necessarily, had to surely understand this is a  political question of great sensitivity and that he would be very wise  indeed to not speak to it without White House approval, in fact insisting I  would think for his own career that it come from the White House. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  It was clearly an issue of sincere concern of the President of  the United States so that would be my first thought too, what does the  White House think of this, the statement I'm about to make.  And I think  what you're seeing if I'm just making a prediction here holding on my  finger at the wind, it looks like the military is succumbing a bit to the  liberal media pressure on this question.  This idea -- you saw the New York  Times run this big story.  The troops are out there.  They're going to miss  holidays.  They signed up to defend our country.  They signed up for our  national security.  And one of the paramount concerns is the integrity of  our borders. </p><p> These men and women on the border doing the job they were asked to do by  their Commander-in-Chief and yet the New York Times is coming at it from  the perspective of how dare they even be a part of this and I think the  military is coming to that a little bit by broadcasting this idea that oh  don't worry, everyone will be home by Christmas.  There won't be military  on the border to assist the border patrol.  Not a good message to send when  you have so many illegal immigrants knocking on the door. </p><p> DOBBS:  No matter what, there's a serious problem in the Pentagon because  once again Mattis, the Defense Secretary is putting himself in at this  point what appears to be opposition to the Commander in Chief.  Indeed a  stunning stuff to witness.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  And General Mattis went to the border this week with Kirstjen  Nielsen this past week to actually survey the activity of the troops.  It's  nice to see him out there.  I think that's a good thing encouraging the  troops, and that's -- and that's the key here.  And look, the reason those  troops are on the border is to assist the Border Patrol in its very tall  task.  I mean, you look at this migrant caravan that's standing in Tijuana  right now, that is not even the start of it.  Think back to October.  You  know this really well, Lou.  Nearly 60,000 people were arrested or turned  back at the border with the United States in Mexico.  That's a record.  And  that means that this migrant crisis is continuing every day.  Caravans,  forget caravans.  We have a caravan coming every day into the United States  of America. </p><p> DOBBS:  And let me turn to the White House since we're on that subject, and  that is the new rules announced by Sarah Sanders today, the new rules for  journalists in the White House press corps. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p> DOBBS:  One question, you know, behave yourself, we'll see how things go is  my summation.  Your reaction to these new Acosta rules. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Look, that's the key.  That's the key right there.  This is  Jim Acosta's fault.  The reality is, if you're a member of that press  corps, if you're in that White House press briefing room, yes, of course,  you're standing up alongside your fellow reporter arguing for the most  amount of times ask questions that you can possibly get.  But here's the  key.  Jim Acosta, by virtue of the debate he held with the President of the  United States, not questioning a debate.  He started to -- he started out  by saying he wanted to challenge the President on a talking point.  That's  not the role.  </p><p> The role is to get information out of the president for the American people  and he failed in that core test.  And in so doing, he made it worse for the  entire press corps because now they have restrictive rules on their ability  to ask follow-up questions, all courtesy of one man Jim Acosta. </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, one man and one organization.  Then you go to Jeff Zucker at  CNN, then you go to the parent Time-Warner, and then you go to the parent  of the parent which is AT&amp;T.  And the reality is we're watching corporate  behemoth direct the conduct that of a Jim Acosta.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p> DOBBS:  There's a purpose in it and no one should mistake that.  We're  watching Comcast when it comes to NBC.  I mean, it goes on and on.  These  are corporate, corporate journalists behaving that way.  Obviously at the  direction of their corporations. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, if you want you want to do something fun or if your  viewers ever want to basically take a look at like how that White House  press briefing room was actually composed and who gets paid by whom in that  room, look no further than the first couple rows.  Fox has a couple of  reporters by virtue of Fox News radio and Fox News and Fox Business, of  course.  But those are individual networks.  What you have in that room are  Washington Post reporters, New York Times reporters.  The first couple  rows, they're all paid by CNN and MSNBC.  They're paid contributors to  those networks.  In other words, those two lefty networks have control, are  paying a huge percentage of the major figures who were that press briefing.   That is a very real conflict of interest. </p><p> DOBBS:  Conflict of interest and one you would think that the White House  would want to examine very carefully.  You know, the issue of Acosta, the  CNN, you know, I just have to think that the White House press corps is  beside itself with these rules coming down all because of the way Acosta  behaved and you know, did so with you know, I mean it just doesn't make any  sense to me. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Unquestionably.  But one of the lessons I take from this is  like the seething hatred for the Trump White House must be so great in that  room that they're willing to tolerate the insanity of Jim Acosta which  strikes me as the most bizarre thing ever.  At some point, they have to tap  out in the go, you know what, Jim Acosta, you are poorly serving our  ability to actually ask questions of the White House. </p><p> DOBBS:  And I don't suppose that would be possibly a part of the White  House strategy to make certain that they become self-policing and self- aware.  Vince Coglianese, great to have you with us.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Thank you, Lou. </p><p> DOBBS:  Up next, more on the migrant Caravan as they find out what happens  in Tijuana, the Mexican people weren't too thrilled with them and they are  the ones protesting illegal immigrants not on this side of the border.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Last week we asked you if you believe President Trump's border wall  will ever be built?  67 percent of you said yes, and the rest, no.  Well,  here's where we are tonight, what we're looking at tomorrow.  The migrant  caravan in Tijuana now is facing such opposition from angry local residents  there reporting this fights in rocks hurl.  The Department of Homeland  Security also says at least 500 people, 500 of them criminals have been  identified within the caravan.  </p><p> Brenda Snipes, the Broward County Florida election supervisor is -- she's  submitted her resignation.  Over the last two weeks she's been responsible  for misplacing if you will, 2,000 ballots, counting those ballots, mixing  invalid ballots with good ones, failing to meet a deadline with machine  recount results altering the outcome of course of the recount, and in fact,  disqualifying it. </p><p> That's it for us tonight.  Tomorrow night, please be with us.  We'll see  you then.  Good night from New York. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Guys, I love this squad over there.  Thank you for watching.   Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network.  Have a good  night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good evening, everybody.  Our top  stories, tensions between the United States and China escalating as  President Trump and his administration insist on America First foreign  policy that includes fair trade, balance trade and respect for the U.S. and  U.S. property throughout the world.  China's president Xi Jinping and Vice  President Mike Pence delivered dueling speeches in Asia over the weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presenting two very different views of global trade and security.  We take  that up, we discuss the latest in the U.S.-China relationship.  China  expert Gordon Chang with us.  Also tonight, more in rest in Tijuana as  Central American migrants are clashing with hundreds of local Mexican  residents who don't want them in their city.  President Trump remaining  steadfast in his commitment to strong borders warning those in the caravan  not to try to enter, not to try to enter the United States illegally.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're not letting people in  to our country illegally.  And we're not doing a release.  We'll do a catch  but we're not doing releases.  So, if they think they're going to be  released into our country like in the old days, like for years and years  they catch and release, we're not releasing.  They don't get released.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We take up the latest in the situation south of our border.  Fox  Reporter William La Jeunesse, is reporting tonight from Tijuana and The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese join us.  In California, 80 are dead,  nearly 1000 people are still missing as the deadliest fire in the state's  history continue to burn ahead of an expected rainstorm.  We'll have the  latest from California, tonight.</p><p>Our top story, drop in the shares of Apple.  Another big tech fueling a big  selloff on Wall Street today.  The Dow Jones Industrial is down almost 400  points.  The S&amp;P 500 down 46, the NASDAQ lost more than 200 points.  And  amidst of the market turmoil, the White House continuing to demand fair  trade policies from China ahead of an upcoming meeting that will take place  between the President and Xi Jinping at the end of this month.</p><p>Edward Lawrence in Washington with the story.  Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Lou.  Trade fair is  part of that market drop.  The breaking news tonight, the state department  spokeswoman reacted to harsh language by the Chinese without mentioning  China following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  Now, the  statement tonight reads, the United States is proud to agree to promote  free and fair trade in the region and combat unfair trade practices.</p><p>It is unfortunate that not all economies despite their rhetoric could  support these positions.  And the cooperation summit fail to issue a joint  statement for the first time in 29 years.  The China blames the U.S. for  spoiling the summit.  A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying,  it seem like the U.S. attended this APEC meeting with great anger.   Speeches and remarks at the meeting openly cause controversy, created  discourse, spilling the atmosphere -- or spoiling the atmosphere of the  meeting and did not contribute to achieving consensus.</p><p>Well, the Vice President brief the President today.  This summit seem to  escalate the trade dispute towards a trade war as China continues with  their trading practices.  They are not changing.  The Chinese delegation  led Vice-Premier supposed to meet in Washington this week, they canceled  again.  These were prep talks related to the G27 Summit bilateral meeting  between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Chinese say the meeting will happen after the bilateral on December  1st, assuming it goes well.  Now, former FTC Chairman under President  Reagan says, China should not underestimate President Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DANIEL OLIVER, FORMER FTC CHAIRMAN:  Trump is a very good negotiator.  He  negotiated with the Canadians and I think the Chinese should take a look at  how we negotiated with the Canadians and get ready for more.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the Vice President told the Chinese the U.S. will not change  course unless China changes their trading practices.  The market reflected  that in part with this hardening to -- part of the hardening tone with the  selloff.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Edward, thanks so much.  It's hard some days to tell whether it's  hardening or whether it's just an awakening on the part of the Chinese to  the fact that this president means business.  </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Yes.  And resetting those for fair trade deals.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.  And international economic order in need of  rebalancing across the entire breath of those relationships.  Edward, thank  you very much.  Edward Lawrence reporting from Washington.  On the U.S.  Southern border tonight, Homeland Security officials say the caravan of  Central American migrants consisting of nearly all single adult or teen  males and that at least 500 criminals have been identified among the ranks.</p><p>There are now about 6000 migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico.  That  is from the United States with thousands more expected to arrive behind  them over the coming days.  But as Correspondent William La Jeunesse now  reports.  They aren't receiving a warm welcome at all from the locals.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou, as you  know, illegal immigration is not new to Mexico.  Generations of Central  Americans have used this country as a steppingstone to the United States.   But this caravan, how they cross the numbers seem to have awakened a silent  now vocal minority against them.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JEUNESSE:  Tension in Tijuana.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here because our government has not taken  control of these what we call invasions.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  Shouting, Hondurans go home and viva Mexico.  Riot police Sunday  stopped hundreds of Mexicans trying to storm the migrant shelter.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see people within the migrant caravan smoking weed,  drinking, throwing rocks at the cops, causing chaos.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  These Mexicans oppose illegal immigration and blame officials  for allowing in thousands without papers.  They fear crime, a loss of jobs,  depressed wages in a country where 40 percent already live in poverty.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not in favor of them coming the way they did.  You  know, to me, if feels like they invaded.</p><p>JEUNESSE:  Nearby, a counter protest supporters say Mexico should welcome  and protect immigrants.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's important that we consider that our Mexican  brothers are also in the same situation.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  The shelter Sunday remained on lockdown until protesters went  home.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There here for work, to have a better life and no  troubles.  Not troublemakers.  </p><p>JEUNESSE:  More than 6000 caravan migrants arrived in Tijuana.  Their  shelter looking now like a refugee camp as many realize they cannot easily  cross the border and any asylum interviews is at least five weeks away.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I tell them it's better for you to get a job and it's  not working right.  And then (INAUDIBLE) trying to cross the border.</p><p>JEUNESSE:  This morning for the first time, the U.S. shut down the San  Ysidro Port of Entry.  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen saying in a tweet, CPB  believe a \"large number of caravan migrants plants to rush the border to  gain illegal access to the U.S\". </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JEUNESSE:  So by shutting down lanes and slowing traffic and increasing  wait times, President Trump is sending a message to Mexico City that if you  fail to stop these on your southern border you face consequences on the  northern one.  And Lou, he's doing it in a language that everyone  understands, time is money.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  William, thank you very much.  William La Jeunesse reporting from  the San Ysidro Port of Entry.  Rain headed for Northern California this  week.  Welcome rain bringing conditions that could both help and hinder  efforts to put up the deadly campfire which has left at least 77 people  dead.  Correspondent Claudia Cowan has the latest tonight from Chico,  California.  </p><p>HAROLD SCHAPELHOUMAN, FIRE CHIEF, MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA:  It's a grim task  but it's necessary.  It really does, you know, help families out because it  allows them know what happened, as difficult as it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The flames may have slowed but the  recovery from the devastating California wildfires still in its early  stages with the death toll growing each day and the number of people  unaccounted for constantly fluctuating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do this.</p><p>COWAN:  Now, search crews are in a race against mother nature with rain in  the forecast.  While it will help put out the fire and improve air quality,  rain could trigger mud slides and wash away the remains of those who died  in the fire.</p><p>MIKE MOHLER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION:  The  weather that's expected is definitely going to impact operations.  It's a - - especially during the recovery.  I'm working with the Sheriff's  Department and first responders.  Again, we have additional resources out  there really trying to work ahead of these storms.  </p><p>COWAN:  With more than 50000 left homeless by the campfire, thousands are  streaming through a disaster relief center trying to get their lives back  together.  </p><p>KEVIN HANNES, FEDERAL COOPERATING OFFICER, FEMA:  They can get initial  financial support from FEMA if they qualified for Federal assistance.  They  can get information, they can get their drivers license renewed, they can  update their mailing address with the postal service.  Social Security  cards can be issued here.  </p><p>COWAN:  An emotional vigil on Sunday night in Chico, California where the  community came together to heal and share stories of their escape.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We were basically a moving bomb because we had a bunch  of propane tanks.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was leaves falling down on fire on top of us.   Propane tanks blowing it up.  It was -- it was like a war zone.  </p><p>COWAN:  Joe Florence (ph) and his family are thankful they made it out in  time.  And also for President Trump's visit here on Saturday.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm grateful for all the support that he's given us.   He didn't have to come here the way California (INAUDIBLE) and for that I'm  very grateful.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COWAN:  And the Federal aid that the President promised to help this  community promised to help this community recover is flowing.  More than  $3-1/2 million is already in the hands of 13,000 households that have  registered with FEMA here in Butte County.  Those numbers will certainly  grow.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Claudia, thank you very much.  Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico,  California.  Still ahead here tonight, the White House has set new rules of  conduct for journalists as the national left-wing media continues to attack  President Trump rather than Jim Acosta's conduct.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jim Acosta's fight for press freedom resulted in a  resounding victory for the first amendment.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The system worked tax and balances worked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Having the press in the White House is actually more of  it benefits the White House.  So maybe the Trump administration is a little  worried about cutting off that tool.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a about a slippery slope.  This is about what  other reporters can be talking about this White House.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't even think Donald Trump understands the  definition of decorum.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are watching the radioholic president at a point of  his greatest rage and who it's at and his greatest rage is at the press.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll take that up with attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett.  But up next, new science that tariffs on Chinese exports to the  United States are working and working very well.  Asia expert Gordon Chang  joins me to talk about the President's winning strategy and the threat of  communist China when we continue.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A new report that demonstrates clearly President Trump is  succeeding in making China pay for most of the trade tariffs.  European  researchers now saying American consumers and companies are absorbing only  4-1/2 percent of those tariffs of the 25 percent imposed on $250 billion of  Chinese goods.  The remaining 80 percent of those tariffs are being paid by  China.  And joining me now to talk about the very tense U.S.-China  relationship and one that doesn't seem to be improving, Gordon Chang.</p><p>Author of the Coming Collapse of China and the Nuclear Showdown.  Gordon,  good to have you here.  And welcome back from Tokyo.  Good to -- good to  see you.  But let's start with first these targeted tariffs that the  President has implemented and more to follow if the Chinese do not come to  their senses.  I mean, this has to shock places like Goldman Sachs and the  establishment forces that have been lobbying and against these tariffs.   Your thoughts?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST:  All the smart people who talks about how  the American consumer was going to be the one paying for all the tariffs.   Well, they are wrong and this is because the administration obviously  picked out those areas where there was a lot of elasticity and that's good.   You know, the important thing is that --</p><p>DOBBS:  There goes Gordon using economics where I was just saying today,  very few people talk about the elasticity that is the ability to substitute  goods or to delay purchasing based on price.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  The important thing here is that when you look at the broader  picture of the tariffs and the other things that the Trump administration  is doing he is actually encouraging supply chains to get out of China.  And  that's important for us because those supply chains are held hostage by  Beijing.  Whenever they get upset about something and it's often not about  trade, they go against our companies.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And sometimes we use the word -- the word supply chain are used too  liberally when the word really is production of products themselves in  China.  And a dependence upon China for that production.  That's got to  change obviously as you say.  Some other things have got to change.  One is  it's a communist government, they have expansionist and that's being kind.   They have -- they have colonial it seems at times but certainly imperial --  imperatives within their foreign policy that they seem to be shocked that  American president would resist as this one has. </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, Xi Jinping for more than a decade has been dropping  hints that China is the world's only sovereign state.  And this is just --  basically what he saying is that Americans, Japanese, whatever, you know,  are just mere subjects to the greater glory of the Chinese court.  You  know, the important thing for us is that those trade that we have, you  know, our factories in China are producing profits that China is then using  to put into its military which is configuring itself to fight Americans.</p><p>And so there is a long chain here and it's not just economics, it's also of  course security because China needs an enemy and they've identified us.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, they've identified us.  We should have been too hard to spot  because we are the only superpower in the world.  This is a -- this is a  country under this president that is not recognizable to the power  structure in Beijing, is it?  </p><p>CHANG:  No.  One thing that President Trump has done especially this year  is he's taken actions to defend the American economy.  Defend the American  society.  Chinese leaders don't how to deal with it.  So they try to talk  to Henry Kissinger, they go try to talk to the heads of financial  companies.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The establishment, Wall Street -- Wall Street has been carrying out  what the Vice President referred to as lobbying exercise, calling Wall  Street and American CEOs participating in the Chinese call for discussions  and talks unregistered foreign agents.  And my god, that's exactly what  they are and kudos to the Vice President for saying it exactly the way it  is.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And you know, we saw that September 16th meeting in Beijing  before the midterms.  Obviously the Chinese were trying to use the heads of  the big financial --</p><p>DOBBS:  They still are.</p><p>CHANG:  -- against the United States and it didn't work.  And right now,  the people in Beijing are scratching their head.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  It hasn't worked so far only because the CEOs didn't take them up  on the offer.  But they dispatch their minions from the -- in some cases  from the seed level offices of their banks and firms.  You know, this is an  ugly thing we're watching.  We're watching propaganda being organized  against this President's policies.  We're watching the establishment, try  to subvert the President's policies on China on international trade.</p><p>And the idea that this stuff that has been circulating from the  establishment whether it's at the Council of Foreign Relations or it's the  Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, you know, we need quick wins here after  this -- the midterms.  The president's got a quick win.  He won the Senate  for crying out loud.  He is accomplishing more and now they want to try to  talk their way, insinuate themselves into this President's administration  and to get him to -- in some cases dilute or even abandon policies that are  -- that are certain to be effective.  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, the most important thing here is that these tariffs that  people talked about, that are imposed under Section 301 of Trade Act of  1974 as a remedy for the theft of intellectual property.  The NSA last week  just came out with a report said China's theft of U.S. I.P. for commercial  purposes has actually increased over the last year.  We saw that report a  couple days -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  When is the last time you heard one of the front companies being  shut down by either the FBI or any intelligence operation of this agency of  this country?  You haven't.  You haven't heard -- we know that for years  they have been operating, literally thousands of front companies working  through our universities as well to what?  Gather intellectual property by  the hundreds of billions of dollars they steal a -- every year.  </p><p>CHANG:  We just got that report that Micron Technology, their most recent  chip has been completely stolen by the Chinese.  That was $8.95 billion  worth of I.P., just one theft and it's occurring across the board, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And these idiots -- and I will call them what they, they're  traitors to the United States.  Every one of these people trying to reverse  this President's policies, vis-a-vis, Beijing are betraying this country  and they're doing so for the -- the most sorted of reasons and that is  their own commercial interests.  Gordon, great to see.  Thanks for being  here.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  As always.  Gordon Chang.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.   The question is, do you believe communist China finally comprehends  President Trump's America First trade policies and demand for balance to  free trade -- fair trade?  And then into China's theft of U.S. technology  is now nonnegotiable.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs as always, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, the White House unveiling a new code of conduct for the White  House press corps.  Oh, that's going to make a few of them very  uncomfortable.  Journalists with the national left-wing media must act like  adults.  You think they can do that?  Is this a fair set of guidelines?  We  take that and more right after the break.  Harmeet Dhillon and Gregg  Jarrett join me.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The White House today outlining new rules for presidential news  conference.  The White House has dropped its effort to remove the hard pass  of CNN reporter, Jim Acosta.  The rules include limiting journalists to one  question each, follow-ups at the discretion of the President.  And the  letter warn, should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will  take action.</p><p>Well, joining me now to take up all of this, the fight over the acting  attorney general and more Harmeet Dhillon, attorney, RNC Committeewoman for  the great State of California.  Great to have you with us.  Gregg Jarrett,  Fox Legal Analyst, author of the New York Times best-selling, the Russia  Hoax.  And always good to have you with us.  Harmeet, let me begin with  you.  These rules tonight and if we could let's put those up full-screen  just for a second.</p><p>These look pretty simple, straightforward, does this meet the test of due  process that Judge Kelly asserted?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC CHAIRWOMAN:  Well, it's step one in the due process.   First, you have to have the rules announced in advance and then you have to  have a warning and notice an opportunity to be heard in response.  So, I do  think it satisfies the due process and now it remains to be seen whether  Acosta is going to carry out his part which is either behaving or being  able to justify his actions.</p><p>And if he chose the line as a result of this and everybody will be better  off and, you know, we won't have anything to worry about.  But if he  doesn't or somebody else doesn't, then yes, the White House has the right  to institute proceedings, give them an opportunity to respond and then take  a final action.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Your thoughts.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  There have always been rules of  decency and decorum that White House correspondents have always practiced  when I was there temporarily.  I knew the rules, I abided by the rules.   Then it comes along guys like Jim Acosta.  And they think they have the  right to be rude and abrasive and obnoxious and commandeer the news  conference and argue with the President and prevent his colleagues from  posing their questions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You have to believe that they are a little upset, the White House  press corps that he has messed it up.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Yes.  And if I were press secretary, what I would do is the next  time Acosta pulls that I would say that's the end of the news conference,  not only today but for the rest of the week.  </p><p>DOBBS:  That's what the President said he will do.</p><p>JARRETT:  And the -- his colleagues, Acosta's colleagues would have  surrounded him and threatened to tar and feather and then kick him out.   And that is the most effective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  -- get rid of that kind of conduct.  You know --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, let's be honest here, I want to ask you both.  Why -- Isn't  there a time where you have to just tell a district court judge to go to  hell?  Because I mean, the idea that you have to follow the dicta of a  district court judge and create rules and can't run the White House that  it's been run since time (INAUDIBLE) Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, Lou, to be -- to be fair to the judge, if you read his  ruling from the bench, it seems clear that he felt that he was constrained  by a prior decision.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, but that's (INAUDIBLE) nonsense.  That was a 1977 -- excuse me  Harmeet that was an idiot in my opinion ruling.</p><p>DHILLON:  OK.</p><p>DOBBS:  This judge took a case in which you're dealing with a nation  reporter.  It wasn't about anything but his politics, it had nothing to do  with conduct, it had nothing to do with decorum.  And disrupting a  presidential press conference, it wasn't on point at all in my opinion.   You guys are the lawyer but I mean --</p><p>DHILLON:  Right.  Well, your question -- yes, your question was should we  tell the judge to go to hell and the answer is that's generally not a good  idea.  And I do think that norms announced in advance even though they're  obvious like, you know, you shouldn't have to tell people to behave like  adults but now that we have that, well, I think it's actually a good --</p><p>DOBBS:  You shouldn't have to tell a district court judge to get back on  your -- get back on your bailiwick either, what do you think?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, on the other -- </p><p>JARRETT:  Wait, you're absolutely right.  When you are of -- there's no  freedom to be obnoxious and rude, there's no freedom of the press to  question the president.  It's a privilege to be there at the White House  and there are rules and norms that have always been followed.  And now  you've got a judge who has decided to expand due process beyond any  resemblance --</p><p>DOBBS:  He's telling the president of the United States how to conduct the  --</p><p>JARRETT:  And I agree with you, I would tell the judge go to hell.  We're  going to practice the way we want.  Let the Supreme Court decide it if  necessary.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me turn very quickly to the president prepared to give his  written answers to Robert Mueller.  Let's take his comments to Chris  Wallace yesterday, if we could please.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The questions were asked and  answered, wasn't a big deal.  You know, they make it like I had meetings  for many, many hours.  I got the questions, I responded, we wrote them out,  I read them once, I read them a second time we made some changes, that's  it.  I think that should solve the problem.  I hope itself is a problem, if  it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time  but probably this is the end.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  There's the president Harmeet, is this the end in your best  judgment?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I think it should be the end from the president's side.  I  think this is handled correctly and this is the extent of his involvement  in this now.  Who knows what Mueller is going to do with this and there may  be a second round.  This may attempt to go on forever but I hope for that  this puts an end.  Arrest and this is the appropriate way to handle it,  given how busy the president is.</p><p>DOBBS:  Gregg?</p><p>JARRETT:  With obstruction off the table, it should've taken five minutes  to answer the questions.  I don't know anything about collusion, I don't  know anybody else in my campaign who knew or colluded with Russia, end of  story.  And you can dismiss allegations of the Trump Tower meeting.  Did  Trump know in advance?  I did not he said that repeatedly.  Did you mislead  anyone in your dictated statement it was accurate to the best of my  knowledge.  So, I mean, those are the main questions they should be easy to  answer.</p><p>DOBBS:  And after over two years of investigating this president and his  administration, enough is enough, it's enough.  It's actually far more than  enough.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Harmeet Dhillon, Gregg Jarrett thank you both for being with us  tonight, thank you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, after nearly two weeks, the results are settled in  Florida.  It's up two victories -- two victories for the President and the  Republicans, the Senate majority for the Republicans is growing.  We take  that up and more with the dynamic duo, Diamond and Silk joining us tonight.   Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  On Wall Street today a big sell-off.  The Dow losing almost 400  points, the S&amp;P lost 46, the NASDAQ down 219.  Volume on the big board 3.7  billion shares.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet all dropping into bear  market territory closing out the day.  Facebook's stock plummeted heading  in -- heading into 2019.  The company's stock losing five percent hitting  its lowest level since February of 2017.  Facebook on track for its longest  quarterly loss to --losing streak since 2013.  </p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook weighing in on the possibility that Congress will  regulate big tech, here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market.  But we have to admit  when the free markets not working and it hasn't worked here and I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  The president has said as much.  The president making it very clear  that he is not thrilled with monopolistic powers or the oligopolies that  have formed in technology.</p><p>A reminder listened to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Embattled controversial election supervisor.  A Broward CountyFlorida has  produced a suitable ending, Brenda Snipes has resigned.  Snipes facing  criticism for her failure to comply with Florida law and the 2018 midterms  after years of incompetence and skulduggery, President Trump called for her  to be fired.  Just days ago, her resignation takes effect.  Are you ready?   She's a lame-duck.  Her resignation effective in January taking a page out  of -- well, someone we all knows book.</p><p>Joining me now, social media superstars, President Trump's most loyal  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you with us.  Let me start by  asking you, will there be now national left-wing media focus on the fact  this president has achieved a terrific victory for the U.S. Senate  enlarging the GOP majority?</p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  It should  be, they should focus on that, but you know they're not.  What they will  focus on the left-wing media is start throwing the racist word around or  this is racist or somebody as being racist towards me.  I absolutely love  and I'm so thrilled that Brenda Snipe's out.  Was that she's stepping down.</p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITIES, DIAMOND AND SILK:  Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  She should have been fired a long time ago.  Because if you look  at what she did in this whole process is what they were trying to do.  They  were -- they were doing a rehearsal getting prepared for the 2020 run.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  It was going to be the art of the steal and I want everybody.  I  don't care what's on the aisle you're on to look at that.  When you break  our election laws and do what you want to and not answer questions that  should be answered.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  You're trying to take something you're trying to steal but she  should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know governor elect DeSantis saying that there was no way that  she was going to be the election supervisor through another election.  I'm  amazed that they put up with the shenanigans and being very kind.  The  cheating and the stealing in that elections office as long as they did.</p><p>The White House press corps let's turn their, new rules.  We can call them  the -- I don't know what the Acosta rules.  I don't know what you would  want to call them, in which the whole press corps gets to ask one question,  they've got to be civil and they've got to be kind of focused on their  manners.  What do you think?</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, listen, I absolutely love it.  I think Acosta if he wants  to be respected as a journalist, he have to respect the White House and  respect the president.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  He's going to have to do that.  No more acting like a baby, no  more wanting to suck on your pacifier.  We're not going to put you on  timeout.  If you do, if you defy the rules --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  -- you're going to get thrown out, not a timeout but up at that  White House and your press conditions are going to be taken again.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  So, the bottom line is this Lou, if you act like a child you  would be treated like a child, bottom line.</p><p>DOBBS:  And certainly in the presence of the President of the United States  and in the White House itself, I would think that would come as second  nature to any American.</p><p>Let me -- let me turn first to in terms of foreign policy, a president who  has introduced the entire country and all of our trading partners to an  extraordinary concept.  We're going to have balanced trade, you're not  going to steal from us by the hundreds of billions of dollars a year  anymore.  Specifically that case obviously fits China.  They're behaving  like children, they want to be able to keep stealing and they think that we  should be subsidizing their economy and buying their products no matter  what the impact is on our workers and our corporations.  Your thoughts  about the Chinese having just a bit of a fit over this insistence by the  president.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, they're going to have to stop having this little hissy  fit.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Because you have a new sheriff in town, its President Donald  Trump and he's a businessman and it's going to be fair and equal trade  across the board.  You're not going to steal from us and they're going to  have to get that through their head.  And President Trump is not going to  waver nor is he going to back down.  I know that they're used to dealing  with weak presidents like President Obama and the rest of them.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  Yes.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  But you have a strong president that's not going to tolerate.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  And you have a strong president that's putting American first  baby.  It's about America because charity starts at home not abroad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you so much for being with us.  It's always great to see you  my friends.  Thanks so much Diamond and Silk.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>DOBBS:  All the best.  Well, Pope Francis dining with 1,500 people, poor  people in the Vatican over the weekend.  And there, he decried the plight  of the indigent.  As he addressed the crowd of Francis lamented the poor  are weeping quote, while the wealthy few feast on what injustice belongs to  all.  Injustice is the perverse root of poverty.</p><p>Up next, there could be fewer U.S. troops along our southern border with  Mexico.  Are you ready for this already?  We're hearing from a general  about troop levels.  The caravan has arrived in Tijuana.  Thousands more  expected, what is going on?  We take up these latest developments with The  Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese when we return.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  The Pentagon may begin scaling back the troops posted along our  border with Mexico as early as this week.  The army commander overseeing  the mission Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan telling Politico the  missions end date remains December 15th that all of the active duty troops  who were sent to the border could be home by Christmas despite the expected  arrival of thousands more in caravans at the southern border in the days  and weeks ahead. </p><p>According to a new poll from Monmouth University, more than half of  Americans see the migrant caravans moving toward the country as a threat to  the United States.  In the poll released today nearly a third of them see  the caravans is a major threat.  And the same poll found seven and ten  Americans see illegal immigration as a serious issue.  Joining us tonight  to discuss the caravan, Jim Acosta's new rules, and the sore losers in the  Democratic Party, the Daily Callers Editorial Director Vince Coglianese.   It's good to have you with us, Vince. </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLERS:  Nice to be here, Lou.   Thank you. </p><p>DOBBS:  Let us start with this unexpected announcement that troops may  apparently be withdrawn very quickly from the border.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes, I think -- I thought an underlying principle of the Trump  administration is that we don't broadcast our intentions with our military  ahead of time.  We have to keep people guessing for national security  reasons and that's not what's happening here.  I think what you're pointing  out is that it's a bit of a bizarre messaging to say hey the troops are  going to be away from the border by Christmas.  And if you are the -- if  you're looking to illegally immigrate into the United States, you now have  a great time lined by which to do that.  So that's -- I think that's a bit  uninspired to be giving those sorts of answers whether or not you intend to  actually do it. </p><p>DOBBS:  This lieutenant general who I haven't heard of before but that  doesn't mean anything necessarily, had to surely understand this is a  political question of great sensitivity and that he would be very wise  indeed to not speak to it without White House approval, in fact insisting I  would think for his own career that it come from the White House. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  It was clearly an issue of sincere concern of the President of  the United States so that would be my first thought too, what does the  White House think of this, the statement I'm about to make.  And I think  what you're seeing if I'm just making a prediction here holding on my  finger at the wind, it looks like the military is succumbing a bit to the  liberal media pressure on this question.  This idea -- you saw the New York  Times run this big story.  The troops are out there.  They're going to miss  holidays.  They signed up to defend our country.  They signed up for our  national security.  And one of the paramount concerns is the integrity of  our borders. </p><p>These men and women on the border doing the job they were asked to do by  their Commander-in-Chief and yet the New York Times is coming at it from  the perspective of how dare they even be a part of this and I think the  military is coming to that a little bit by broadcasting this idea that oh  don't worry, everyone will be home by Christmas.  There won't be military  on the border to assist the border patrol.  Not a good message to send when  you have so many illegal immigrants knocking on the door. </p><p>DOBBS:  No matter what, there's a serious problem in the Pentagon because  once again Mattis, the Defense Secretary is putting himself in at this  point what appears to be opposition to the Commander in Chief.  Indeed a  stunning stuff to witness.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  And General Mattis went to the border this week with Kirstjen  Nielsen this past week to actually survey the activity of the troops.  It's  nice to see him out there.  I think that's a good thing encouraging the  troops, and that's -- and that's the key here.  And look, the reason those  troops are on the border is to assist the Border Patrol in its very tall  task.  I mean, you look at this migrant caravan that's standing in Tijuana  right now, that is not even the start of it.  Think back to October.  You  know this really well, Lou.  Nearly 60,000 people were arrested or turned  back at the border with the United States in Mexico.  That's a record.  And  that means that this migrant crisis is continuing every day.  Caravans,  forget caravans.  We have a caravan coming every day into the United States  of America. </p><p>DOBBS:  And let me turn to the White House since we're on that subject, and  that is the new rules announced by Sarah Sanders today, the new rules for  journalists in the White House press corps. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  One question, you know, behave yourself, we'll see how things go is  my summation.  Your reaction to these new Acosta rules. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Look, that's the key.  That's the key right there.  This is  Jim Acosta's fault.  The reality is, if you're a member of that press  corps, if you're in that White House press briefing room, yes, of course,  you're standing up alongside your fellow reporter arguing for the most  amount of times ask questions that you can possibly get.  But here's the  key.  Jim Acosta, by virtue of the debate he held with the President of the  United States, not questioning a debate.  He started to -- he started out  by saying he wanted to challenge the President on a talking point.  That's  not the role.  </p><p>The role is to get information out of the president for the American people  and he failed in that core test.  And in so doing, he made it worse for the  entire press corps because now they have restrictive rules on their ability  to ask follow-up questions, all courtesy of one man Jim Acosta. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, one man and one organization.  Then you go to Jeff Zucker at  CNN, then you go to the parent Time-Warner, and then you go to the parent  of the parent which is AT&amp;T.  And the reality is we're watching corporate  behemoth direct the conduct that of a Jim Acosta.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  There's a purpose in it and no one should mistake that.  We're  watching Comcast when it comes to NBC.  I mean, it goes on and on.  These  are corporate, corporate journalists behaving that way.  Obviously at the  direction of their corporations. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, if you want you want to do something fun or if your  viewers ever want to basically take a look at like how that White House  press briefing room was actually composed and who gets paid by whom in that  room, look no further than the first couple rows.  Fox has a couple of  reporters by virtue of Fox News radio and Fox News and Fox Business, of  course.  But those are individual networks.  What you have in that room are  Washington Post reporters, New York Times reporters.  The first couple  rows, they're all paid by CNN and MSNBC.  They're paid contributors to  those networks.  In other words, those two lefty networks have control, are  paying a huge percentage of the major figures who were that press briefing.   That is a very real conflict of interest. </p><p>DOBBS:  Conflict of interest and one you would think that the White House  would want to examine very carefully.  You know, the issue of Acosta, the  CNN, you know, I just have to think that the White House press corps is  beside itself with these rules coming down all because of the way Acosta  behaved and you know, did so with you know, I mean it just doesn't make any  sense to me. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Unquestionably.  But one of the lessons I take from this is  like the seething hatred for the Trump White House must be so great in that  room that they're willing to tolerate the insanity of Jim Acosta which  strikes me as the most bizarre thing ever.  At some point, they have to tap  out in the go, you know what, Jim Acosta, you are poorly serving our  ability to actually ask questions of the White House. </p><p>DOBBS:  And I don't suppose that would be possibly a part of the White  House strategy to make certain that they become self-policing and self- aware.  Vince Coglianese, great to have you with us.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Thank you, Lou. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the migrant Caravan as they find out what happens  in Tijuana, the Mexican people weren't too thrilled with them and they are  the ones protesting illegal immigrants not on this side of the border.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Last week we asked you if you believe President Trump's border wall  will ever be built?  67 percent of you said yes, and the rest, no.  Well,  here's where we are tonight, what we're looking at tomorrow.  The migrant  caravan in Tijuana now is facing such opposition from angry local residents  there reporting this fights in rocks hurl.  The Department of Homeland  Security also says at least 500 people, 500 of them criminals have been  identified within the caravan.  </p><p>Brenda Snipes, the Broward County Florida election supervisor is -- she's  submitted her resignation.  Over the last two weeks she's been responsible  for misplacing if you will, 2,000 ballots, counting those ballots, mixing  invalid ballots with good ones, failing to meet a deadline with machine  recount results altering the outcome of course of the recount, and in fact,  disqualifying it. </p><p>That's it for us tonight.  Tomorrow night, please be with us.  We'll see  you then.  Good night from New York. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It would allow easy transfer of photos, chat histories, posts, friend lists, profile information and other content between different platforms. Basically, it's the data portability law.</p><p><br/>Today, numerical portability allows mobile phone users to switch service providers easily. It's a process you can't demand more than one business day. Just as this right exists (which only involves the number and not the transfer of user data), in the near future platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, among others, would have 120 days for the transfer of information from one company to another.<br/>The project is called access act (Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching, i.e. Increasing Compatibility and Competition through Service Switching). He is led by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal, and Republican Josh Hawley.<br/>\"By making it easier for social media users to move their data or continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, new companies will be able to compete on an equal footing with the largest social media companies,\" he said Warner in a statement uploaded to the U.S. Senate platform.<br/>The senator argues that users will be able to better manage their accounts on different platforms.\" By enabling portability, interoperability and delegability, this bill will put consumers in the driver's seat about how and where they use social media,\" he said.<br/>The key: interoperability<br/>(Shutterstock)<br/>\"The main objective of the right to portability is to empower citizens with greater control over their own data,\" says Infobae Miguel Sumer El\u00edas, a lawyer specializing in computer law, director of Legal Informatics.<br/>It would facilitate the right to move, copy, or transmit the data themselves from one IT environment to another. The project proposes that social networks may be required to have systems interoperable with others. These are interfaces that must be created so that different platforms can be compatible for the transfer of information.<br/>\"One of the main problems that portability has is, although it is a right with very good intentions, the format. There is no standardized format for portability, nor is it specified in Article 20 of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),\" says Sumer Elias.<br/>The GDPR enshrines the right to data portability: \"The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data that concerns him, that he has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and mechanically readable format, and to transmit them to other controller without being prevented by the controller to those who have provided them.\" However, there is no interoperability yet.<br/>However, starting with GDPR and its data portability section, several services began to add functions so that a user can obtain their information. Google, for example, offers the Takeout tool, a data export system for all the tech giant's services.<br/>alt-\"\" height-\"4023\" src\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/tFSNmIR2o-cmVnKN3yjvv41MT7o/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJIAVFYTMFDFPNJOYEOBQPNGQY.jpg\">https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/tFSNmIR2o-cmVnKN3yjvv41MT7o/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJIAVFYTMFDFPNJOYEOBQPNGQY.jpg</url>\"<br/>It is possible to have all the information that a person has uploaded to the different platforms, but it does not allow data portability. Other companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter also offer to deliver folders with posts, photos and other user content (and increasingly, they are improving these services).<br/>They would also be working on developing projects linked to what data transfer might look like in the future. It will be key for large companies to work in cooperation. Therefore, application programming interfaces (APIs) will be the key to making information accessible when transferring data.<br/>For portability to be carried out, there must be a homogenization of the standards used by different organizations with their own data. \"It's not a matter of everyone implementing their own technology. There are technological and legal standards,\" adds the lawyer.<br/>What happens in Argentina<br/>In Law 25.326 on the Protection of Personal Data, sanctioned in 2000, there is still no right of data portability. \"This law is almost an exact copy of the Spanish data protection law of 1992, believe it or not. There is a rather consensed project between the various political parties for law reform,\" says Sumer Elias.<br/>By the political juncture, he did not see the light yet. \"It copies the spirit of the GDPR and, apparently, if all goes well, next year we would be having a new personal data protection law, similar to the European one, which also induces the right to portability,\" he says.<br/>Could data portability then be possible?<br/>\"On the feasibility of the project being realized, it is difficult to say. The lobby of big tech companies is high. Implementation is probably the most complex, as all the companies to which the law would apply must in turn set some kind of standard for users to upload that data or \"import it\", and take advantage of it in another service,\" he tells Infobae Leandro Ucciferri, public policy analyst at ADC (Association for Civil Rights).<br/>Ucciferri refers to an article in The Verge that clarifies that the bill also gives nist (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) 180 days to publish technical interoperability standards on different types of platforms. \"In that NIST work there will be a little success of how it is implemented in the long term,\" he says.<br/>Regarding negative readings of the project, Ucciferri argues that some companies argue that it is dangerous to introduce the right of portability by jeopardising privacy protection. \"This argument seems to me to be a simple excuse to avoid giving a much more complex conversation that involves giving users the power to define how they want to use their personal data.\"<br/>KEEP READING:<br/>In the age of big data, what are the 5 changes that seek to modernize the Personal Data Protection Act<br/>Non-consensual portability: how to avoid being a victim of changing the phone company without permission<br/>What happens in your brain when the first thing you do when you wake up is check your cell phone<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9184011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC7-0411-JBJN-M2FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 26, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mr. Manjoo is off this week, so Mr. Isaac is conversing with Jim Kerstetter, deputy tech editor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike: Another week, another newsletter without Farhad Manjoo. Also known as ''vacation Manjoo.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But look! It's trusty deputy tech editor and guy-who-could-probably-fire-me Jim Kerstetter! Did I mention you're looking particularly svelte today, Jim?</p><p>  Jim: Why thank you, Mike. Might I say your beard looks particularly lush? Are you using conditioner?</p><p>  Mike: You noticed! Beard oil, actually. I'm not kidding.</p><p>  So it has been quite a week in our industry. Apple released another record quarter of sales, and analysts all shrugged and predicted the eventual end of the iPhone boom, as they tend to do. Nintendo released its first smartphone game, which for some reason did not involve Mario or anyone wearing overalls and a mustache. I predict catastrophe.</p><p>  Jim: First of all, it's pretty astonishing that Nintendo just released its first smartphone game. Did they think these smartphone things were a fad? My daughter's little Nintendo DS is sitting on a bookshelf in our living room. It has been sitting on that shelf for two years. As for Apple, what can you say? At some point when you've saturated the United States, Europe and China, sales are going to slow down. I'm not saying they're at that point. But what goes up...</p><p>  I'd like to talk a little about Twitter. Mike, you've covered them since the early days. Is Jack Dorsey intentionally trying to scare the daylights out of his investors? He has excelled at talking down expectations.</p><p>  Mike: It's interesting. On the one hand, you could see Dorsey's response as pragmatism: He came into a situation where the product is difficult to understand, people aren't coming to Twitter in droves, and it's not an overnight fix. He's trying to tell people that he's in it for the long haul, and things may sting for a while.</p><p>  But I think you're right, it has been a bit much with the doom and gloom of the last two earnings calls. Maybe next time he goes for something less David Lynch and more, uh, Steven Spielberg?</p><p>  Another thing I want to mention is this news about <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>Chrome operating system eventually becoming the same thing as its Android system. Or something like that. It's not clear, really, except to say that something is happening. Eventually.</p><p>  Let's step back a bit into super wonky nerd history. Once upon a time, Google had two nascent software projects: Chrome, a web browser, and Android, a mobile operating system. As with all successful things, they started small and grew into powerhouses in their own respective industries. <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>Chrome browser has eaten up tons of browser market share. And Android, as we all know, is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. Google did well for itself.</p><p>  So what? Well, The Wall Street Journal published an article on Thursday saying the two systems -- which have long been speculated to be on a collision course -- will eventually be folded together under the Android brand and operating system.</p><p>  I have my thoughts here. But since I talk a lot and we have this opportunity to hear from a wise and benevolent editor, you tell me if we should all freak out and start looting stores for the last remaining Chromebooks.</p><p>  Jim: Who said I'm benevolent? No need to freak out. Let's not confuse Chrome, the web browser I am now using, with Chrome OS, the other operating system at Google. Chrome OS was built on top of Chrome, the browser, but it is not the same as the browser. The browser known as Chrome is not going anywhere, and the operating system known as Chrome OS is also not going anywhere, according to people who are aware of these things but won't say it on the record. They're not killing it. At least not yet.</p><p>  What Google does plan to do is make sure Chromebooks can work on Android. Makes sense. Chrome OS was always a head-scratcher. It came out after Android and seemed to be competing with Android for oxygen at the Googleplex -- but Chrome OS lost. Google can't say, ''Hey, we're dumping Chrome OS'' because they've sold millions of Chromebooks into academia and people there would reasonably freak out if they did. What they can do, however, is create some sort of transition period between the two.</p><p>  A little side note: Sundar Pichai, who now manages the part of Alphabet (it's going to take a few years to get used to saying that) that is still called Google, ran development of Chrome OS in its early days. The man is clearly not a sentimentalist.</p><p>  Do you know anyone who owns a Chromebook?</p><p>  Mike: My mom loves Chromebooks! The last time I met Pichai I showed him a text from my mom who was going nuts over her Chromebook. He was psyched. It's basically an email and Internet machine, which is good for people who aren't editing video or killing zombies on a powerful PC.</p><p>  She has bought four of them in the past four years. My mom breaks things.</p><p>  Jim: Now let's talk about two things happening next week: Hewlett-Packard finally splits in two and San Francisco votes on wicked strict laws on Airbnb rentals.</p><p>  This election in San Francisco on Tuesday is going to be fascinating: It's like the whole city decided to vote on what it thinks of the tech industry in a bunch of propositions, not just the Airbnb regulations. My neighborhood does not have a big tech population, but where I used to live, in Noe Valley, has completely changed since I moved there in 2000. It's the new Pacific Heights. And for those of you who don't live in San Francisco (And why wouldn't you? It's really nice.), that means it has gotten insanely expensive. Is there still room in the city for people who don't expect to have an equity event?</p><p>  HP reminds me of the old Yankee Stadium. Sure, it was iconic and historic and all that, but chunks of cement were falling off the darn thing. HP is, as they say, the foundational Silicon Valley company. But it has been going through this ''who are we?'' corporate soul searching since the '90s. It has had a succession of C.E.O.s flame out spectacularly, and the amazing thing is it still employs 300,000 people. Will you be taking off your hat for a moment of silence Sunday when the old HP officially fades away?</p><p>  Mike: It's funny. I grew up with a Gateway, then a Compaq, then a Dell, and I think an HP before switching to Macbooks. So I have a bit of sentimentality around the decline and fall of a storied institution in need of a serious reset.</p><p>  That said, my HP printer in college was total garbage and the ink was a rip-off. So I'm not super broken up about it.</p><p>  O.K., thanks for stopping by, Jim! Let me know if you ever want to take over for Farhad again. Permanently.</p><p>  Jim: Thanks, Mike. This was fun. I hope our readers in San Francisco remember to vote Tuesday. By the way, beard oil?</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-094471151101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H8R-MRG1-JBG3-60K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1164\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/technology/mike-and-jims-week-in-tech-googles-new-version-of-android.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/technology/mike-and-jims-week-in-tech-googles-new-version-of-android.html</url><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 1, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>7974 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL3M</classCode><className>MOBILE GAMES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL3M</classCode><className>MOBILE GAMES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>PE000DFE4</classCode><className>JACK DORSEY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>PE0009TQX</classCode><className>STEVEN SPIELBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Good Tuesday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast, a blue chip earnings blitz today.  Six Dow components all  reporting their first-quarter earnings before the opening bell.   Caterpillar leader the way beating expectations on both profit and revenue  while also raising full year guidance.  The stock is up.  The strong  results looking to Dow futures indicating a pretty good rally at the start  of trading this morning.  This is right around the high of the morning up  150 points on the Dow two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds  of a percent as does the NASDAQ for the gain of 38 points right now.   Alphabet beating expectations on both profit and revenue last night, but  the company is raising concerns about expenses as we expected.  The stock  is down this morning, one half of one percent in the premarket. </p><p>Newer markets closed mostly lower yesterday weighed down by yields --  rising bond yields as the 10 year crept closer to three percent.  The DowIndustrials were down 14 points, fractional move on a percentage basis.   S&amp;P was up a fraction and the NASDAQ was down about a quarter of a percent,  17 points.  The Dow was down for a fourth day in a row.  That was the  longest losing streak since March.  In Europe this morning, the indices  look like with the FT-100 showing a gain of 25.  The CAC Quarante is up  fractionally and the DAX Index is up 28 points.  That's a quarter of a  percent higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks closing mostly higher with the  exception of Korea.  Best performer was Shanghai in China the top performer  up at two percent on the session.  In open book for the first time,  Facebook is revealing its secret rules for user posts where the company  says crosses the line.  And then a change of heart, Kentucky Senator Rand  Paul reversed his stance and cleared the way for President Trump's  Secretary of State nominee, Mike Pompeo. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  I've been  opposed to this nomination for a long time.  I hope that they'll let Trump  be Trump and that Pompeo will be a constructive influences and not a  destructive one.  But from what I've been told and listened to with  director I think that he is open and understands that his job is -- that  the president is his boss. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator Rand Paul coming up about  his Pompeo decision.  Join us at 8:30 this morning in about 30 minutes for  that special interview.  And then cashing in on the crypto craze, the  details as Goldman Sachs makes its first hire for the cryptocurrency  market.  All those stories coming up Tuesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, The King's College  Business Economics Professor Brian Brenberg, and Benchmark Managing Partner  Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes.  It's great to be here  especially during earnings week. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A third of the S&amp;P reporting earnings this week.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  And  having a little effect today.  The Dow is up.  There are some good news  coming already this morning.  Maybe CAC won't dominate the week.  Maybe  some of these bread and butter companies in the economy will dominate the - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you got Amazon coming out on Thursday.  You got Qualcomm  and Intel coming out tomorrow and Thursday. </p><p>KELLY:  And Pulte actually reported this morning and the home builders are  doing exceptionally well.  They've consistently beat.  There were worries  about, you know, with rising interest rates how that's going to affect.   But we have a limited supply of housing in the United States here.  It's a  big over hang and that's why you're seeing the rental markets still do well  in face of that. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  With home building and  construction they'll watch for rising import costs, watch for rising  inflation.  There were a bunch of stories being passed around last week  about condo developers killing projects and say Toronto because of the  rising material costs, and that was one of the things that fueled the move  out of treasury bonds here I think.  And, again, I think that if you -- if  you top 30 percent yield on 10 year could be very, very rough going through  the stock market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, I don't know why though.  I mean -- OK.  So it's  three percent but you're still talking about rock bottom numbers.  I mean  why would so afraid three percent. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- worrying about the Federal Reserve overreacting to inflation  concerns and they start worrying about you hit three, you start worrying  about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  It's a bigger percentage move to go from two percent to three  percent then three percent to four percent.  It's actually -- and in an  economy that's going to have over three percent GDP growth this year, you  look at the nominal grow -- I mean it's unbelievable. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's unprecedented unwinding of unprecedented stimulus  from our central bank and I don't think anybody knows how that's going to  end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many people have come on this program and said to us the  biggest risk to economic growth right now is the Federal Reserve?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We talked about it in last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big conversation this morning about all of the above.  Joining  the conversation Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul is with me today.  I will get his take on his last minute  reversal to vote in favor of Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State, the  budget, and a lot more.  Don't miss that special interview coming up.  But  first is our top story is earnings in focus, six Dow companies are  reporting earnings this morning including Travelers, 3M, Coca-Cola.  They  had mixed reports overall.  But United Technologies, Caterpillar, and  Verizon all beat on earnings and revenue for the first quarter and all of  those stocks are trading higher.  Caterpillar was one that was really  closely watched because that is a big indicator of global economic  activity.  Futures right now indicating a big gain at the start of trading.   Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points right out of the gate, two- thirds of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up half a percent right now, 35  points higher.  And joining us right now to talk more about all that is The  Gartman Letter Editor and Publisher Dennis Gartman.  Dennis, good to see  you sir.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE GARTMAN LETTER:  Always honored  to be on.  Thanks for asking me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get to the fundamentals if you will in terms of  earnings, let's talk technical because I know you like to look at the  charts.  What do the charts tell you right now, Dennis, in terms of where  we are in the stock market rally?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think it's -- it bothers me greatly that we have seen the  highs.  I'm quite convince in both the market here in the United States and  globally, so I'm actually in the long-term quite bearish of equities, I  think that we've got the monetary authorities here in the United States  already erring upon the side of tighter monetary policy.  We've seen the  adjusted monetary based on about 10 percent from its highs.  That's not  going to change anytime soon.  We're allowing the monetary base to roll  off.  We're probably going to see the ECB begin to tighten.  The only bank  of consequence that won't be tightening the monetary policy anytime soon is  the Bank of Japan and as long as the monetary authority is on balance are  beginning that process they're taking away the liquidity that has sponsored  the Bull market.  So technically, I'm actually quite bearish.  In the short  run, we got so terribly oversold two weeks ago that we're having a good  bounce.  We shouldn't be surprised by this, but if we took the Dow up  another 150 to 200, I guarantee you I shall be selling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget though that there's this narrative right now  that things aren't going to slow down.  Dagen, they've got this massive  balance to walk the Federal Reserve does.  Even Robert Kaplan from the  Dallas Federal Reserve last week said, he wants this two more rate hikes a  total of three for this year because while he's expecting 2.6 percent or  2.7 percent growth this year, he thinks growth plummets down to one and  three-quarters percent by the end of '19, so there's this narrative that  things are going to start slowing down in a big way. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's something -- that echoes how Stephanie Pomboy has  felt about this economy.  But to -- what we're talking about the Federal  Reserve winding down that balance sheet, that's -- they've laid out a plan  to do that.  And it would require something really extreme and dramatic in  the economy for them to change course at this point on that note.  And I  don't think people really understand what this economy looks like with the  markets look like without all of that buying by Federal Reserve, and one  thing I would just point out and it's to kind of pivot a little bit but  watch these NAFTA negotiations to sort of going on.  They resumed today  behind closed doors with Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative,  representatives from Canada and that's -- they're trying to do something by  the end of next week.  President Trump is threatening to change it or pull  out of it on his own, can he do it?  There's a lot of pushback in Congress.   Again, Europe and Mexico have just inked a trade deal.  We're getting left  behind and this could roil markets.  I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anything is going to roil markets if no NAFTA deal and if the  U.S. pulls out and then we've got no trade going on with China and Mexico.   I totally agree that the markets looking -- go ahead Dennis, jump in. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Well, yes.  We have to pay attention what's going on in the NAFTA  talks because what a lot of people are forgetting to understand is that  there's a presidential election coming up in Mexico on July 1st and the  fellow who's going to win that unless something untoward is to change is an  overt Marxist then we have to pay attention to that fact.  We need to get  this NAFTA agreement passed and passed very quickly, and if it doesn't pass  in the next two or three weeks or certainly in the next month then there's  trouble ahead.</p><p>KELLY:  Dennis, you think we've hit peak market right here and I think one  of the things to be cognizant of is that because of the multiples?  And you  don't think that we should be trading at 18 times earnings, maybe we should  be trading times 16 times earnings because we're anticipating to make 150  some dollars this year in earnings on the S&amp;P 500, next year 170, so the  earning story is going to get better, but are what you're saying -- are you  saying that people aren't going to be willing to pay up for that? </p><p>GARTMAN:  I think 18 times earnings is relatively high.  We could get to 20  times earnings.  I don't -- I don't doubt that for a moment.  But what  bothers me and what people are not paying attention to is historically,  stock markets do indeed make their highs long before economic activity  turns down.  What ends up happening at the bottom is the monetary  authorities begin to impact expansionary.  That money moves into equities  before it moves into planned equipment and labor, and at the peak as plant,  and equipment, and labor demands capital back, and while the monetary  authorities are beginning to tighten, there is less -- there is less  liquidity to sponsor plant equipment and labor, and so the money comes out  of the stock market.  It's very normal. </p><p>It's very historically unprecedented and I think that that's indeed what's  going to be happening here over the course of next year or two.  So yes,  the economy in the United States doing quite well.  I do not doubt that for  a moment.  It's going to continue to do well for another year or two, but  it's going to be very difficult unless the monetary authorities become  expansionary once again and they shall not do that, Dagen, I think it's  absolutely right.  They've laid out the plans very clearly as to how  they're going to run off or allow these -- the debt securities - the  treasury's that they own to run off out of maturity.  They're not going to  be expansionary and that's going to be contractionary for the equities over  time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to do then?  What do you do about the  portfolio then, Dennis?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think you go to cash.  I think you go to short-term treasury  securities.  I think you go to the ETF's that are short-term bond funds and  I think you sit on the sidelines and wait.  I think sometimes the sidelines  is not a bad place to be, not too many people want to always be 100 percent  invested.  As I've said in my newsletter in a bear market, there are three  positions you can have, very bearish, modestly bearish or neutral, right  now, perhaps neutrality is the best position of all to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Dennis, always great  insights from you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Well, see you soon, sir, Dennis Gartman  there.  President Trump will host French president Emmanuel Macron  meanwhile at a state dinner tonight.  But the Iran nuclear deal will be top  of this agenda ahead of the festivities.  Blake Burman at the White House  right now with the latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  There is already that dinner last night.  The official state  dinner is later this evening and in between later this morning will be the  official bilateral meeting between President Trump and Emmanuel Macron.  A  host of different issues on the plate for the two world leaders, but non- possibly bigger than the Iran nuclear deal.  The White House is standing  behind its stance that the president believes this is a bad deal.  He has a  decision to make about whether to stay in or possibly get out by May 12th.   Ahead of the visit, Macron was saying that the president should not leave  the Iran nuclear deal if there is not a Plan B.  Iran's Foreign Minister  agreed and the Iranian president now has sent out this warning saying and,  \"If someone wants to betray our nation and the deal, grave consequences  will affect them.\"  The Press Secretary yesterday Sarah Sanders was  noncommittal about the possibility of a realistic Plan D. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does the White House believe that there is actually a  realistic Plan B out there? </p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We certainly think that there  should be a better deal one that actually is positive that works.  And we  don't really typically look to the leadership in Iran to determine what our  foreign policy is. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Beyond that Maria, they will -- are expected President Trump and  Macron to be discussing trade issues, of course, the situation inside  Syria, and also the Paris Climate Accord.  Once Macron wraps up his visit  here at White House, he's not over here in Washington, D.C. because  tomorrow he will address Congress, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the joint session of Congress tomorrow.  Blake will be  watching that as well.  Thanks so much.  Blake Burman at the White House.   Coming up, Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo wins support of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee after Senator Rand Paul changes his  mind.  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator about why he flipped his vote  coming up.  And then Goldman Sachs jumps on the Bitcoin bandwagon, the  company's new higher in the cryptocurrency market right here next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Police in Toronto is still searching for motive  in yesterday's deadly van rampage.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police  have identified the suspect who drove that van, 25-year-old Alek Minassian  of Toronto.  He's currently under arrest charge with killing 10 people and  injuring 15 others.  Witnesses said it was chaos. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He just went on the sidewalk.  He just started hitting  everybody -- a bus stop everything got shattered because there are a lot of  people got hurt.  I've seen the scene I've never seen in my life. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Officials are still trying to determine his motive but they say so  far there's no evidence the attack is linked to terrorism.  This happened  while foreign ministers leading G7 nations or holding talks in Toronto.   Well, former President George H. W. Bush has been hospitalized just one day  after the funeral for his wife Barbara.  According to Houston Methodist  Hospital, the 93-year-old Bush is being treated for an infection that has  spread to his blood.  A spokesman says Bush is responding to treatment and  appears to be recovering.  Well, Goldman Sachs reportedly is getting  serious about investing in digital currency.  They've just hired Justin  Schmidt as the first cryptocurrency trader for the market unit.  This comes  as Goldman is looking to set up a trading desks to actually trade  cryptocurrency. </p><p>Goldman already handles trades the Bitcoin futures for some clients.   Morgan Stanley does the same.  Shares of Goldman are down one percent so  far this year.  And then Maria, take a look at this birdie that this golfer  did not want.  A Michigan high school student was about to tee off when a  goose attacked him on the course.  It turns out this goose was sitting on  her egg in a nest decided to do to defend herself.  He fell over.  Only his  ego was bruised.  These birds are mean, Maria.  We had one on our farm in  Texas and that goose at the time when I was a kid attacked me and bit me.   Watch out for these things. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, knocked him right over. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Respect for the goose.  Respect for the goose.  I worked on a  golf course.  You know what, you're in their territory.  You better getting  -- </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the mama was protecting her --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holly Mollie.  OK.  Coming up heroism in the face of tragic.   We'll speak with James Shaw Jr. live.  Yes, the courageous man who stopped  the Waffle House shooter.  He's coming up next.  And then another big day  of earnings, Verizon one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell.   The company beat first quarter earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll  break down the numbers coming up.  And in roughly 10 minutes, I'll speak  with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member Rand Paul.   Join us with the senator coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The man accused of killing four people at a  Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee this weekend is expected to make his  first appearance in court this morning after police in Tennessee arrested  him yesterday ending a nearly 36 hour  manhunt.  The accused gunman 29- year-old Travis Reinking opened fire with an assault style rifle early  Sunday morning fatally wounding four people in and outside the restaurant  before a customer intervened, James Shaw Jr. managed to tackle the gunman  and wrestle away his rifle.  Undoubtedly saving more lives.  Joining us  right now is the hero himself, Waffle House help James Shaw Jr.  Mr. Shaw,  thank you so much for joining us this morning and congratulations and thank  you to you.</p><p>JAMES SHAW JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  Thank you for inviting me and having me  on your show. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just incredible what you did.  Tell us what was going  through your mind.  Was this just an immediate reaction, you saw what was  happening and you just jumped to try to tackle this guy?  What happened? </p><p>SHAW:  So by the time he entered, I was -- he had already shot towards the  bathroom and that's when a bullet grazed my upper -- I have to try to -- in  this situation.  And then once I noticed that he was refilling -- reloading  the gun --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reloading, yes.</p><p>SHAW:  Yes, reloading his gun.  The barrel was down and I just choose then  to, you know, my opportunity to attack because I didn't see like I was  going to have another window.</p><p>BRENBERG:  James, Brian Brenberg here.  Thank you for everything you did.   One of the things I really appreciated about how you reflected on this as  you said, look, I was actually just trying to save my own life.  I wasn't  trying to be a hero necessarily, you know, was it really just in that  moment, you know, I'm in danger, what do I have to do?  Did you see others  around you at all and think about what can I do to maybe, you know, create  a solution for the folks in this dinner as well?  How are you thinking  about that? </p><p>SHAW:  So when he -- like I said when he first started coming in, he shot  towards the bathroom and there were -- there was probably six or seven of  us in the separate bathrooms in the men or women's bathroom, however, I was  actually in the hallway because I didn't want to go in the bathroom because  there's -- I mean there's only one way out.  So I didn't want to go in the  bathroom, so I just went to keep an eye on him and then it worked out in my  favor because I saw him reloading and I just made it up in my mind that if  he was going to kill me he was going to have to work for this kill, and I'm  grateful, and very glad that I did do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean do you understand how many people you saved because  later they found all of these bullets and magazines in his pocket, he was  pretty locked and loaded and could have killed a lot of people that day?</p><p>SHAW:  Right.  That's the, you know, the day it happened, of course, I  didn't know that he had all that in his jacket pocket.  But I was -- I was  guessing that he did have, you know, was going to reload or do something,  so I'm glad that I intervened and I'm glad to have saved myself and saved  everybody else also.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was he naked?  Was he naked, James, because he did -- he got  out of the car initially naked with the green jacket, right? </p><p>SHAW:  Yes, he was he was naked.  He was only wearing the green jacket,  yes, ma'am. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, how -- this is Dagen McDowell, how has this changed your  outlook on life say human nature? </p><p>SHAW:  So after I visited some of the victims that were in critical  condition at Vanderbilt Hospital, they are now in stable condition now.  I  want to go and get something to eat at Panera Bread and, now, instead of me  looking for the exit, I actually completely sat beside the exit.  When I  was walking downtown for another interview, I can't help but not look -- I  mean look over my shoulder.  It's just, you know, right now, it's hard for  me to trust strangers because of this incident because it makes it really,  really tough to trust that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  James, it's so wonderful to have you on the show.  Thank  you.  We owe you a debt all of us do, and we love you James.  Thank you so  much.  You're a hero.  </p><p>SHAW:  All right.  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Shaw Jr. joining us there.  Congratulations, sir.  Coming  up, I'll speak with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul.  He weighs in on the Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, tax  reform, and a lot more.  Rand Paul right after this break.  And then  Caterpillar, one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell this  morning, the equipment company beat first quarter earnings and revenue  estimates.  We break down the other blue chip results after this.  Back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  The blue chip buzz on  Wall Street.  Six Dow components all reporting earnings before the opening  bell this morning.  Caterpillar leading the way beating expectations on  profit and revenue also raising its full-year guidance.  The stock is up  better than four percent.  United Technologies and Verizon also delivering  a double beat on revenue as well as profits.  The numbers are lifting the  stocks involved, although 3M is down four percent on the opposite.  Futures  however showing a big gain at the start of trading this morning.  </p><p>Take a look, Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points at the open,  that's two-thirds of one percent.  We got the S&amp;P 500 up 15 and the NASDAQ  up 32 points, that's also one-half of one percent.  In Europe this morning,  the indices are higher across the board.  FT-100 up 26 points, the CAC  Quarante up a half a point, and the DAX Index in Germany up just four  points, fractional moves for most of these indices.  In Asia overnight,  stocks closed mostly higher.  The Shanghai Composite in China, the best  performer, up nearly two percent overnight.</p><p>Kicking off this half an hour, a hurdle cleared on the CIA Director Mike  Pompeo's nomination to be Secretary of State.  The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee approved the nomination with a vote of 11 to nine.  This coming  after a key holdout changed his mind in the 11th hour.  Joining me right  now in a first on Fox Business interview, member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  Senator Paul, good to  see you, Sir, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you change your mind?</p><p>PAUL:  You know, I think we've been at war for too long and too many places  and I think the President tends to agree with me, but I wanted him to be  surrounded by advisers who also agree with the President.  You know, the  President said very clearly the Iraq war was a mistake.  I think the Iraq  war is part of the most instructive foreign policy disaster of the last  couple decades, and we should learn from it, and I kept asking Director  Pompeo, was the Iraq war a mistake, do you agree with the President?  I  wasn't getting a good answer, but finally, over the last few days, I got  more a succinct answer from both the President and from Director Pompeo and  a promise that he will be very public with saying that he does agree with  the President's vision of the world.  I think that combined with fact that  the President now has opened the door to negotiations with North Korea and  that Pompeo is part of that.  All of that figured into it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I was reading your tweets yesterday, I guess,  after you had a meeting with the President and you said that based on your  conversation, you believed that Secretary Pompeo agreed with the President  that, in fact, less entanglements is better than more entanglements.</p><p>PAUL:  I guess it's a good way to put it in general.  We're probably not  all in exactly the same place.  I'm ready to leave Afghanistan yesterday.   I wouldn't send one more soldier there.  I don't think they're exactly  there but I think even Pompeo in his written questions admitted there is no  military solution to Afghanistan.  And my point is if there's no military  solution, why would you send one more young man or woman over there to risk  their life? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand what you're saying, but then there's  Syria, and the President recently said, look, we're going to be taking our  men and women home from Syria relatively soon.  And that created a lot of  upset, because even people like General Jack Keane, four-star general,  says, look if you pull out of Syria right now, you're going to have a  vacuum just the way we pulled out of Iraq and ISIS will get stronger.  Do  you disagree with that, Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Yes, this is -- absolutely disagree with it.  This is the answer of  all the neo-cons, they want to stay everywhere and they predict profound,  you know, disaster if we ever leave.  But that's an answer -- that's a sort  of response that has a staying everywhere all of the time, so no.  I think  Syria should be -- I think one of the ideas that's been floated is having  more local countries participate in it.  The people who live there ought to  be manning the armies.  We live thousands of miles away.  We shouldn't have  to occupy and keep the peace in every country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, fair enough, but do you agree that when President Obama  pulled out of Iraq, it created a vacuum and created ISIS.</p><p>PAUL:  No, I would say that when we attacked Saddam Hussein and toppled  him, we created a vacuum and a crisis and chaos there, and it's persistent  to this day.  When you look at ISIS and where ISIS actually arose, ISIS  arose in the civil war of Syria not in Iraq.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Senator, did the President make any promises to you as far  as pulling out of Syria?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we talked more in general terms and I don't think it's  really appropriate to try to pin him down on, hey, we have to leave by next  week or I'm not voting for him.  But I heard loud and clear from the  President, and I tell you, loud and clear, and with very specific language,  that he's very much in my -- you know, with me on a lot of the ideas that  we've been at war too long in too many places.  And I think people are  going to be surprised over the next year or two that I think there will be  some ending of some of the wars around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the issues, of course, with that omnibus bill  recently was the fact that this is a $1.3-trillion omnibus bill, but the  fact that the GOP wanted to protect the military.  And that's why we ended  up spending all of that money which, of course, was really an issue for a  lot of conservatives, you included.</p><p>PAUL:  I think it's -- yes, I think it's probably the opposite, though, I  think if you spend yourself into a $22-trillion debt, you actually make  your country weaker.  So, I disagree with those people who say, oh, we got  to expand, we got to give a blind check to the military.  I think it's  actually making us weaker as we go further and further into debt.  So, I  think our national security is best protected by not having our mission too  large.  I think our mission is too large or in too many countries.  We  don't have left -- money left over to upgrade our nuclear arsenal, upgrade  our missile defenses and to actually pay our troops better.  So, I would do  all those things but I would do it and pay for it by actually not being in  Afghanistan and spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that we should have disallowed the government  to close down then for this omnibus?  Because House Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy was in the studio here yesterday and he takes aim at your chamber  for the massive amount of spending.  Listen to this, Sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  (INAUDIBLE) why you  even got into an omni.  The House did all the work.  We passed all 12 of  our appropriation bills.  The challenge was the minority in the Senate, not  voting against the appropriation bill, but voting against to even allow it  to come up to be debated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, your reaction?</p><p>PAUL:  Some true and some untrue.  We actually I don't think ever  filibustered an appropriation bill in the last year.  We didn't bring them  up, so the Senate did not do a shot.  The appropriation bill were not  brought forward in a timely fashion one at a time, but I don't believe  there was ever (AUDIO GAP) hearing them as much as I'm against spending I  typically will vote not to filibuster spending bills and to actually hear  the spending bills.  So, true and not so true, what he said.  But I do  think that the point is that we're spending too much money on what the  leadership in the House are bragging about that they put forward, was a  disaster to conservatives because it was a gross overspending of money and  spending of money.  We're actually going to have a trillion-dollar deficit  this year as bad as Obama.  That's what we ran against.  So, I think it's a  great deal of hypocrisy going on right now with the Republican leadership,  allowing and actually supporting budgets that we railed against when they  were President Obama's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I want to talk to you about your penny plan but  before I get there, do you -- are you in favor of this rescission plan to  actually rescind some of the spending?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  I haven't seen exactly what's in it, so we need to know  what's in it before we decide how to vote on it but actually (INAUDIBLE)  clawing back and spending less money is what I've been pitching for a long  time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about your penny plan to balance the federal budget?   Tell us about it.</p><p>PAUL:  The penny plan, I think, is easier to get broad bipartisan support  for because it doesn't cut all of one program, it cuts one percent of every  program, and frankly, I think there's enough waste even in the military to  cut one percent of it, and make government more efficient.  The only way  you'll ever get rid of waste in government is to give them less funds.  If  you say, oh, we've got waste, we're going to cut waste next year but we're  going to give you a hundred billion dollars more in the Pentagon, there  won't be any waste cut.  If we give you one percent less, they'll be waste  cut, but if you cut one percent a year, the penny plan, for five years, the  budget actually balances.  I've introduced that now and we will force a  vote on the Senate.  In the next week or two, we will get a vote on my  budget, and also have reconciliation instructions to allow a simple  majority in the Senate to vote to expand health savings accounts to every  American.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, is spending on the wall in your budget because it's  pretty extraordinary that we're talking about a $47-trillion budget here  and there wasn't even a $25 billion that the President wanted for his wall?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we have to have border security and it is part of our  national security to have border security.  I think we can debate on how  much it should cost.  Some of the estimates of $20 million a mile, I think,  are outlandish.  And I think we can also use technology.  I've met some  young inventors who talked about using sonar and cameras and other things  that really wouldn't be a wall for 2000 miles.  I think we can use walls in  some of the urban areas, but I think, really, we ought to use technology.   It's much less expensive in many of the other areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, did you discuss this with the President yesterday?</p><p>PAUL:  We didn't talk about the wall so much.  We really talked about his  vision of the world and war.  His concern for the veterans, he talked about  his trips with Walter Reed and talked about, you know, meeting the veterans  and being affected the same way all of us are as we see these young men who  have sacrificed so much.  And that's why I say not one soldier more.  I  mean, if there's no military mission, if there -- you know, there's no  military mission left really in Syria for goodness sakes, it's going to be  a political solution, same with Yemen, same with Afghanistan.  So, if these  are going to be political solutions, let's quit sending our soldiers there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about what Lindsey Graham says, and that is, look,  you may be tired of fighting with the extremists but guess what, they're  not tired of fighting with you.</p><p>PAUL:  He's been wrong about every foreign policy sort of pronouncement of  the last 40 years.  He's a neoconservative who really doesn't have concern  for the constitution or the bill of rights but really wants to be at war  everywhere.  And I think the wars are bankrupting us and I think sometimes  you create more terrorists than you kill.  If you want to go to every  remote village in Africa and kill a chieftain over there and say, oh, we  got somebody from Al-Qaeda, well, you create 10 for every you kill.  So, I  think he's been wrong about most things like this, and I think people would  be wise to think through what he's been saying because it's bankrupting our  country and it's a terrible foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know that there are a number of programs going  bankrupt like entitlements like Social Security, like Medicare, like  Medicaid.  Now, we're getting new details about a phase two tax cut plan.   I spoke with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady earlier  this morning, here's what he said.  Listen to this, Senator. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  This  year, we're looking at issues like, can we help families save more and  earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in the  United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not yet  permanent provisions of the tax cut?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's talking about make things permanent like the individual  tax cuts, like the expensing, would you support a phase two tax cut plan,  Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  And I think this is something, you know, many of the  Democrats were complaining and saying, oh, the tax cuts are not going to be  permanent, so it's not really going to help individuals.  Well, I think  we'd like to make it permanent and if the Democrats would join with us, I  think we could make the individual tax side permanent.  And really, the  individual side is where we really helped a lot of the working class out  with this recent tax cut.  So, making that permanent would be a huge step  forward, and hopefully, the Democrats who criticized us over that will join  us to make it permanent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see where that leads.  And real quick,  finally, Iran's President, Senator, is warning that the U.S. is going to  see grave consequences if Washington withdraws from the 2015 Iran nuclear  deal.  This coming as the French President Emmanuel Macron is said to hold  talks with the President today over that nuclear deal and threats from  North Korea and Syria.  Macron wants to urge the President to not withdraw  from the controversial agreement.  Your expectation, Sir.</p><p>PAUL:  I think the most important thing is, is Iran adhering to the  agreement, and so far, all indications have been that they adhered to it.   I don't think it was the best agreement in the world, and I think we could  have done better, but we have the agreement.  It is a multilateral  agreement in the sense that many other countries joined with us in the  agreement, so I think it would be a mistake to exit hastily from it,  particularly if Iran is adhering to it.  Now, there's a more complicated  arms race going on in the Middle East, and people have to realize that Iran  reacts to Saudi Arabia, that is their rival in the region.  So, when we  sell $300 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Iran will react and  continue to develop their weapons.  So, people have to realize that it is  an action and a reaction, and that it can't be seen just as, oh, here is  evil, Iran, and they're creating weapons.  Well, they're doing it in  response to Saudi Arabia, back-and-forth.  Who started it?  I don't know,  but it is an arms race. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Senator, it's good to see you, Sir.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>PAUL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great conversation.  Senator Rand Paul joining us there in  Washington.  Coming up, Coca-Cola one of six Dow companies reporting before  the opening bell this morning.  The company beat earnings and revenue  expectations due in part to a Diet Coke reboot.  Stuart Varney will weigh  in on the earnings split this morning.  Then retirement realities, the  shocking study that says your employer could be to blame for limited  retirement savings.  We'll get into it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're covering earnings.  The story on Wall  Street this morning, Caterpillar lifting the Dow Industrials after a  stronger-than-expected first quarter.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of  the New York Stock Exchange with the breakdown.  Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  thus far, we've seen earnings coming in, 19 percent of the S&amp;P 500  companies have come in, and you have 78 percent of those beat again  earnings per share.  And let's put Caterpillar right in there, it's been a  busy earnings week.  Stock is up 3.6 percent, beating on both the top and  bottom line.  We saw profit sales and also the full-year outlook also  raised.  So, you have a beat across the board here for Caterpillar, higher  demand, better-than-expected sales.  We heard from Citigroup yesterday.   They did put a buy rating on this particular stock.  They added nearly  11,000 jobs, and the increased volume helped to boost total sales by 38  percent.  I will note that the stock is down about nine percent since its  last quarter, concerns about the trade dispute.  Trade worries have  certainly hit some stocks.  </p><p>Then, we take a look at another mover, and that is Wells Fargo.  Wells  Figer (ph) -- Fargo, right now, is up about a half of one percent.  But  today is the shareholder meeting, it's in Des Moines, Iowa, not in San  Francisco.  There would have been even more protesters, activists.  You  know, regulators have been on this.  The Trump administration has been  tough on this one, fining Wells Fargo a billions dollars for the car  insurance and mortgage abuses, but it was a year and a half ago, for fake  accounts, millions of them, and today, the activists and the shareholders  are going to get in there and voice their opinion.  They're calling for the  CEO to be fired and for the board to be removed, and even a breakup of it  because they believe it's too big and too bloated.  Of course, Wells Fargo  saying that they've been doing all that they can and they want to listen  and make some more changes.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Nicole, thank you.  Coca-Cola  seeing a nice pop this morning after beating expectations on its profit and  revenue estimates.  The sales surged following the company's risky Diet  Coke reboot.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney  to weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's what got me, Maria.  If  you look inside that earnings report from Coca-Cola, there's something very  interesting going on.  Five percent organic growth.  Now, Maria, you know I  hate this jargon stuff.  I take that as growth from the inside of the  company, as opposed to growth by acquisition.  Five percent growth for a  health and beverage company, I should say a beverage company is very  unusual.  Turns out that Diet Coke was the driver of this organic growth.   And Coke Zero was a close second.  It's expanding at a double-digit rate.   Apparently, I don't -- I never touch this stuff, but apparently, they've  got all kinds of brand-new flavors, like ginger, and apparently, that's a  really big deal.  And up goes their earnings, up goes the stock, I think  that's a cultural phenomenon because we always thought that soda, classic  soda, sugar-water was going out, and so it is, but flavored drinks with no  sugar, apparently are doing very well.  I think that's a cultural shift on  the part of the millennials.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true because people are trying to avoid sugar, so they  figured a way around it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's it.  That's it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coca-Cola did.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink that stuff?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's nice to see that kind of innovation from within,  you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't.  I don't drink soda but I used to drink Diet Coke and  that was my favorite soda, Diet Coke, but I haven't had it in years.</p><p>VARNEY:  As long as it's got caffeine in it, that's why I drink Mountain  Dew, OK?  That's it.  You (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My coffee does that for me.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, great to see you.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  We can discuss this endlessly, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But I know you've got a lot out on the Macron visit,  so we're going to be there in 10 minutes, Stu, thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart as he looks into that meeting between the  President and President Macron.  First though, could your boss be to blame  for lack of retirement savings.  Details on the shocking study that could  affect your financial future, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans struggling with savings for the  golden years, one in three people have nothing stashed away for retirement,  nothing, according to gobankingrates.com.  Just over half have saved less  than $10,000.  Now, a new study suggest their employers may be partially to  blame.  Joining us now, the author of \"Retire Inspired\" and Ramsey  Solutions' Financial Expert, Chris Hogan.  Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, only 59 percent of Americans have access to a 401(k) plan  through their employer.  Is that the issue?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the bigger issue is really, Maria, people understanding just  how important it is that we take steps to be able to help ourselves.  So, I  think it's less about trying to blame the employer, if they don't have  access and it's more about taking personal responsibility.  Victim-thinking  is a dangerous think in this country, but we have to do is have personal  responsibility.  And people are doing it, they're waking up and they're  starting to listen as I travel and speak around the country.  They just  need to know what steps to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, bottom line, if you don't have access to a 401(k), open an  IRA?</p><p>HOGAN:  That's exactly correct.  And think of an IRA as just an account, an  arrangement that allows you to save for yourself with stocks, bonds, mutual  funds, but people don't know what steps to take and where to go.  So, I  want them to reach out, talk to an investment professional, really start to  sit down and understand the landscape, your goals, your timing, as well as  your opportunities, and we can start to take steps in the right direction.</p><p>KELLY:  Chris, one of the best things you could do is open up a Roth IRA,  if you're -- if you're a younger investor because it's after tax money, it  grows tax free, and it's -- they're -- it's easy to invest in.  Are you  seeing people to utilize Roth IRAs?</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, Roth IRAs are a beautiful thing, and you're right, it is  after-tax dollars, so it gives you tax-free growth.  More and more people  are hearing this and waking up to it.  I'm getting calls into show \"Retire  Inspired\" where young people, 23, 24 years old are asking about it, but at  the same time, I'm hearing from people in their 50s and 60s that didn't  understand what was at stake and what they could do.  So, yes, we need to  keep spreading the word and helping people understand the tools that they  have available to them.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Chris, what's the biggest misconception people have about IRAs  that keep them from investing?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the biggest misconception is that people don't understand how  easy it is to open, they think it's a -- it's a very difficult complex  process, and it's really not.  It's a matter of a couple documents and then  you starting to fund it.  So, people understanding how easy it is I think  it allowed them to take more advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always great advice.  Pay yourself first, that means save first  before you spend.  Chris, thank you so much, great to see you, Sir.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you, ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris Hogan.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star  panel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some breaking news on United Technologies.  Not only  did it beat expectations, the company is just saying that it will  repatriate $3.8 billion from overseas to the United States.  That,  obviously, is exactly what the President wanted from his tax cut plan.   United Technologies will repatriate that money in overseas cash as a result  of the tax cut plan.  </p><p>Final thoughts from this all-star panel, right now.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  We're focusing on tech earnings.  Do you focus on the e-commerce,  the ecosystem, and look at the companies that service them?  Industrial  (INAUDIBLE) have done exceptionally well, Prologis last week actually  talked about how they're growing 25 percent.  So, if you can't get your  returns in tech, get the companies that are the backbones for them.  Stuff  from (INAUDIBLE) data centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Brian?  Brian?</p><p>BRENBERG:  You can talk a lot about cloud computing today.  I think it's  going to be a big week for Microsoft, for Amazon, too, that's a growing  business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And credit to Kevin, he turned me on to highball  energy drinks and I used to dismiss them.  And so, his feelings were hurt.   That, and making fun of you earlier about the --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KELLY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, April 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Blue chips buzz on Wall Street, earnings for six Dow components all due out  before the opening bell this morning.  That's in the next two hours.</p><p>Travelers, Coca-Cola, United Technologies just hitting the wire; Coke and  United both beating expectations with their first quarter numbers.   Travelers is coming in mixed, missing on profit.  Take a look at the stocks  right after the numbers are released.  Coca-Cola shares up 1 percent,  United Technologies up one and two-thirds percent, travelers shares down  three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>Check futures this morning.  We are expecting a pretty good rally at the  start of trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 140 points, two- thirds of 1 percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds and the Nasdaq is up two- thirds of 1 percent with a 45-point move.</p><p>This after yesterday when markets closed mostly lower, weighed down by  rising bond yields.  The Dow down for a fourth session in a row, the  longest losing streak since March.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this, take a look.  FT  100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris is flat and the DAX index  in Germany up a quarter of a percent as well.</p><p>Revenues at Travelers were above estimates, by the way, as you see there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly higher.  The shanghai composite the  top performer, up nearly 2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour -- tackling tax cuts phase two as voters  head to the polls this fall for the midterm elections.</p><p>Republicans are hoping to pass another round of tax cuts later this year.   A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that more people view the  Republican tax overhaul as a bad idea, rather than a good one.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas.  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Good morning --  Marie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it amazing to you that we get this poll where it says  that these people -- most people are not seeing the tax plan as a positive?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Well, I think the narrative has been just so brutal for the  past year.  But when they asked the questions, Maria, you get different  answers.  When you ask people you want to keep -- should you be able to  keep more of what you worked so hard to earn, you want to see the standard  deduction doubled, do you want to get more help raising your kids, do you  want to see those paychecks rise?  The answer invariably is yes.</p><p>I think just a general comment you sometimes get a different answer.  But  back home, I can tell you Main Street optimism is at an all-time high.   People are really appreciating just keeping more of what they earn.  And  now, we're seeing dollars come back overseas being invested in America,  exactly the opposite of what we've seen for two decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  So I think that it's very positive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a very powerful legislation.  We know.  We've  seen already a big impact with animal spirits really moving in the  corporate sector.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about phase two.  Do you want to do a phase two  tax cut plan?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I do.  And it's probably different than what most people  think.  We want to change the culture in Washington where once every 30  years we reform the tax code and in between we fall farther behind and we  just do a lot of special breaks.</p><p>We're talking about trying to do what businesses do, which is every year  Congress look at the tax code, ask themselves can we be more competitive as  a country?  Can we be innovative?  Can we be better?  Can we stretch  paychecks farther?</p><p>So this year we're looking at issues like can we help families save more  and earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in  the United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not  yet permanent provisions of the tax code?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to make the cuts for personal permanent.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think that ought to be done.  And I also think there's a 2.0  and a 3.0.  And my point is like businesses, continually getting better  every year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It will evolve?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in terms of expensing and the corporate sector -- what do  you want to see done in terms of business cuts?  </p><p>BRADY:  I have no doubt that that will be made permanent.  The question is  when.  We'll just find the right timing for it because we've already seen  investment unleashed, you know, throughout the economy, because businesses  large and small are now able to write those off, those capital investments  the year they buy them.  It's really powerful.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do about spending, Mr. Chairman?  I mean  we've seen reports in the last few weeks that President Trump wants to claw  back as much as $60 billion from the $1.3 trillion omnibus.  Yesterday we  had Kevin McCarthy in the chair here saying that look, the rescission is  not about the omnibus, it's about looking for revenue that's not used but  you voted for that massive spending bill.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of complaining about that $1.3 million bill.  What are  you going to do about it?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I think that omnibus was about historic rebuilding of  America's national defense -- exactly what we needed to do.  But it's also  a symbol of a broken budget system for more than a decade.  The House is  passing these bills separately in a small way.  The Senate is not able to  pass any.  And so we end up with something no one wants.</p><p>So I think -- I welcome these rescissions.  I think we ought to wake up  every day, looking at wasteful spending, things that aren't a priority, and  so I think these rescissions and this process is a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  So do you think that we will in fact see it?  Because  Mitch McConnell told Neil Cavuto recently it's not even on the table.   We're not going to look at any -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it ought to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're not bringing it to the floor.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think it ought to be.  I think we're -- look I think we're  spending too much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  There is wasteful spending.  That omnibus is because the system is  broken.  And so let's do what we can now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you didn't want to shut down the government.  You didn't  think so enough to say look, I'm not signing this.  </p><p>BRADY:  No.  And look, at the end of the day, I think President Reagan had  two big legacies -- tax reform and rebuilding the military.  So that's  exactly what we're doing in the first two years of President Trump -- tax  reform and rebuilding our national security.  That's important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- there's a narrative out there right now that  things will begin to slow down in 2019.  I spoke with the president of the  Dallas Federal Reserve who said look, yes, we're looking for 2.7 percent  economic growth this year but by the time '19 going into '20 comes along  we're talking about growth of 1.75 percent.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>BRADY:  No, I don't.  Look I think there's been sort of an economic  narrative that America has to settle for this 2 percent growth.  We've seen  that.  It's why we drove tax reform is to break out of that sort of  sluggish economy.</p><p>And so no, I see the economy moving.  But I'll tell you there's two things  we need to do right to maximize off this tax reform.  One -- we need more  customers, that's free trade including a modern NAFTA.</p><p>And second, we need a better workforce.  Because I'll guarantee you, all  across the country companies large and small are turning away work because  they don't have the workforce they need.  That's something the House and  Congress need to address.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the reason that I raise it -- so many people are  expecting that we're going to see better growth numbers continue and that  will pay some part of the tab for the tax cut bill.  And Nancy Pelosi and  the others said it's absolutely BS that anything's going to pay for itself.  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, listen, she is exactly wrong and has been throughout this  whole process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she has.</p><p>BRADY:  And she really misled the American voters about the tax relief they  give but even -- even if you accept the Congressional Budget Office's  numbers, even they admitted revenues will grow after tax reform.  They  increase by a trillion dollars.  So on a static basis, two-thirds of it is  already -- will be recouped already and that's under economic growth I  think that will be ultimately higher than what they predict.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington for  the state visit for the Trump presidency.  The President of France is set  to address a joint session of Congress tomorrow.  What would you like to  hear from the president of France?  </p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it's important for us to have national security  alliances.  That's very important.  We saw the importance of that in Syria.</p><p>Secondly, trade alliances.  Look we do need a modern trading relationship  with all of Europe.  France could play a key role in that.  And so I'd like  to see those ties strengthen as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to see bilateral deals, U.S.-France, U.S.-U.K.?  Is  that the kind of trade story you're talking about?  </p><p>BRADY:  You know, I would like to see more regional (ph) ones because I  think you've been just like -- whether you sell your products to one  business or sell them to a chain with a hundred stores, I like the regional  approach.  But President Trump likes that country by country, believes we  can get better concessions that way.</p><p>So you know, I think they deserve a chance to show that can create the jobs  we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we in NAFTA?  Do you know?  I mean recently Vice  President Mike Pence said look, we're going to be close.  But I keep  questioning it because I know that there are elections in Mexico this  summer.  Are we going to be able to do a deal, get something done, even a  blueprint of a new NAFTA deal before those Mexico elections?  </p><p>BRADY:  I think we can.  I know that the U.S. under Bob Lighthizer, Mexico  and Canada want an agreement.  They've done an awful lot of good work.</p><p>I was down in Mexico City for the seventh negotiating round.  I think  they're very close.  I think at the end of the day, people are debating  what's the best strategy going forward.  I think the best strategy is  deliver to Congress a modern NAFTA that creates more jobs and allows us to  sell more made in America products in Mexico and Canada, that's the best  strategy for the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So far House Speaker Paul Ryan says that he's endorsing  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to replace him when he retires.  Here's what  McCarthy said yesterday about that endorsement when he joined us on the  program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Our top leader has  endorsed but the most important thing here is we have to make sure there's  an opportunity for a Republican to even run for Speaker next year.</p><p>So we have our work cut out for us.  We have a great team in this  conference.  We're fighting hard.  We've got a lot of successes.  But we've  got a November election to go forward.  So it's a little premature -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So look, premature or not, will you support Kevin McCarthy?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Look, I think Kevin McCarthy's done an amazing job.  I think  what Kevin just said there is as a conference, focus on our work, preserve  this majority.  You know, he's going to have an opportunity to show the  great leadership he's done as majority leader, transfers to the  speakership.  We've got to work together to make sure we're competing for a  Speaker's race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to hold on to the majority in the house?  I  mean, you know, most people will say, look, in a presidential, you know,  two terms, typically, you've got even in the middle of one term you've got  that party losing seats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  History's pretty rough -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BRADY:  -- on the majority party.  On the other hand, we're delivering two  of the biggest things with this president in history.  One is a new tax  code that makes America more competitive and actually allows people to keep  more of what they earn.</p><p>And secondly, rebuilding the military in a way that keeps us safer.  And at  the end of the day, I think Americans will have a choice.  They either want  to give back more of their money to a Washington that wastes too much of it  or do they want a new economic growth that people are seeing and feeling  along Main Street.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, will voters hold the Dems to account since not one of  them voted for the tax cut plan?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Not only did no one vote for it, but they want to repeal  those taxes, not to lower the debt, for more Washington spending.  I just  think that goes against -- I haven't, Maria, met anyone in Texas who said I  really wish Washington would take more of what we earn and let's go back to  the old tax code where jobs were going overseas.  I just don't -- I haven't  heard that yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think because of the tax cut plan and its implications  on the economy triggering more growth and you think because of the  protecting of the military, this will be enough to help you hold onto the  majority in the House?  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, I think we have to continue to drive our agenda which is  still to get this economy moving.  I think trade is really important.  I  think a workforce is really important.  And on the rescissions -- doing  everything we can to not waste people's tax dollars.  I think that's an  important part of this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of the work right now and how work might change, the  training, when you say that's very important, what do you want to do?  Are  you going to be putting forth new programs in terms of training employees  for what they need to have going forward?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  You really need three things I think to solve this for the  long term.  We won't get to everything this year.  One -- a smart  immigration policy; secondly, better workforce and Virginia Fox, the  chairwoman of the Education Work Force is leading that but I also think  we've got millions of Americans, Maria, who are on the sidelines in the  welfare system government has sort of given up on.  We haven't.</p><p>We need them and want them back in the workforce.  I think you're going to  see action by the House this year to start that process, to give them some  opportunities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that. </p><p>Let me take you to Texas.  The Supreme Court is set to hear a case today  that could reshape political districts across your home state of Texas.   The case is over whether Texas congressional and state house maps were  drawn with the intent to discriminate against Hispanic and black voters.  A  decision in the case expected some time this summer.  This changes a lot  when you redistrict.  </p><p>BRADY:  It would but I don't think the underlying narrative is accurate.   Look, we're in maps that the courts themselves drew.  You know, they  decided that the legislature hadn't done an appropriate job.  They redrew  the maps to be compliant.  That's what's being challenged here.  And so I  think it's highly unusual for the Supreme Court to overturn a map that's  been drawn by, you know, an independent court in Texas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  I feel like that's what Eric Holder is  spending a lot of his time doing, looking across the country, figuring out  how to redistrict things to get more Democrats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  And you know, what's interesting in Texas is that legislature  has drawn a number of minority seats that Anglo-Democrats or others have  won themselves.  And so at the end of the day, seats are drawn to favor  minority voters.  The voters themselves will choose others for that  position.  And so I really think that the maps are secure.  They're legal.   I think they are fair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me end where I began and that's on taxes.  What kind  of growth is possible this year?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I do think we can be well above 3 percent.  I think it  really depends on ensuring that we're building off the momentum from tax  reform.  Getting trade right I think it really matters to send that signal  that we're now armed with one of the most competitive tax codes in the  world.</p><p>Give us a chance to compete in Mexico and Canada, throughout the world.  I  guarantee you Americans will win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- it's great to see you.</p><p>BRADY:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Brady joining us -- House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>Coming up, a wild scene aboard an American airlines flight after an unruly  passenger was tased with a taser gun 10 times before finally being forcibly  removed from the plane by Miami police.  That's just the beginning of the  story.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>And then from baby watch to name watch -- the world is awaiting the name of  the latest royal after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the hospital  with their third child -- a baby boy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Police in Toronto still searching for a motive in yesterday's deadly van  crash.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details on headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  Police have not  ruled out terrorism as a possible motive.  They have identified though the  suspect who drove that van -- 25-year-old Alek Minassian of Toronto.  He's  currently charged with killing 10 people and injuring 15 others.  This  incident happens while foreign ministers of the G-7 leading industrialized  nations -- Canada, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan -- were  all holding talks in Toronto.</p><p>Well, you're going to he see this -- a dramatic passenger take-down  unfolding on an American Airlines flight.  Miami police tasing a man on- board after he allegedly touched a woman inappropriately and then refused  to leave the plane.  Even other passengers were screaming for him to leave  the plane.</p><p>Jacob Garcia was arrested.  He's facing a slew of charges including  disorderly conduct.  The airline says the flight took for Chicago about an  hour late.  All remaining passengers were on that plane.</p><p>Well, we should also say this -- the CEO of United Airlines is taking now a  pay cut.  Oscar Munoz is giving up his bonus this year.  He's dropping his  compensation for 2017 to $9.6 million from $18.7 million the year before.   You're going to recall that Munoz was criticized heavily for his initial  response to a passenger being violently dragged off a plane last year and  his lack of timing of that response.  United also saying that Chairman  Robert Milton is stepping down.  The board is going to pick a new  independent chairman for the airline.  Taking a look at these stocks right  now -- both of them, American Airlines is down 10 percent so far this year,  UAL is actually up 6 percent for the year.</p><p>And then there is this, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are  leaving us waiting to hear the name of the new royal baby.  But we got  these great pictures.</p><p>Here are the top bets while we're looking.  How cute this is.  Arthur and  James are the two top bets according to the betting polls.  Mom Kate  showing off the baby -- she was wearing a red dress, which the zipping is  similar to the one that Princess Diana wore after Harry was born.  Kind of  interesting.</p><p>Another royal though seemed to have stolen the show yesterday.  Princess  Charlotte -- she's waving to the crowd as she and Prince William walked and  Prince George -- excuse Prince George -- she and Prince George walked to  meet their new baby brother.  The new prince is fifth in line to the throne  behind big sister Charlotte.  She gives a wave to the crowd.  Yes -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And Kate looks great.  I mean of course, she does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Listen, Charlotte stole the show with that little wave.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was the last wave -- the look over the shoulder, the  turn-around and kind of -- yes, it was </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She knows what she's doing.   </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She needs to work on the light bulb.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She's two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's so cute.  Well, look how cut cute she is.   Congratulations to them.  So what do you think the name is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's Arthur too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Arthur.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Charles' name -- their grandfather is Charles Philip Arthur  George, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to go with James.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got a George.  You can't name him Philip because that's  their great grandfather.  So I say Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I say too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm with you.</p><p>Coming up, a late night pivot on Capitol Hill -- a senate panel approved  the confirmation of Mike Pompeo to be the next secretary of state after  Senator Rand Paul dropped his opposition.  I'll speak with Rand Paul later  on in the program.  Join us for that.</p><p>And then who says a monkey can't sue?  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  siding with a human photographer in a copyright fight over a monkey selfie.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New this morning -- a stern warning from Iran.  The country's  leader threatening, quote, \"severe consequences for any country that  betrays the nuclear deal\".  The message comes amid French President  Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the White House.  He's expected to urge  President Trump to not withdraw from the controversial Iran deal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Fox News senior strategic  analyst General Jack Keane.  General -- good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good to see  you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you expect from the talks between the two world  leaders -- Macron and President Trump.  And I want to get your take on this  Iran deal, the deadline is what -- May 12th.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In terms of recertifying it's May 12th.  But listen here's  the framework for the disagreements that we have -- the United States has  with Europeans.  Remember President Trump, what he put in place was a  process to fix the deal versus terminate it.  And if we can't fix it, then  we will terminate it.</p><p>Now, here's what they agree on.  The Europeans and the United States agree  that we should have access to the secret site.  So that should be added to  the deal.  We agree that we should also prohibit ballistic missile testing.   So that would be added to the deal.</p><p>But here's what we fundamentally disagree on.  We are a proponent of ending  the sunset clauses which gives -- which gives the Iranians a threshold  nuclear capability 10 years from the date the deal was signed, that was  July 2015; and 15 years of pathway to actual nuclear weapons.</p><p>The European as of now will not budge over that.  So I think that will be  the point of contention and a point of discussion between President Trump  and Macron today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised that the leader of Iran comes out and says  that there will be consequences if you get out of this Iran deal?  </p><p>KEANE:  No.  That kind of rhetoric has been there forever.  They talk about  every single year destroying the state of Israel, driving the United States  out of the region.  We're the big Satan.  They always have a huge amount of  rhetoric and bluster in terms of what they're trying to do.</p><p>I mean what is surprising is that their foreign minister is in this country  Sharif -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday and giving  him a stage to create a propaganda move, you know, in terms of his position  on the nuclear deal.</p><p>Anyway -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- I think there will be substantive discussions today.  The  President is not going to budge on trying to get this deal fixed.  I'm  hoping that Pompeo gets confirmed here pretty quick -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- so he can get his head into the negotiations with the Europeans.   He may be able to achieve something that our other diplomats have not been  able to achieve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he cleared that key hurdle yesterday in the confirmation  for secretary of state making it pass the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee last night.  The Senate now expected to approve the director  after he earned the support of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>General Keane -- this is a big relief for the administration given what's  going on in the world today, from North Korea to Iran, ISIS.  We need a  secretary of state in place.  </p><p>KEANE:  There's no doubt about that.  Particularly one that is so  imminently well-qualified as Mike Pompeo.  I mean I've been around him a  few times.  He is really on top of his game and it's not surprising that  President Trump selected him for this key billet inside the administration.</p><p>I think he's the star in this administration.  And he's going to prove his  worth very quickly.  Look what he's got in front of him.  He's got the Iran  deal in front of him and he's got a summit coming up between President  Trump and the North Korean leader.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>KEANE:  So his plate -- his plate is going to be full immediately.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's not forget he just came back from North Korea.  He  actually met with Kim Jong-un already.  The White House opened up yesterday  about President Trump's highly-anticipated meeting coming up with Kim Jong- un.  Here's what was said.  Listen to this -- sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, we're not naive in this  process.  We've seen some steps in the right direction but we have a long  way to go.  We also have seen a major change in what has taken place in the  past by having our allies and partners in the region step up and do much  more than they have in the past.</p><p>China has taken a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.   They can certainly do more.  We hope they will and will continue working  with us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  South Korean President Moon Jae-in expected to meet with his  North Korean counterpart this Friday -- General.  What are you expecting?   What are you watching for in this talk over denuclearization?  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In some respects that meeting is as important as the one that  President Trump is going to have.  And here's why.  Moon is really to the  left of center and very pro-North Korean by comparison to his predecessors.   We've had leaders like him before but not quite like him.</p><p>I believe Kim Jong-un, who I think is a very shrewd negotiator and  diplomat, is doing everything he can to manipulate Moon.  I think what will  come out of this is an agreement that the Korean War is over and that the  armistice is also over.</p><p>Now what would be wonderful is that months later, those armies that are  facing each other on the border of North and South Korea pulled away.  That  would really be a positive step in the right direction.  Here's the concern  inside -- some people inside South Korea and inside pour administration. </p><p>That Moon really wants reunification as does Kim Jong-un.  And that at some  point, before all the nuclear weapons go away, Moon -- because the war is  over and we know have a treaty that they've signed will make a  recommendation that we pull the United States troops out of South Korea  which would absolutely be a huge disaster.</p><p>So, there's concern about Moon.  There's no concern about President Trump.   And I don't -- and Kim Jong-un knows his negotiations with President Trump   are going to be very tough.  He knows the president's likely going to be  very unbending on giving up the sanctions before he actually gets something  substantive in terms of denuclearization.  But the Moon - Kim Jong-un  Summit, this is worth very keeping an eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's all pretty extraordinary General, isn't it?  Wow.  Good to  see you sir.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure.  General Jack Keane joining us there.  And  coming up in the program, I'll be speaking with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  about his change of heart on Mike Pompeo later this morning.  Join us at  08:30 a.m. Eastern in about an hour, we will speak with Senator Rand Paul.  </p><p>First of all, coming up next, earnings blitz, six Dow components reporting  earnings before the bell this morning, including United Technologies, the  stock is up almost three percent.  On better than expected profit and  revenue.  We break Down those numbers next.  </p><p>Then the champagne pepper sauce.  Tobasco's new limited edition, small  batch hot sauce might cost you as much as a bottle of Bubbly.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday April 24th.   Your top stories right now, 07:30 a.m. East Coast.  Earnings in focus on  Wall Street, six Dow components reporting ahead of the open this morning.   We just heard from Caterpillar beating expectations on both, earnings and  revenue.  The industrial giants also raise its four year outlook.   Caterpillar shares are up almost four percent right now, on earnings of  $2.82 a share, revenue $12.86 billion, again both better than expected.   Stock is up.  3M is down 2.5 percent.  Coca-Cola is up, but Travelers is  down, and United Technologies is up.  We are looking at a rally in the  broader market this morning, as a result of all of this better than  expected earnings.  In fact, right here, this is the high of the morning,  up 160 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average, 2/3 of 1 percent higher.   S&amp;P is also up half a percent and the NASDAQ as well with a 32 point move  right now.  </p><p>This after a mixed day yesterday.  The Dow industrials extended the losing  streak to a fourth session in a row.  The NASDAQ was the worst performer,  it was down a quarter of a percent yesterday.  The Dow was down fraction  but still four days on the losing end.  Checking the global markets this  morning.  European indices are higher.  FT-100 is up almost half a percent,  that's 29 points higher.  CAC Quarante is flat but it's still in positive  territory with a one-point move.  And the DAX Index in Germany, up a third  of a percent, 39 points higher.  In Asia overnight stocks closed mostly  higher.  The Shanghai Composite was the best performer.  It was up just  about two percent in China.  </p><p>Big tech in focus, investors are raising concerns however about Apple.   It's a -- after all a warning of a slowdown in demand for high end  smartphones.  Morgan Stanley taking their estimates down.  We're taking a  closer look ahead of Apple's earnings report on May first.  </p><p>Cooler maker Yeti firing back at the NRA.  Despite cutting ties with the  NRA, Yeti say it fully supports the second amendment. </p><p>And no monkey business when it comes to copyright law.  A court is ruling  this monkey has no rights over its viral selfie.  It actually took a  selfie.  </p><p>OK, Tabasco going high end.  The hot sauce celebrating its 150th  anniversary with a small batch blend.  It's supposed to be good and it is  hot.  Earning split.</p><p>This morning meanwhile, Caterpillar, Jetblue, 3M, Lockheed Martin all  hitting the tape now.  Joining us now to weigh in is Morgan Creek Capital  Management chief executive officer and chief investment officer, Mark  Yusko.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on earnings so far?  We see some numbers this  morning which are pretty good.  </p><p>YUSKO:  They're pretty good.  And I think, you know, there were very lofty  expectations.  And I think that we can come closer and in some cases exceed  and that's a really good sign.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but we're watching Apple ahead of its results on May  first.  We've been talking a lot with Dan Niles from Alpha One.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Told me over the weekend and he thinks Apple's going to miss.   And then yesterday, a company -- a number of chip makers falling last week,  you know.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leading up to chip manufacturers, smartphones, Taiwan  semiconductor, predicting lower than expected sales for hand-held devices.   And then there's this we've got AMS, which is issuing a forecast echoing  the sentiment, Apple's forecast coming in below estimates, reigniting fears  that consumers are losing their appetite for hand-held devices.  What's  going on around Apple right now?  When you're --</p><p>YUSKO:  Look, I think it's a normal cyclical pause.  You know, that the way  semiconductors work is they boom and then they bust and then they boom and  then they bust.  And I think this Taiwan market really is a microcosm for  that.  You can see it just roared last year, and now it's taking a little  pause.  The component manufacturer's coming into the weaker than  expectations.  Because look, everyone's gone through the upgrade cycle.   They bought their 10.  It's OK.  It's not a world-beating phone.  So, I  think Apple will probably come in a little bit light and will have to  regroup.  But long-term the demand for hand-held is not going away.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Well, I think that what's  getting lost in this narrative is actually removing from hand-helds to in- home devices, virtual assistants, if you think about it, it's supposed to  be over 800 million units by 2020 globally.  I think that's pretty telling  you're seeing it take off in China.  So, I think one of the things when it  comes to the semiconductors is that don't they have a long way to go?  I  mean if you think about the autonomous vehicle, if you start to think about  they're used in mining operation, or digital currencies -- I mean where --</p><p>YUSKO:  Favorite thing to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know the U.S. dollar and euro are digital currencies  considering only eight percent is actually in print.  But where do you see  semiconductors going from here?  Is the cycle still going to continue to go  -- going on?  Because we see Qualcomm getting in a deal.  I mean, there's a  lot of consolidations in the space.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It's a really an important point.  The semiconductor cycle is just  getting started.  You know, today I think there are three microprocessors  per person on the planet.  There are estimates that in the next 30 years  there could be a thousand.  You know, the internet of things is really  coming sometime around 2024, there are these technological waves.  You  know, 1954 the mainframe, 1968 the microchip, 1982 the personal computer,  96 the internet, 2010 the mobile net, 2024 the internet of things, the  internet of value, cryptocurrencies, secure ties, tokens, all of these  things demand semiconductors.  So, I think you make a really good point.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KINGS COLLEGE:  But  Mark, you know, this internet of things, these home devices, I mean they  rely very heavily on the use of data, slicing data.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  What do we know about you -- how do we customize your  experience.  We're seeing a sort of ground swell change in that.  Does that  affect the long-term picture on these kind of devices?  Where in a world  where we assumed, hey, use data however you want, we don't live in that  world anymore.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It absolutely affects how we're going to use that data.  And the  great thing about blockchain technology is it inverts the ownership of the  data.  If you think about internet protocol, Tim Berners-Lee, not a really  wealthy guy, we use TCP/IP every single day.  But the app developers got  all the benefit because we all -- I don't a Facebook account.  But  everybody puts their data out there and Mark and his guys get rich.   Blockchain flips that upside down and the protocol layer can own the value.   So, if you think about what's going to happen, is we're going to have our  data that we use -- I was on a show yesterday with a guy on Shopin, that  they have your profile.  When you go to a site, not only does it fill in  all the data, so you don't have to fill it in and remember your credit card  number, but then it extracts some of the ad revenue back to your account,  paid in crypto.  Awesome idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Let me -- let me ask you, because when we're talking  about these chip companies, Intel and Qualcomm and AMD are reporting this  week.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see the same upset there that we're seeing that  -- with the anticipation about Apple?  </p><p>YUSKO:  You know, I think we might.  You know, one of the things that  people got ahead of themselves in some of the estimates on the chip makers,  particularly AMD and Nvidia because a lot of them were being used for  mining.  For Bitcoin mining and the theory mining and that did take a  little bit of a dip in the first quarter when prices went down.  Now we're  seeing a recovery in those prices, so I think that will be better for  second quarter.  But you think first quarter could be light.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are raising capital right now for a move into crypto with  security tokens.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, so if you think about the three areas, the Jeff's focused on.   There's cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, things that are store value or  eventually going to be a payment system, they're utility tokens, that's all  the craze about ICO's where you actually don't own the company, you own  some utility function -- like this data for Shopin.  Or then there are  security tokens.  If you think of everything of value, this building we're  sitting in, a house or the plaza hotel, everything can be tokenized and we  go from the age of paper ownership, physical securities, to digital owners  -- to electronic ownership, blips on a screen to true digital ownership.   And that trend is massive.  And every year, 14 trillion, with a t, trillion  dollars of real goods transfer ownership.  And that's all going to be  digitized.  So, we want to raise funds to invest or help institutional  investors invest in the security tokens.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Where are you on that?  How much have you raised?  </p><p>YUSKO:  We just announced -- we just announced -- we acquired a team and  we're going to go out, start raising that fund here in the next little bit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are you going to -- are you going to buy bitcoin or are you  going to buy token?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, not crypto, tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>YUSKO:  So, not crypto.  Not utility tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  You've got a big educational job ahead of you I think, to help  people understand --</p><p>YUSKO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- the difference and why -- I mean, this world of privacy  concerns.  This could be a real answer, but people have to get it, right?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, look, cryptocurrency I really do think is the future of money,  so the internet of money.  And if you think about what voice over I.P. or  the internet did for information and commerce, right.  We transfer  everything over internet protocol, this is just transferring money over  internet protocol.  If I want to give you money, I don't need a trusted  third party.  I don't need a bank to tell that we did that.  Once it's on  the chain, it's immutable, it's permanent.  We can do that.  Not good news  for banks.  That's why the banks hate blockchain and bitcoin.  But then you  think about utility tokens, there's a very interesting business there about  having a social network, have a coin that we can use for rewarding you, for  adding data to a social network but security tokens is the big opportunity.   That is true digital ownership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You play -- you still like stocks here or no?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last time you were pretty cautious.  You were saying maybe you  want to sell into some of this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, we were cautious.  And what you've seen since January 26th --  we talked about this, this is distribution.  Every day the last half hour,  the institutional money was selling and selling hard into the close.  And  we've been going down really since January.  The last two days,  interesting, Friday and yesterday, the last half hour there was some  buying.  So I'm cautiously optimistic that maybe the distribution selling  is over and if earnings do come in higher than expected, we could maybe see  a little rally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch that.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks for having me, always fun to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Mark Yusko there.</p><p>Coming up, monkey see, monkey sue.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now this, Yeti is defending its second amendment stance after  an NRA e-mail.  Cheryl Casone with the details now with headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, you know Yeti that make  those coolers -- those drink coolers.  Well their commonly NRA's claim in  accurate.  After an NRA lobbyist sent an e-mail that the company has ceased  doing business with the NRA station.  So, the cooler maker has issued a  statement saying in part \"We were eliminating a group of outdated  discounting programs when we notified the NRA Foundation and the other  organizations about this change.  Yeti explained that we were offeing them  an alternative customization program broadly available to several consumers  and other organization.  So, we'll think about back and forth with those  two.</p><p>Well, an appeals court put an end to the monkey business over this monkey's  selfie.  It's famous.  It was taken back in 2011.  But a legal battle  ensued over if animals can own copyrights.  PETA argued in court that all  profits the photograph makes should belong to Naruto the monkey, since he  held the camera and he did snapped the photo.  Unfortunately for Naruto, he  won't be going on any banana shopping sprees.  The judges upheld the lower  court ruling in favor of yes, the photographer.  Only humans can file  copyright suits.  There you go.</p><p>And (INAUDIBLE), Tabasco is celebrating 150 years in business.  And they've  got a new sauce.  McIlhenny which makes Tabasco is releasing a limited- edition diamond reserve pepper sauce, it comes in a champagne style bottle.   The price is kind of champagne-isk, I guess, $35 for 6-ounces.  Supplies  are limited.  Or maybe a nice bottle of Prosecco .  I can't decide.  I'm  back and forth on this one.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a lot of money for Tabasco, I sort of like it.  </p><p>KELLY:  You like Prosecco, get some Tobasco.  You can have it all Cheryl.   You don't need to choose one or the other.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Can you eat Tabasco?  Out of a bottle that looks like champagne?  </p><p>KELLY:  No, you pour it on.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I know.  But like, it doesn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  it better be good.  </p><p>BRENERG:  I will.  I'm going to get that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am going to get it.  Because they look good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should -- maybe Hillary  Clinton can weigh in.  She's kind of the hot sauce lady.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She carries hot sauce in her purse.  Maybe she can tell us if  it's good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  All right, well take a break.  When we come back,  an American success story, how two brothers turned their Connecticut based  clothing company into a big business.  I'll talk to the founders of  Vineyard Vines coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, at a time that retailers are struggling,  one clothing brand is growing like a vine.  The Connecticut based Vineyard  Vines started in 1998 by two brothers selling ties, now has 95 stores  across the nation.  The brand is also sold in stores like Nordstrom and  Bloomingdales.  Joining me right now are Shep Murray, Vineyard Vines co- founder and CEO and Ian Murray, Vineyard Vines co-founder and CEO.  Good to  see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SHEP MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Thanks, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've been following the company for a lot of years.  And  I've seen how you've grown it.  Talk to us about how you started this and  why you left your desk jobs to go into retail like this?</p><p>S. MURRAY:  Well go.  </p><p>IAN MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Well, sure.  We were  working down the street in Manhattan and we didn't like our jobs.  We were  young.  I was 23, Shep was 27.  And we decided that we could make neckties  to sell to everyone who goes to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket for the  weekend and it comes back to the floor for the stock exchange.  And once  the -- they can't wear t-shirts.  So, they wear the ones that represents  Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How tough was it?  I mean to really -- you had an idea but you  had to put it into practice.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  Yes, I think the idea was to bring the good life to work with  you and in a time when casual workplace was at its height, everyone was  wearing black mock turtlenecks and all that sort of stuffs, the idea was to  bring the good life to work and kind of our company mantra, is every day  should feel this good.  And so, you know, right now, it's all about make  America great again.  We wanted to make clothing fun again.  And so, that's  what we did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I love the symbol of the whale.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  It's pretty fun.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  We grew up, our father actually carved wooden whales over our  doors.  So, that's how we got our logo.  And our customer early on was a  guy who wore Nantucket red shorts and a faded blue polo shirt.  So, that's  how we get the pink and blue color.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I love it.  But I mean, you had to actually get the  funding.  You had to get access to credit.  How easy or tough was that in  terms of creating this business?  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  I mean, well what happened was we had this idea and we were --  I have spent a couple years working on the New York stock exchange.  We  were big followers of you in your past job and Ian was working at a P.R.  Agency.  Then, I went to work for Madison Avenue.  And we were like, we  didn't want our bosses job.  And so, we had nothing to lose by going out on  our own and starting this.  So, 20 years later with a credit card cash  advance of $8,000, we have all these stores and an amazing, amazing team  who help us live every day should feel this good and we still own 100  percent of the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  So, we're celebrating 20 years now.  But we just wrote credit  card checks to ourselves.  We totaled about $7,000 or $8,000.  We bought a  couple hundred ties that we figured out how to make.  And we sold them, we  kept reinvesting the profits in the business and here we are 20 years  later.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's it's incredible.  That is an incredible sport.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, it's crazy.  It's the American dream.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- I mean, it really is the American dream.  But I  mean, in terms of the access to credit, you didn't need it.  You just --  you did it yourself.  You're getting advances on the credit card.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, and over the years, we've been working with a number of  different banks.  We've worked with JP Morgan our lead bank and they've  been fantastic and helping us grow.  And giving us some resources, but we  still have all the equity.  And we've got a little over 100 stores now  throughout the country.  And we work with all sorts of great organizations  that we never thought we'd have the opportunity to work with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the -- is th next move to take it public?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  I don't know about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about an Amazon economy?  Tell me about that.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you've got companies and stores going out of business  left and right because of the Amazon that's going on.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  One of the beauties about being privately held, is we're able  to put the gas on and off when we want.  Amazon is amazing.  We're huge  fans of what Jeff has done.  And you know, we're big Amazon customers.   What we want to do and what we think our customer is looking for is a  better experience.  Amazon's a great marketplace.  But when you go into our  stores and you meet our customers and you get to touch and feel the product  and you see the packaging we provide and all of the other cool lifestyle  stuff that we do, we believe that there's a place for Amazon and brands.   And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, the packaging is a big deal.  How do you grow it  from here?  I mean, you've got these ties that you brought in to show off.   But I see we have a whole rack of dresses and -- I mean, what's the next  step in terms of growth?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.  I mean, I think one of the things we're really having a  lot of fun with is joining our customers, the community that follow  Vineyard Vines with other passions in their life.  We're really excited, we  just announced that we're going to be the official style of the Boston Red  Sox and Fenway Park.  But we're also the official style of the Kentucky  Derby, the America's Cup, we launched a partnership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic, getting into sports.  I love it.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  We just do kind of fun things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Ian, Shep.  Shep, Ian, great to see you both.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  All right, thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations.  Vineyard Vines.

Thank you so much and happy Tuesday everybody.  Good  morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A Blue Chip earnings blitz, six Dow components all due out before the  opening bell this morning including Coca Cola, Verizon, Caterpillar among  others.  Futures this morning looking good, indicating a higher opening for  the broader averages this morning.  We're expecting the Dow Industrials to  be up about 100 points right out of the gate, NASDAQ to be up about 34  points right after the gate this morning.  We are covering the earnings  blitz.</p><p>Alphabet meeting expectations on both profit and revenue last night.   Shares of Google's parent company up three percent in after hours trading  but a spike in expenses temper the initial excitement.  The stock is up  two-thirds of a percent.  Also talking about the company raising its value  in its stake in Uber, that also made the earnings look better than  expected.  Dan Niles predicted what would happen and he was right no  expenses, we're going to talk more about that.  </p><p>Markets closing mostly lower yesterday meanwhile, weighed down by rising  bond yields.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials down 14 points, the S&amp;P was  up a fraction and the NASDAQ down 17.  The Dow down for a fourth session in  a row, that is the longest losing streak since March. </p><p>In Europe this morning, indices look like this, FT-100 is up a third of a  percent, that's 22 points higher.  CAC Quarante is down just a fraction and  the DAX in Germany up 38 points, that is one-third of one percent.  In Asia  overnight, stock closed mostly higher, Shanghai Composite the top performer  up nearly two percent.  </p><p>And then an open book (INAUDIBLE) for the first time, Facebook is revealing  its secret rules for user posts.  Where the company says it crosses the  line.</p><p>Then the Uber of China steps on the gas, the Chinese ride hailing giant  reportedly in talks to go public.  The jaw-dropping valuation for this  company.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney gets jazzed up, the senate hopeful making a scene at  Utah's game against the Thunder.  His hilarious taunt against OKC  Superstar, Russell Westbrook.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The King's College  Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  And Benchmark Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of earnings to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean, this earning season is a pivotal one especially  because everything is really kind of baked in, everybody expects 18 percent  rise on earnings, they expect revenues to be up five percent.  One of the  telling things about earnings season is every sector is suppose to grow and  that hasn't happened since 2014.  So, come to (INAUDIBLE) week of earning  season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure.  Well, I think it's important.  I want to point out  this company AMS, reporting first quarter results.  Now they were OK, the  numbers but the real key here is one of the lines in the press release  says, \"We are seeing a slowdown in sales of smartphones, high-end  smartphones,\" that means AKA Apple.</p><p>So, again, this is -- we're looking at potential slowdown in Apple as Dan  Niles who joined me this weekend on Wall Street said to expect a miss on  Apple.  I wanted to just check AMS because all of the Apple suppliers are  involved in this story and you really see what's to come in terms of the  Apple quarter.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  This is -- I mean, this is so interesting to think this  wave that Apple's been writing for such a long time looks like it's coming  to an end.  This is a company that investors have counted on quarter after  quarter to deliver and now you're looking at their core business, not just  faltering domestically by the way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- this is a global story right now (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  The X10 is not -- just not living up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well people don't want to spend money on it and that's why they  came over to SC editions, you guys remember that?  It was a lower priced  model, they already hit peak sort of luxury sales a couple years ago and  they were always trying to figure out a way how do they get -- get that net  marginal buyer.</p><p>They didn't want to compromise margins, that's something Apple never wants  to do, they want to keep them around 40 percent on the gross margin side.   So, neither they've got to compromise on margins or they've got to  compromised on pricing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned Dan Niles, we said this before the show even  started, Dan Niles got Alphabet, Google right as well in terms of the  expenditures.  There are a lot of -- you see the -- if you look at the  stock this morning for Google, I'm just going to call it Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the symbol is still Goo -- it's still Google.  But,  again, the concern there that will hold back this stock is what are the  regulations going to be on this business?  They don't want to tout their ad  revenue growth a little too much.  By the way, it was up 24 percent, $26.6  billion, that's almost double what Facebook is believed to have generated  an ad revenue for the same period.  </p><p>But they're not going to champion it because, again, there are a lot of  questions that we talk about on his show yesterday of how much of their  data are they abusing?  And how far are they going and continue to generate  this ad revenue?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big story.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big story.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, it's so interesting to watch it because the numbers here  were good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, overall they were very good and yet the market reaction  was, \"Uh, we don't know about the future.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They increased the valuation though of their ownership's stake  in Uber and that also made the numbers look stronger again.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But even backing that out is a good result, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The second quarter I should say.  But the expenses are an  issue, there are some news in there.  So we've got a big show this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman, Texas Congressman Kevin Brady in the studio this  morning.  Foreign Relations Committee Member, Kentucky Senator, Rand Paul  is with us after changing his vote last night and voting for Mike Pompeo.   Former Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee is with us along with former  Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter.  </p><p>Former Hillary Clinton Director of Strategic Communications and Elrod  Strategist President, Adrienne Elrod is here.  And FOX News Senior  Strategic Analyst, Retired General, Four Star General, Jack Keane.  Don't  miss a moment of it, we got a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with a look at Futures, we are expecting a  higher opening for the broader averages.  We're looking at a rally at the  start of trading.  Investors are waiting first quarter results from six Dow  components this morning and if noted a moment ago, we are looking at  overall S&amp;P500 growth in profit of about 19 percent for the first quarter.   That is the estimate.</p><p>United Technologies, Coca Cola, Travelers, Verizon, Caterpillar, and 3M all  reporting before the opening of trading this morning Brian.  This is going  to be a big day.  Obviously, that's going to weigh on markets or influence  markets.  Right now, we're expecting a rally f a hundred.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well -- I mean, it should and it's good to see the market up.  I  mean these numbers have been extraordinarily this quarter.  These are --  what we're talking about decades since we've seen this kind of beat  numbers, companies reported as well and yet markets have been back and  forth.</p><p>It's good to see them up a hundred year because the fundamentals  underlying, those are good.  The problem this week is tech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Tech is such a question mark and I think that's going to rattle  investors just a little bit.  To Dagen's point, because we don't know this  Alphabet question, what's happening in the future without these  regulations?</p><p>KELLY:  Well they do.  Yes, you know the question in a month from now, the  European regulators are going to come in and they're going to implement  their protection rules and it's, what are the U.S. regulators going to do  behind it?  Google --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Google had said we're -- we've been -- 18 months we've been  reading.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they've been doing it for 18 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they beat the numbers, the technology giant, Google's parent  Alphabet, they beat the numbers yesterday, they reported earnings of $13.33  a share on revenue of $31.5 billion in revenue.</p><p>Here's what Alpha One Capital Partners Dan Niles accurately predicted would  be the big issue ahead of this report.  Listen to this, hear what he's  saying last week on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  The problem with  Google is the exact opposite as with Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided  expenses up 45 to 60 percent this year before this data breach stuff ever  happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't (INAUDIBLE) but Wall Street has expenses  modeled so that -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I  think the expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  There you go.  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been -- let me -- so they spent a record $7.3 billion in  the first-quarter, nearly triple what the company spent a year ago, triple.   Now some of that, almost $2.5 billion of that was buying the Chelsea Market  here in New York City but they added 5,000 employees including 2,000 that's  -- that came from the purchase of HTC's mobile, a handset design operation.</p><p>But, again, it -- if this is going to be a headwind for the company,  regulation, how much more ad revenue can they continue to squeeze out of  people now who are concerned about their privacy and the expenditure.</p><p>KELLY:  Well just real quick on what Dan is saying, Dan hit the nail on the  head and one of the reasons you can tell is because traffic acquisition  cost were up 36 percent and last quarter, Google actually said it was going  to be down.  </p><p>So that's why the stock sold off initially when they released earnings.   And now it's up in the premarket because the Asian markets are up.  So it's  not actually off of their own earnings --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>KELLY:  -- it's because general market sentiment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, the stock wasn't even up this year.  It was up  barely two percent.  It was trading in a pretty reasonable valuation for  tech.</p><p>KELLY:  Well one of the reasons why they spent so much money on that  Chelsea Market, over $2 billion is because their biggest competitor in the  advertising space, Amazon bought another building in midtown and they're  going to be leading the way in the advertising revolution, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well look, I mean the stock is obviously going to be big  volume today as well.  Then there's Facebook opening up about the secret  guidelines today on how they actually police content while introducing a  new appeals process for users who are found in violation of Facebook's  \"standards.\"  </p><p>The Silicon Valley titan is also revealing and increase the number of  content reviewers by 40 percent year-over-year, Dagen, what do you think  about this one?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could sum up some of their policies in a couple sentences, if  you're prolife and pro second amendment, your content gets banned on  Facebook.  I've had friends that experience that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is horrible.  That is exactly the things that Congress is  zeroing in on.  You cannot control what the rest of us see and what we  don't see and that's what some of these companies are doing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they're about community, whether they're about building a  community as long as you agree with what the people running the company  believe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not right.

So this includes the IR15 that was used in the Waffle House  shooting, separate gun, separate incident.  But remember, the shooting  rampage was eventually stopped by hero customer James Shaw, Jr.  </p><p>He appeared on Fox and Friends first this morning.  Not only is Shaw a  hero, he started a Go Fund Me page to raise money for the victim's  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  I just want to give them a small  gesture.

TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS -- road we're in and need a strong Secretary of  State in place and so the democrats don't play politics with national  security appointments but instead confirm Mike Pompeo to this position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz with me yesterday  throwing his support behind President Trump's nominee for Secretary of  State, Mike Pompeo in an interview on Fox News about 4:00 yesterday.</p><p>Pompeo advanced yesterday with a favorable recommendation from the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee after republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  changed his mind and his vote.  Joining us now and talk more about that is  former Presidential Candidate himself, former republican Arkansas Governor,  Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you sir.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.   Great to be with you today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised with what took place last night?  Basically  Rand Paul saying, \"Look, I had a conversation with the president, I believe  now that Mike Pompeo agrees with the president and with me to lessen the  entitlement across the world, what's your take?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well a couple of things, first of all, Rand Paul is a principle  guy, there were some things he was uncomfortable with until he come around.   The second thing about it is when he's on your show later today.  Notice  that he is -- his arm is in a cast, Donald Trump broke it twisting  yesterday.</p><p>But the point is Mike Pompeo is going to be confirmed as Secretary of  State.  He should have made this just sliding through this is an absurdity.   If the democrats want to pick some fights, this was a dumb on the pick.   Take a look at after somebody who has his pedigree, his experience, and  frankly already having sat down with North Korea and stands in a position  to do some extraordinary things.  They shouldn't fight everything because  then nothing they do has any credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's not forget what he just did, he just went all the  way to North Korea and met with Kim Jong-un.  It's a good point and I'm  glad you brought it up, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out,  they call out Jeff Merkley, the democrat from Oregon saying that a vote for  Mike Pompeo is a vote for Trump's war cabinet.</p><p>Well guess what, Mike Pompeo is nominated to be the chief diplomat.  So  what -- how do you fight potential war with diplomacy?  So I think that  some of these senators need to go back to school a little bit on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was a very important symbolic moment for the republicans.   You did not want to be where the republicans still in control of the  Senate, the republicans having the majority on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, 11 to 10 to be the first time since at least 1925 that the  Secretary of State nominee didn't get a favorable vote coming out of the  Senate Foreign Relations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would have been a slap in the face of American people who  voted for these republican senators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially with what's going on right now.  You know  Governor, my favorite line from Lindsey Graham yesterday was, \"You might be  sick of fighting with these extremists but guess what, they're not tired of  fighting with you.\"  And so this is the reality that we face.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Lindsey Graham said yesterday.  Another is, \"We've  got to keep this up and we've got to keep the troops in Syria over the  near-term because they're not tired of fighting with us.\"</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There are a lot of republicans who are not that fund of Donald  Trump and I get that but they've got to remember that under the  constitution, when he's elected president, he has every right to pick his  own cabinet and staff.  And unless they can find something morally  objectionable or outrageously unacceptable, they should give the president  the people that he wants to be in his cabinet.</p><p>The republicans did that for John Kerry, for Hillary Clinton, I doubt that  a lot of who voted 94 by the way votes in the Senate on both Kerry and  Clinton, I'm sure there were a lot of republicans who held their nose and  did it.  But they looked at the constitution and they said, \"Whether we  like it or not, Obama's president, he has a right to pick his Secretary of  State.\"  I just don't understand who these democrats look into a camera  which they love to do but look into a camera and explain, \"Oh Mike Pompeo,  I can't vote for him because he has views about same sex marriage or maybe  views about abortion\" which has nothing to do with being Secretary of  State.  That's an absurdity and I think they had embarrassed themselves.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are three democrat senators who come out and said that  they will vote in favor of Mike Pompeo to be the Secretary of State.  And  correct me if I'm wrong, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Mansion in West Virginia, and  then Joe Donnelly, so those are the three so far.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's correct.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But Governor, you do have at least four who voted to confirm him  as director of CIA who said they will not vote for him for this position.   And I think you hit it exactly right, they're talking about issues that  have nothing to do with foreign policy, the job of a Secretary of State.   How do you defend the critique of Pompeo on those grounds when that had  nothing to do with his job?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, again, it's just a stretch.  They don't have anything, so  they make something up.  They'd be better off bringing James Taylor into  the Senate Chamber and let him sing, \"You've Got a Friend\" and I'll have a  big bear hug. </p><p>That would make a lot more sense in what they're doing.  I think they're  hurting themselves for the midterms but as somebody who hopes republicans  hangs on to both Houses, I can only hope that they continue to act this  foolishly when it comes to the president's appointments especially in light  of the fact that he's got this extraordinary relationship with the  president of France whose got North Korea coming to the table.  Those are  some pretty big things happening right now on the national security front.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, really big things actually.  Well let me turn to border  security Governor, a caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants  arriving at the U.S. border, the pictures are incredible.</p><p>President Trump tweeted on the matter yesterday, here's what he wrote,  \"Despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border  being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland  Security not to let these large caravans of people into our country.  It is  a disgrace.  We are the only country in the world so na[ve.  Wall.\"</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen issued a statement reinforcing  U.S. immigration law.  She said, \"If you enter the United States illegally,  let me be clear, you have broken the law and we will enforce the law  through prosecution of illegal border crosser.\"  Governor, your take on  this.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's no doubt that one of the reasons, one of the big reasons  Donald Trump is sitting in the White House today is because of his position  on immigration.  It's not that Americans are anti-immigrant but their --  but what they are is they're anti-breaking the law and getting away with it  and they're tired of it.</p><p>And what they want is if there are people who legitimately need asylum,  Americans have big hearts, they're -- they understand but they're not  willing to just open the gates and say, \"Come on in everybody, we've got  benefits including welfare and medical care\" that's just not where this  country is right now and it frankly shouldn't be.  We have no idea who the  people are in those caravans, so they've got to be vetted, they've got to  be carefully screened and that's what president is asking for but it's got  the American people demand.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Governor, do you think we'll get anything done when it comes  to immigration policy this year, vis-a-vis DACA or any other plans?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We could if the democrats really believed in it but they don't  and they've shown they don't.  The president laid more on the table than I  ever thought h would lay on the table more than any republican ever wanted  to lay on the table.  </p><p>But he did it basically I think to say, \"We're not against immigration  reform, we're just wanting to do it in a context of law.\"  Now the  democrats walked away from going this point of saying, \"This is the most  important thing we have to deal with and the deadline is looming to, \"Oh,  never mind.\"  I'm just amazed that they can do this with such a (INAUDIBLE)  just indifference to the causes they claimed to champion, they really don't  stand for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Governor, good to see you  sir, thanks so much for weighing in.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Good to talk to you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee joining us there.  We'll take a break.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th, your  top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are looking to  rebound, take a look, Futures indicating a rally right at the start of  trading, up 140 points on the Dow, 15 on S&amp;P, and 48 points higher on the  NASDAQ, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Driving the sentiment earnings, once again, it is the busiest week for  earnings season, this week.  Today, alone, six Dow Components will report  their first-quarter.  Among the names to watch, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and  Verizon, may very well mean market movers.  This after a mixed day  yesterday, the Dow extended its losing streak to a fourth session.  The  technology heavy, NASDAQ, the worst performer, down a quarter of a percent  yesterday, 17 points lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check the action in Europe, FT-100 is up 25, a  third of a percent, CAC Quarante is flat on the session in Paris, and the  DAX Index in Germany, up one third of a percent, 50 points higher.

Listen, I think it's very troubling that Bob  Mueller has appointed a number of lawyers to his team, who are partisan  Democrats who repeatedly have been Democratic donors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of that criticism and the latest on the probe, coming up  this morning.  Plus, another Chinese giants looking to make its way on Wall  Street, the Wall Street Journal reporting the country's top rival to Uber,  is eyeing an IPO with an eye-popping valuation.

We've got the details on the  impact.  </p><p>And then, Mitt Romney, from senate candidate to top Hitler, his talks  against Russell Westbrook, going viral, all that, coming up this Tuesday  morning but first, lawmakers are speaking out this morning over the Special  Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.  Yesterday, Senator Ted Cruz  outlined his concerns about the investigation, when I spoke with him on Fox  News, in the afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRUZ:  The Department of Justice, the Special Counsel, should not become a  partisan fishing expedition.  Listen, I think it's very troubling that Bob  Mueller has appointed a number of lawyers to his team, who are partisan  Democrats, who repeatedly been Democratic donors.  In my view, the  Department of Justice and the FBI, that they should be beyond reproach,  they have a long bipartisan tradition of staying out of politics and when  you see partisan text back and forth, when you see partisan Democratic  donors in a grill in the investigation, that rises very serious questions  about fairness and impartiality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the Former Director of Strategic  Communications for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and President of  Elrod Strategies, Adrienne Elrod, along with Former Special Assistant to  President Trump and Former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc  Lotter.  Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Good  morning.</p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, PRESIDENT, ELROD STRATEGIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, let me ask you, what do you think of when you -- what  do you say when you hear all about this bias at the top of the FBI, the  bias at the top of the Department of Justice during the presidential  election where they were very favorable toward Hillary Clinton and,  basically, created this narrative against Donald Trump.  What's your take  on it?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I won't exactly say that they were favorable toward Hillary  Clinton because I strongly believe it.  Comey, reopening the investigation  12 days before the campaign is why we lost, the primary reason why we lost.   But, look, I think these comments by Senator Cruz are disturbing and yet  another example of Republicans trying to undermine the credibility of  Robert Mueller in the investigation.  That's exactly why we need this  bipartisan bill that Democrats and Republicans are pushing in congress,  allowed to come to the floor, so that Bob Mueller will be protected from  being fired by Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, but, Adrienne, actually, when you look at what took  place, Jim Comey wrote an exoneration letter for Hillary Clinton even  before he did the interview.  When she did the interview with the FBI, it  wasn't recorded, it wasn't on the record, we saw all the texts from Peter  Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page, where they wanted an insurance policy  and now we know from the Chairman of the Intel Committee that, in fact,  there was no official intelligence used to launch an attack on Donald Trump  and an investigation on Donald Trump  So to me, it looks like the collusion  was with Hillary Clinton and the FBI, actually.</p><p>ELROD:  No.  I completely and respectfully disagree, Maria.  Let's also  remember that Strzok and Page were both immediately removed from this  committee when --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they still work there.  They actually still work at the FBI  and they have security clearances, still.  They still are there.</p><p>ELROD:  By the Special Counsel.  They were removed from being a part of the  investigation and the Special Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc Lotter, how do you see it?</p><p>LOTTER:  I agree with you, Maria, I mean, there are some very disturbing  things that have taken place by a very small handful of people at the top  of the FBI and the Justice Department and the former administration, but  those things are being looked at right now by the inspector general.   There's been a criminal referral possibly involving former Deputy Director  of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, for the way he was conducting himself during  that time period.  </p><p>So, there are very serious concerns.  But once again, the White House has  said over and over and over again, including yesterday.  There has been no  discussion about firing Director Mueller and that's why Senator McConnell  is saying that this bill that protects him is just nothing more than a  political sham like their lawsuit from the Democratic National Committee,  just trying to keep the Russian narrative alive when there is absolutely no  there, there.</p><p>KELLY:  Hey, Adrienne, it's Kevin Kelly, one of the questions I have is do  you think Democrats are going to, sort of, keep this narrative up through  the election and then hopefully, when the 2018 elections are over, everyone  will, sort of, move on and hopefully, Mueller will, kind of, wind down his  investigation or do you see it ramping up and then dogging the Trump  presidency for the remaining few years?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I think the Democrats, look, going into 2018 and beyond, I  mean, it's kind of irrelevant from the actual midterm.  Doing everything we  can to protect the Mueller investigation.  It is incredibly important that  Robert Mueller be able to carry on his investigation with integrity,  without any, sort of, undue influence from the administration.  I think  that's what we're focused on doing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is a -- that is a bill  or a cockamamie idea cooked up because people hate Trump, about this bill  to prevent him from furrowing Bob Mueller.  In fact, if you look at it,  it's unconstitutional.  It takes the power of the executive branch and  tries to hand it to somebody else or another part of the government.   Antonin Scalia will be screaming to the high heavens where he is right now,  if he was still on planet earth about this.  And that is why Mitch  McConnell has said he's not -- he' not going to touch it, essentially, that  he is not going to bring the bill up for a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, you got two GOP chairman striking a deal with the  Department of Justice for documents tied to the FBI investigation and to  Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.  The joint statement from  Congressman Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy, reads in part this, we look  forward to reviewing the information to better understand the decisions  made by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017.  Congress has a  constitutional responsibility to preserve the integrity of our justice  system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken.   Adrienne, how do you see that?</p><p>ELROD:  I mean, I see this is -- you know, why are we spending time on this  anymore, I mean, the case closed situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's obstruction, because it's obstruction of justice.</p><p>ELROD:  It was closed -- it was closed before the campaign, it was closed  before the midterms.  You know, look, if Goodlatte and Gowdy want to focus  their time on this, fine.  But I frankly think it is a waste of their time.   I think it's a waste of taxpayer dollars and I think it's a waste of the  Department of Justice's time to produce these documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let me ask you this, I mean, were you there when the DNC  got hacked?</p><p>ELROD:  I was.  I was on Hillary Clinton's campaign when this happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what was the answer for her not giving the servers to the  FBI?  Why would she not give the server?  I mean, you're the DNC, you get  hacked, all your e-mails are out there in the public view.  Why wouldn't  you want the strength and the power and the might of the FBI to figure out  exactly who hacked you and what went on?  Why not give up servers?  And why  hire private company so that the servers are kept away from the FBI? </p><p>ELROD:  Well, look, I think, she has a lot of reasons for not turning over  the servers to the FBI --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the reason?</p><p>ELROD:  She produced all the e-mails that were asked and those e-mails were  investigated and it was determined by the FBI, and by the Department of  Justice to Hillary Clinton, I did not do anything wrong and she apologized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>ELROD:  But again -- but again, this was in -- this was in 2016, case  closed.  I think there's another way for Republicans to continue to try to  distract from the problems that they are facing at the party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, actually, it was the Democrats that are distracted,  Adrienne, let's be clear.  They didn't give up the server after they were  hacked, and instead, they brought in a private company to investigate the  server rather than giving it to the FBI.  That's where the obstruction lies  right now and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier along with the DNC which  was used to wiretap a member of Donald Trump's team.  That, we know for a  fact, Adrienne.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, we also admit there's a lot of information on the dossier  that has been independently corroborated by the FBI and the Special  Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Actually, it's unverified.  This was all unverified in the  dossier.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, again, let's let the Mueller investigation play out.  Let's  let it play out, Maria, let's let it play out.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Marc, if you want the Mueller investigation to play out,  shouldn't you also want this investigation to play out?  I mean, why so  much concern about one happening and the other closing up quickly, don't we  need both?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I mean, it's typical, I mean, Democrats want a double  standard, they don't want to go back and look at the things they did with  their collusion with the fact that, Loretta Lynch, according to Jim Comey's  book, may have been compromised and that's why he took the steps that he  took in the -- in the entire situation.  There's a lot of information that  needs to be uncovered here, and, I think, that's where we're going to see  congress continue to look into it.  </p><p>The Inspector General is still looking into the actions that took place at  the FBI, at the Department of Justice.  And we just need to get all of this  information out in public and get it behind us.  We've got too many good  things going on in this country from an economic standpoint, to the way of  our standing on the world stage over the leadership of President Trump.  We  don't need to be going back and always rehashing this.  Let's talk about  the great things that are happening right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is this agreement that Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte  have engineered with the Justice Department, Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, it sounds to me that they're going to go back and get a lot  of the documents that have not been turned over yet, as it may relate to  communications and other documents during that time period.  And so, since  they are investigatory documents, sometimes, obviously, there are some  issues there, there may be some classifications, but it's great that  they're -- that they're working with the Department of Justice.  We're  going to put the politics behind us on this.  And let's just get the  information out there, let the American people decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Adrienne Elrod, Marc  Lotter, good to see you both.  Thank you very much --</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>ELROD:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  for weighing in on all of this.  By the way, the President has  said (INAUDIBLE) he's not going to fire Robert Mueller.  So I don't know  why, you know, this question keeps coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the, media, every time that he is near a microphone,  people are shouting the question at him, are you going to fire Bob Mueller?   Are you going to fire Bob Mueller?  So this is an idea, looking at it from  my perspective, they are goading him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It says if members of the media are goading him to fire Bob  Mueller.  And it's -- you know what it had?  It's a narrative that's  basically concocted by people --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Muddy the waters.  Keep money in the waters.

If  this company went public, DiDi would beat rival Uber to the public markets.  </p><p>Privacy concerns hitting Match.com users after a glitch re-activated some  old accounts.  And while the company maintained, it was a limited number of  accounts, their current privacy statements says that the company can retain  certain information associated with your account even after you close it,  even if you get married, have children, there you go.

A lot of strong opinion on set  that day.  Two million votes came in and the winner is lemon glaze.  Lemon  beat out blueberry, caramel, and maple.  I know -- I wanted maple.  The new  donut goes on sale today; only for a week -- whatever, Krispy Kreme.  It's  only available through Sunday.  I forgot who wanted lemon.  I was voting  for maple, but there was a lot of back and forth on that one.    BARTIROMO:  You wanted lemon.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Lemon is the rightful winner here.  There's nothing better on a  donut than lemon glaze.  </p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Way better than maple.</p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon, talk about Uber, they can't even get their IPO  out, their valuations gone to $46 billion.  The Chinese company, they had  to cede control too in China.  Now, valued at 80 billion, can you believe  it?  That's a lemon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will Uber ever go public.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes, yes.  Their CEO has re-affirmed that they are going to go  public in 2019.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got my head on my hands because some the mornings, you just  want to talk about donuts, Kevin.  Some morning --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All business all the time.  That's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, he's our younger brother.  And I just have to  bust your job.  I can't help it.  You're my younger brother too.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  The donut eating and talking younger brother.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You understand the importance of talking about it?</p><p>BRENBERG:  Priorities in life.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but I'm just upset we didn't get maple, that's why, so I had  to pivot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think I'm with you on the maple, by the way.  Coming up,  Mitt Romney's ribbing -- did you see it?  Former presidential candidate  getting into playoff fever last night with courtside tots during the Utah  Jazz playoff game.  And forget sports drinks and shoe endorsements, Steph  Curry has just landed a major entertainment deal.  Sports is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In the NBA Playoffs, the Houston Rockets are  soaring to new heights.  Jared Max with all the details.  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Houston,  Minnesota has a problem.  James Harden pumped the Rocket fuel in the second  quarter like the team have never seen.  Game three Rockets-Timberwolves.   Houston up two games to one.  Harden scores 22 points in the second  quarter, 22 of the Rockets, 50.  One point off the NBA record set 56 years  ago.  For the most points in the playoff quarter, Harden finish with 36,  Rockets win by 19.  They only need one more win to advance Team Wolves  free,  </p><p>Game four in Salt Lake City, between the Jazz and Thunder running for  Senate in Utah.  Former presidential candidate, Massachusetts Governor Mitt  Romney taunting, talking trash to OKC star, Russell Westbrook.  He keeps  holding up his fingers that there's four -- four fouls.  Eventually,  Russell Westbrook gets his fifth foul and the Jazz win by 17.  Donovan  Mitchell's scored 33.  Utah leads three games to one.  </p><p>Veteran Bay Area T.V. sport anchor and one-time 49ers Receiver Mike Shumann  of KGO T.V. in San Francisco allegedly was caught on video last week in San  Antonio appearing to steal a jacket that belonged to the Golden State  Warriors Head of Security, Ralph Walker.  KGO investigating Shumann,  reportedly sent home from NBA Playoff coverage.  </p><p>Move over Lebron James.  You're not the only NBA superstar making waves in  the entertainment world.  Warriors' great Stephen Curry has chosen Sony  Entertainment Pictures after cording with several industry giants to sign  what is described as a wide-ranging multi-year deal, unanimous media --  that's the company that Steph created recently.  Film, television,  electronics gaming, virtual reality, it's all there for Steph whose  production lot will be in Culver City at Sony Pictures -- life after  basketball.  </p><p>On one side, we have Rob Gronkowski, the New England Patriots Tight End.   And on the other, Rob Gronkowski, just Gronkowski, the 3-year-old cult,  named for the Patriots' tight end.  Rob Gronkowski, the player, recently  bought minority stake in the stakes horse, Gronkowski, who is set to run in  next month's Kentucky Derby.  But, Gronkowski, the horse, had a spike and  fever last weekend, and Gronkowski is not going to be running the Kentucky  Derby, and that's going to be May 5th at Churchill Downs.  Rob Gronkowski,  the person, expressing his lament.  Well, I want to know who gets back on  the field first: Rob Gronkowski the player or Rob Gronkowski the horse?  </p><p>KELLY:  I think Rob Gronkowski should run the Kentucky Derby, he's the true  beast.  I bet he could outrun that horse.  </p><p>MAX:  He said he wanted to get on that horse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, he did?</p><p>MAX:  And that was scary right of at that.</p><p>KELLY:  Would he do it shirtless?  </p><p>MAX:  I don't know what he'd do, but he's got a four time the body mass of  a jockey so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, how about this: racing champ, Matt Kenseth, to make a  return to NASCAR, Dagen.  Big news for NASCAR.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's kind of an exclamation point on what's been going on in the  sport.  Matt Kenseth is returning.  He's going to part-time drive for Roush  Racing this -- the rest of this year.  He's spent about a dozen years  racing for Roush, that's where he was when he won his only cup championship  that was back 2003 before the current playoff series was introduced.  Then,  he raced for Joe Gibbs racing.  Joe Gibbs racing replaced him with the  younger cheaper driver, which is a testament to what's happening in the  sport, is they want young blood.  Again, it's not just the ladies who get  cast aside when they get a little bit older, it's the men the too.  They  want young blood because they think millennials, that will attract to  advertising dollars and they're a lot cheaper.  So, they're trying to get  the salaries down on these drives and attract ads -- attract ad dollars.   Matt Kenseth, luckily, is getting back -- </p><p>KELLY:  Is part-time driving, is that a wave of the future?  I've never  heard really, kind of, part-time. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe, I highly doubt it, because it makes it very hard for  somebody to race, somebody who's only in the car part of the time.  And I  think that would impossible for you to -- if you're only racing part-time,  impossible to win a championship.   </p><p>BRENBERG:  Kevin, I don't think you can get into it.  </p><p>KELLY:  OK.  I've got a day job.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that was it.  That was the first sexist comment I've made.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I said it, so.</p><p>MAX:  Hey, how about -- Jenny Cavnar last time, very cool calls of baseball  game, play-by-play for the Colorado Rockies' first woman, who 25 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was cool.  </p><p>MAX:  Cool stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Catch Jared's sports report Fox News  Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, full steam ahead for phase  two of tax reform.  Kevin Brady in the studio, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.

Good Tuesday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast, a blue chip earnings blitz today.  Six Dow components all  reporting their first-quarter earnings before the opening bell.   Caterpillar leader the way beating expectations on both profit and revenue  while also raising full year guidance.  The stock is up.  The strong  results looking to Dow futures indicating a pretty good rally at the start  of trading this morning.  This is right around the high of the morning up  150 points on the Dow two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds  of a percent as does the NASDAQ for the gain of 38 points right now.   Alphabet beating expectations on both profit and revenue last night, but  the company is raising concerns about expenses as we expected.  The stock  is down this morning, one half of one percent in the premarket. </p><p>Newer markets closed mostly lower yesterday weighed down by yields --  rising bond yields as the 10 year crept closer to three percent.  The DowIndustrials were down 14 points, fractional move on a percentage basis.   S&amp;P was up a fraction and the NASDAQ was down about a quarter of a percent,  17 points.  The Dow was down for a fourth day in a row.  That was the  longest losing streak since March.  In Europe this morning, the indices  look like with the FT-100 showing a gain of 25.  The CAC Quarante is up  fractionally and the DAX Index is up 28 points.  That's a quarter of a  percent higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks closing mostly higher with the  exception of Korea.  Best performer was Shanghai in China the top performer  up at two percent on the session.  In open book for the first time,  Facebook is revealing its secret rules for user posts where the company  says crosses the line.  And then a change of heart, Kentucky Senator Rand  Paul reversed his stance and cleared the way for President Trump's  Secretary of State nominee, Mike Pompeo. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  I've been  opposed to this nomination for a long time.  I hope that they'll let Trump  be Trump and that Pompeo will be a constructive influences and not a  destructive one.  But from what I've been told and listened to with  director I think that he is open and understands that his job is -- that  the president is his boss. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator Rand Paul coming up about  his Pompeo decision.  Join us at 8:30 this morning in about 30 minutes for  that special interview.  And then cashing in on the crypto craze, the  details as Goldman Sachs makes its first hire for the cryptocurrency  market.  All those stories coming up Tuesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, The King's College  Business Economics Professor Brian Brenberg, and Benchmark Managing Partner  Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes.  It's great to be here  especially during earnings week. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A third of the S&amp;P reporting earnings this week.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  And  having a little effect today.  The Dow is up.  There are some good news  coming already this morning.  Maybe CAC won't dominate the week.  Maybe  some of these bread and butter companies in the economy will dominate the - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you got Amazon coming out on Thursday.  You got Qualcomm  and Intel coming out tomorrow and Thursday. </p><p>KELLY:  And Pulte actually reported this morning and the home builders are  doing exceptionally well.  They've consistently beat.  There were worries  about, you know, with rising interest rates how that's going to affect.   But we have a limited supply of housing in the United States here.  It's a  big over hang and that's why you're seeing the rental markets still do well  in face of that. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  With home building and  construction they'll watch for rising import costs, watch for rising  inflation.  There were a bunch of stories being passed around last week  about condo developers killing projects and say Toronto because of the  rising material costs, and that was one of the things that fueled the move  out of treasury bonds here I think.  And, again, I think that if you -- if  you top 30 percent yield on 10 year could be very, very rough going through  the stock market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, I don't know why though.  I mean -- OK.  So it's  three percent but you're still talking about rock bottom numbers.  I mean  why would so afraid three percent. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- worrying about the Federal Reserve overreacting to inflation  concerns and they start worrying about you hit three, you start worrying  about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  It's a bigger percentage move to go from two percent to three  percent then three percent to four percent.  It's actually -- and in an  economy that's going to have over three percent GDP growth this year, you  look at the nominal grow -- I mean it's unbelievable. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's unprecedented unwinding of unprecedented stimulus  from our central bank and I don't think anybody knows how that's going to  end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many people have come on this program and said to us the  biggest risk to economic growth right now is the Federal Reserve?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We talked about it in last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big conversation this morning about all of the above.  Joining  the conversation Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul is with me today.  I will get his take on his last minute  reversal to vote in favor of Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State, the  budget, and a lot more.  Don't miss that special interview coming up.  But  first is our top story is earnings in focus, six Dow companies are  reporting earnings this morning including Travelers, 3M, Coca-Cola.  They  had mixed reports overall.  But United Technologies, Caterpillar, and  Verizon all beat on earnings and revenue for the first quarter and all of  those stocks are trading higher.  Caterpillar was one that was really  closely watched because that is a big indicator of global economic  activity.  Futures right now indicating a big gain at the start of trading.   Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points right out of the gate, two- thirds of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up half a percent right now, 35  points higher.  And joining us right now to talk more about all that is The  Gartman Letter Editor and Publisher Dennis Gartman.  Dennis, good to see  you sir.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE GARTMAN LETTER:  Always honored  to be on.  Thanks for asking me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get to the fundamentals if you will in terms of  earnings, let's talk technical because I know you like to look at the  charts.  What do the charts tell you right now, Dennis, in terms of where  we are in the stock market rally?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think it's -- it bothers me greatly that we have seen the  highs.  I'm quite convince in both the market here in the United States and  globally, so I'm actually in the long-term quite bearish of equities, I  think that we've got the monetary authorities here in the United States  already erring upon the side of tighter monetary policy.  We've seen the  adjusted monetary based on about 10 percent from its highs.  That's not  going to change anytime soon.  We're allowing the monetary base to roll  off.  We're probably going to see the ECB begin to tighten.  The only bank  of consequence that won't be tightening the monetary policy anytime soon is  the Bank of Japan and as long as the monetary authority is on balance are  beginning that process they're taking away the liquidity that has sponsored  the Bull market.  So technically, I'm actually quite bearish.  In the short  run, we got so terribly oversold two weeks ago that we're having a good  bounce.  We shouldn't be surprised by this, but if we took the Dow up  another 150 to 200, I guarantee you I shall be selling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget though that there's this narrative right now  that things aren't going to slow down.  Dagen, they've got this massive  balance to walk the Federal Reserve does.  Even Robert Kaplan from the  Dallas Federal Reserve last week said, he wants this two more rate hikes a  total of three for this year because while he's expecting 2.6 percent or  2.7 percent growth this year, he thinks growth plummets down to one and  three-quarters percent by the end of '19, so there's this narrative that  things are going to start slowing down in a big way. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's something -- that echoes how Stephanie Pomboy has  felt about this economy.  But to -- what we're talking about the Federal  Reserve winding down that balance sheet, that's -- they've laid out a plan  to do that.  And it would require something really extreme and dramatic in  the economy for them to change course at this point on that note.  And I  don't think people really understand what this economy looks like with the  markets look like without all of that buying by Federal Reserve, and one  thing I would just point out and it's to kind of pivot a little bit but  watch these NAFTA negotiations to sort of going on.  They resumed today  behind closed doors with Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative,  representatives from Canada and that's -- they're trying to do something by  the end of next week.  President Trump is threatening to change it or pull  out of it on his own, can he do it?  There's a lot of pushback in Congress.   Again, Europe and Mexico have just inked a trade deal.  We're getting left  behind and this could roil markets.  I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anything is going to roil markets if no NAFTA deal and if the  U.S. pulls out and then we've got no trade going on with China and Mexico.   I totally agree that the markets looking -- go ahead Dennis, jump in. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Well, yes.  We have to pay attention what's going on in the NAFTA  talks because what a lot of people are forgetting to understand is that  there's a presidential election coming up in Mexico on July 1st and the  fellow who's going to win that unless something untoward is to change is an  overt Marxist then we have to pay attention to that fact.  We need to get  this NAFTA agreement passed and passed very quickly, and if it doesn't pass  in the next two or three weeks or certainly in the next month then there's  trouble ahead.</p><p>KELLY:  Dennis, you think we've hit peak market right here and I think one  of the things to be cognizant of is that because of the multiples?  And you  don't think that we should be trading at 18 times earnings, maybe we should  be trading times 16 times earnings because we're anticipating to make 150  some dollars this year in earnings on the S&amp;P 500, next year 170, so the  earning story is going to get better, but are what you're saying -- are you  saying that people aren't going to be willing to pay up for that? </p><p>GARTMAN:  I think 18 times earnings is relatively high.  We could get to 20  times earnings.  I don't -- I don't doubt that for a moment.  But what  bothers me and what people are not paying attention to is historically,  stock markets do indeed make their highs long before economic activity  turns down.  What ends up happening at the bottom is the monetary  authorities begin to impact expansionary.  That money moves into equities  before it moves into planned equipment and labor, and at the peak as plant,  and equipment, and labor demands capital back, and while the monetary  authorities are beginning to tighten, there is less -- there is less  liquidity to sponsor plant equipment and labor, and so the money comes out  of the stock market.  It's very normal. </p><p>It's very historically unprecedented and I think that that's indeed what's  going to be happening here over the course of next year or two.  So yes,  the economy in the United States doing quite well.  I do not doubt that for  a moment.  It's going to continue to do well for another year or two, but  it's going to be very difficult unless the monetary authorities become  expansionary once again and they shall not do that, Dagen, I think it's  absolutely right.  They've laid out the plans very clearly as to how  they're going to run off or allow these -- the debt securities - the  treasury's that they own to run off out of maturity.  They're not going to  be expansionary and that's going to be contractionary for the equities over  time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to do then?  What do you do about the  portfolio then, Dennis?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think you go to cash.  I think you go to short-term treasury  securities.  I think you go to the ETF's that are short-term bond funds and  I think you sit on the sidelines and wait.  I think sometimes the sidelines  is not a bad place to be, not too many people want to always be 100 percent  invested.  As I've said in my newsletter in a bear market, there are three  positions you can have, very bearish, modestly bearish or neutral, right  now, perhaps neutrality is the best position of all to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Dennis, always great  insights from you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Well, see you soon, sir, Dennis Gartman  there.  President Trump will host French president Emmanuel Macron  meanwhile at a state dinner tonight.  But the Iran nuclear deal will be top  of this agenda ahead of the festivities.  Blake Burman at the White House  right now with the latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  There is already that dinner last night.  The official state  dinner is later this evening and in between later this morning will be the  official bilateral meeting between President Trump and Emmanuel Macron.  A  host of different issues on the plate for the two world leaders, but non- possibly bigger than the Iran nuclear deal.  The White House is standing  behind its stance that the president believes this is a bad deal.  He has a  decision to make about whether to stay in or possibly get out by May 12th.   Ahead of the visit, Macron was saying that the president should not leave  the Iran nuclear deal if there is not a Plan B.  Iran's Foreign Minister  agreed and the Iranian president now has sent out this warning saying and,  \"If someone wants to betray our nation and the deal, grave consequences  will affect them.\"  The Press Secretary yesterday Sarah Sanders was  noncommittal about the possibility of a realistic Plan D. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does the White House believe that there is actually a  realistic Plan B out there? </p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We certainly think that there  should be a better deal one that actually is positive that works.  And we  don't really typically look to the leadership in Iran to determine what our  foreign policy is. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Beyond that Maria, they will -- are expected President Trump and  Macron to be discussing trade issues, of course, the situation inside  Syria, and also the Paris Climate Accord.  Once Macron wraps up his visit  here at White House, he's not over here in Washington, D.C. because  tomorrow he will address Congress, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the joint session of Congress tomorrow.  Blake will be  watching that as well.  Thanks so much.  Blake Burman at the White House.   Coming up, Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo wins support of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee after Senator Rand Paul changes his  mind.  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator about why he flipped his vote  coming up.  And then Goldman Sachs jumps on the Bitcoin bandwagon, the  company's new higher in the cryptocurrency market right here next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Police in Toronto is still searching for motive  in yesterday's deadly van rampage.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police  have identified the suspect who drove that van, 25-year-old Alek Minassian  of Toronto.  He's currently under arrest charge with killing 10 people and  injuring 15 others.  Witnesses said it was chaos. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He just went on the sidewalk.  He just started hitting  everybody -- a bus stop everything got shattered because there are a lot of  people got hurt.  I've seen the scene I've never seen in my life. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Officials are still trying to determine his motive but they say so  far there's no evidence the attack is linked to terrorism.  This happened  while foreign ministers leading G7 nations or holding talks in Toronto.   Well, former President George H. W. Bush has been hospitalized just one day  after the funeral for his wife Barbara.  According to Houston Methodist  Hospital, the 93-year-old Bush is being treated for an infection that has  spread to his blood.  A spokesman says Bush is responding to treatment and  appears to be recovering.  Well, Goldman Sachs reportedly is getting  serious about investing in digital currency.  They've just hired Justin  Schmidt as the first cryptocurrency trader for the market unit.  This comes  as Goldman is looking to set up a trading desks to actually trade  cryptocurrency. </p><p>Goldman already handles trades the Bitcoin futures for some clients.   Morgan Stanley does the same.  Shares of Goldman are down one percent so  far this year.  And then Maria, take a look at this birdie that this golfer  did not want.  A Michigan high school student was about to tee off when a  goose attacked him on the course.  It turns out this goose was sitting on  her egg in a nest decided to do to defend herself.  He fell over.  Only his  ego was bruised.  These birds are mean, Maria.  We had one on our farm in  Texas and that goose at the time when I was a kid attacked me and bit me.   Watch out for these things. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, knocked him right over. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Respect for the goose.  Respect for the goose.  I worked on a  golf course.  You know what, you're in their territory.  You better getting  -- </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the mama was protecting her --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holly Mollie.  OK.  Coming up heroism in the face of tragic.   We'll speak with James Shaw Jr. live.  Yes, the courageous man who stopped  the Waffle House shooter.  He's coming up next.  And then another big day  of earnings, Verizon one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell.   The company beat first quarter earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll  break down the numbers coming up.  And in roughly 10 minutes, I'll speak  with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member Rand Paul.   Join us with the senator coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The man accused of killing four people at a  Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee this weekend is expected to make his  first appearance in court this morning after police in Tennessee arrested  him yesterday ending a nearly 36 hour  manhunt.  The accused gunman 29- year-old Travis Reinking opened fire with an assault style rifle early  Sunday morning fatally wounding four people in and outside the restaurant  before a customer intervened, James Shaw Jr. managed to tackle the gunman  and wrestle away his rifle.  Undoubtedly saving more lives.  Joining us  right now is the hero himself, Waffle House help James Shaw Jr.  Mr. Shaw,  thank you so much for joining us this morning and congratulations and thank  you to you.</p><p>JAMES SHAW JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  Thank you for inviting me and having me  on your show. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just incredible what you did.  Tell us what was going  through your mind.  Was this just an immediate reaction, you saw what was  happening and you just jumped to try to tackle this guy?  What happened? </p><p>SHAW:  So by the time he entered, I was -- he had already shot towards the  bathroom and that's when a bullet grazed my upper -- I have to try to -- in  this situation.  And then once I noticed that he was refilling -- reloading  the gun --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reloading, yes.</p><p>SHAW:  Yes, reloading his gun.  The barrel was down and I just choose then  to, you know, my opportunity to attack because I didn't see like I was  going to have another window.</p><p>BRENBERG:  James, Brian Brenberg here.  Thank you for everything you did.   One of the things I really appreciated about how you reflected on this as  you said, look, I was actually just trying to save my own life.  I wasn't  trying to be a hero necessarily, you know, was it really just in that  moment, you know, I'm in danger, what do I have to do?  Did you see others  around you at all and think about what can I do to maybe, you know, create  a solution for the folks in this dinner as well?  How are you thinking  about that? </p><p>SHAW:  So when he -- like I said when he first started coming in, he shot  towards the bathroom and there were -- there was probably six or seven of  us in the separate bathrooms in the men or women's bathroom, however, I was  actually in the hallway because I didn't want to go in the bathroom because  there's -- I mean there's only one way out.  So I didn't want to go in the  bathroom, so I just went to keep an eye on him and then it worked out in my  favor because I saw him reloading and I just made it up in my mind that if  he was going to kill me he was going to have to work for this kill, and I'm  grateful, and very glad that I did do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean do you understand how many people you saved because  later they found all of these bullets and magazines in his pocket, he was  pretty locked and loaded and could have killed a lot of people that day?</p><p>SHAW:  Right.  That's the, you know, the day it happened, of course, I  didn't know that he had all that in his jacket pocket.  But I was -- I was  guessing that he did have, you know, was going to reload or do something,  so I'm glad that I intervened and I'm glad to have saved myself and saved  everybody else also.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was he naked?  Was he naked, James, because he did -- he got  out of the car initially naked with the green jacket, right? </p><p>SHAW:  Yes, he was he was naked.  He was only wearing the green jacket,  yes, ma'am. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, how -- this is Dagen McDowell, how has this changed your  outlook on life say human nature? </p><p>SHAW:  So after I visited some of the victims that were in critical  condition at Vanderbilt Hospital, they are now in stable condition now.  I  want to go and get something to eat at Panera Bread and, now, instead of me  looking for the exit, I actually completely sat beside the exit.  When I  was walking downtown for another interview, I can't help but not look -- I  mean look over my shoulder.  It's just, you know, right now, it's hard for  me to trust strangers because of this incident because it makes it really,  really tough to trust that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  James, it's so wonderful to have you on the show.  Thank  you.  We owe you a debt all of us do, and we love you James.  Thank you so  much.  You're a hero.  </p><p>SHAW:  All right.  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Shaw Jr. joining us there.  Congratulations, sir.  Coming  up, I'll speak with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul.  He weighs in on the Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, tax  reform, and a lot more.  Rand Paul right after this break.  And then  Caterpillar, one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell this  morning, the equipment company beat first quarter earnings and revenue  estimates.  We break down the other blue chip results after this.  Back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  The blue chip buzz on  Wall Street.  Six Dow components all reporting earnings before the opening  bell this morning.  Caterpillar leading the way beating expectations on  profit and revenue also raising its full-year guidance.  The stock is up  better than four percent.  United Technologies and Verizon also delivering  a double beat on revenue as well as profits.  The numbers are lifting the  stocks involved, although 3M is down four percent on the opposite.  Futures  however showing a big gain at the start of trading this morning.  </p><p>Take a look, Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points at the open,  that's two-thirds of one percent.  We got the S&amp;P 500 up 15 and the NASDAQ  up 32 points, that's also one-half of one percent.  In Europe this morning,  the indices are higher across the board.  FT-100 up 26 points, the CAC  Quarante up a half a point, and the DAX Index in Germany up just four  points, fractional moves for most of these indices.  In Asia overnight,  stocks closed mostly higher.  The Shanghai Composite in China, the best  performer, up nearly two percent overnight.</p><p>Kicking off this half an hour, a hurdle cleared on the CIA Director Mike  Pompeo's nomination to be Secretary of State.  The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee approved the nomination with a vote of 11 to nine.  This coming  after a key holdout changed his mind in the 11th hour.  Joining me right  now in a first on Fox Business interview, member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  Senator Paul, good to  see you, Sir, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you change your mind?</p><p>PAUL:  You know, I think we've been at war for too long and too many places  and I think the President tends to agree with me, but I wanted him to be  surrounded by advisers who also agree with the President.  You know, the  President said very clearly the Iraq war was a mistake.  I think the Iraq  war is part of the most instructive foreign policy disaster of the last  couple decades, and we should learn from it, and I kept asking Director  Pompeo, was the Iraq war a mistake, do you agree with the President?  I  wasn't getting a good answer, but finally, over the last few days, I got  more a succinct answer from both the President and from Director Pompeo and  a promise that he will be very public with saying that he does agree with  the President's vision of the world.  I think that combined with fact that  the President now has opened the door to negotiations with North Korea and  that Pompeo is part of that.  All of that figured into it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I was reading your tweets yesterday, I guess,  after you had a meeting with the President and you said that based on your  conversation, you believed that Secretary Pompeo agreed with the President  that, in fact, less entanglements is better than more entanglements.</p><p>PAUL:  I guess it's a good way to put it in general.  We're probably not  all in exactly the same place.  I'm ready to leave Afghanistan yesterday.   I wouldn't send one more soldier there.  I don't think they're exactly  there but I think even Pompeo in his written questions admitted there is no  military solution to Afghanistan.  And my point is if there's no military  solution, why would you send one more young man or woman over there to risk  their life? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand what you're saying, but then there's  Syria, and the President recently said, look, we're going to be taking our  men and women home from Syria relatively soon.  And that created a lot of  upset, because even people like General Jack Keane, four-star general,  says, look if you pull out of Syria right now, you're going to have a  vacuum just the way we pulled out of Iraq and ISIS will get stronger.  Do  you disagree with that, Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Yes, this is -- absolutely disagree with it.  This is the answer of  all the neo-cons, they want to stay everywhere and they predict profound,  you know, disaster if we ever leave.  But that's an answer -- that's a sort  of response that has a staying everywhere all of the time, so no.  I think  Syria should be -- I think one of the ideas that's been floated is having  more local countries participate in it.  The people who live there ought to  be manning the armies.  We live thousands of miles away.  We shouldn't have  to occupy and keep the peace in every country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, fair enough, but do you agree that when President Obama  pulled out of Iraq, it created a vacuum and created ISIS.</p><p>PAUL:  No, I would say that when we attacked Saddam Hussein and toppled  him, we created a vacuum and a crisis and chaos there, and it's persistent  to this day.  When you look at ISIS and where ISIS actually arose, ISIS  arose in the civil war of Syria not in Iraq.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Senator, did the President make any promises to you as far  as pulling out of Syria?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we talked more in general terms and I don't think it's  really appropriate to try to pin him down on, hey, we have to leave by next  week or I'm not voting for him.  But I heard loud and clear from the  President, and I tell you, loud and clear, and with very specific language,  that he's very much in my -- you know, with me on a lot of the ideas that  we've been at war too long in too many places.  And I think people are  going to be surprised over the next year or two that I think there will be  some ending of some of the wars around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the issues, of course, with that omnibus bill  recently was the fact that this is a $1.3-trillion omnibus bill, but the  fact that the GOP wanted to protect the military.  And that's why we ended  up spending all of that money which, of course, was really an issue for a  lot of conservatives, you included.</p><p>PAUL:  I think it's -- yes, I think it's probably the opposite, though, I  think if you spend yourself into a $22-trillion debt, you actually make  your country weaker.  So, I disagree with those people who say, oh, we got  to expand, we got to give a blind check to the military.  I think it's  actually making us weaker as we go further and further into debt.  So, I  think our national security is best protected by not having our mission too  large.  I think our mission is too large or in too many countries.  We  don't have left -- money left over to upgrade our nuclear arsenal, upgrade  our missile defenses and to actually pay our troops better.  So, I would do  all those things but I would do it and pay for it by actually not being in  Afghanistan and spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that we should have disallowed the government  to close down then for this omnibus?  Because House Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy was in the studio here yesterday and he takes aim at your chamber  for the massive amount of spending.  Listen to this, Sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  (INAUDIBLE) why you  even got into an omni.  The House did all the work.  We passed all 12 of  our appropriation bills.  The challenge was the minority in the Senate, not  voting against the appropriation bill, but voting against to even allow it  to come up to be debated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, your reaction?</p><p>PAUL:  Some true and some untrue.  We actually I don't think ever  filibustered an appropriation bill in the last year.  We didn't bring them  up, so the Senate did not do a shot.  The appropriation bill were not  brought forward in a timely fashion one at a time, but I don't believe  there was ever (AUDIO GAP) hearing them as much as I'm against spending I  typically will vote not to filibuster spending bills and to actually hear  the spending bills.  So, true and not so true, what he said.  But I do  think that the point is that we're spending too much money on what the  leadership in the House are bragging about that they put forward, was a  disaster to conservatives because it was a gross overspending of money and  spending of money.  We're actually going to have a trillion-dollar deficit  this year as bad as Obama.  That's what we ran against.  So, I think it's a  great deal of hypocrisy going on right now with the Republican leadership,  allowing and actually supporting budgets that we railed against when they  were President Obama's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I want to talk to you about your penny plan but  before I get there, do you -- are you in favor of this rescission plan to  actually rescind some of the spending?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  I haven't seen exactly what's in it, so we need to know  what's in it before we decide how to vote on it but actually (INAUDIBLE)  clawing back and spending less money is what I've been pitching for a long  time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about your penny plan to balance the federal budget?   Tell us about it.</p><p>PAUL:  The penny plan, I think, is easier to get broad bipartisan support  for because it doesn't cut all of one program, it cuts one percent of every  program, and frankly, I think there's enough waste even in the military to  cut one percent of it, and make government more efficient.  The only way  you'll ever get rid of waste in government is to give them less funds.  If  you say, oh, we've got waste, we're going to cut waste next year but we're  going to give you a hundred billion dollars more in the Pentagon, there  won't be any waste cut.  If we give you one percent less, they'll be waste  cut, but if you cut one percent a year, the penny plan, for five years, the  budget actually balances.  I've introduced that now and we will force a  vote on the Senate.  In the next week or two, we will get a vote on my  budget, and also have reconciliation instructions to allow a simple  majority in the Senate to vote to expand health savings accounts to every  American.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, is spending on the wall in your budget because it's  pretty extraordinary that we're talking about a $47-trillion budget here  and there wasn't even a $25 billion that the President wanted for his wall?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we have to have border security and it is part of our  national security to have border security.  I think we can debate on how  much it should cost.  Some of the estimates of $20 million a mile, I think,  are outlandish.  And I think we can also use technology.  I've met some  young inventors who talked about using sonar and cameras and other things  that really wouldn't be a wall for 2000 miles.  I think we can use walls in  some of the urban areas, but I think, really, we ought to use technology.   It's much less expensive in many of the other areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, did you discuss this with the President yesterday?</p><p>PAUL:  We didn't talk about the wall so much.  We really talked about his  vision of the world and war.  His concern for the veterans, he talked about  his trips with Walter Reed and talked about, you know, meeting the veterans  and being affected the same way all of us are as we see these young men who  have sacrificed so much.  And that's why I say not one soldier more.  I  mean, if there's no military mission, if there -- you know, there's no  military mission left really in Syria for goodness sakes, it's going to be  a political solution, same with Yemen, same with Afghanistan.  So, if these  are going to be political solutions, let's quit sending our soldiers there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about what Lindsey Graham says, and that is, look,  you may be tired of fighting with the extremists but guess what, they're  not tired of fighting with you.</p><p>PAUL:  He's been wrong about every foreign policy sort of pronouncement of  the last 40 years.  He's a neoconservative who really doesn't have concern  for the constitution or the bill of rights but really wants to be at war  everywhere.  And I think the wars are bankrupting us and I think sometimes  you create more terrorists than you kill.  If you want to go to every  remote village in Africa and kill a chieftain over there and say, oh, we  got somebody from Al-Qaeda, well, you create 10 for every you kill.  So, I  think he's been wrong about most things like this, and I think people would  be wise to think through what he's been saying because it's bankrupting our  country and it's a terrible foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know that there are a number of programs going  bankrupt like entitlements like Social Security, like Medicare, like  Medicaid.  Now, we're getting new details about a phase two tax cut plan.   I spoke with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady earlier  this morning, here's what he said.  Listen to this, Senator. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  This  year, we're looking at issues like, can we help families save more and  earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in the  United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not yet  permanent provisions of the tax cut?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's talking about make things permanent like the individual  tax cuts, like the expensing, would you support a phase two tax cut plan,  Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  And I think this is something, you know, many of the  Democrats were complaining and saying, oh, the tax cuts are not going to be  permanent, so it's not really going to help individuals.  Well, I think  we'd like to make it permanent and if the Democrats would join with us, I  think we could make the individual tax side permanent.  And really, the  individual side is where we really helped a lot of the working class out  with this recent tax cut.  So, making that permanent would be a huge step  forward, and hopefully, the Democrats who criticized us over that will join  us to make it permanent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see where that leads.  And real quick,  finally, Iran's President, Senator, is warning that the U.S. is going to  see grave consequences if Washington withdraws from the 2015 Iran nuclear  deal.  This coming as the French President Emmanuel Macron is said to hold  talks with the President today over that nuclear deal and threats from  North Korea and Syria.  Macron wants to urge the President to not withdraw  from the controversial agreement.  Your expectation, Sir.</p><p>PAUL:  I think the most important thing is, is Iran adhering to the  agreement, and so far, all indications have been that they adhered to it.   I don't think it was the best agreement in the world, and I think we could  have done better, but we have the agreement.  It is a multilateral  agreement in the sense that many other countries joined with us in the  agreement, so I think it would be a mistake to exit hastily from it,  particularly if Iran is adhering to it.  Now, there's a more complicated  arms race going on in the Middle East, and people have to realize that Iran  reacts to Saudi Arabia, that is their rival in the region.  So, when we  sell $300 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Iran will react and  continue to develop their weapons.  So, people have to realize that it is  an action and a reaction, and that it can't be seen just as, oh, here is  evil, Iran, and they're creating weapons.  Well, they're doing it in  response to Saudi Arabia, back-and-forth.  Who started it?  I don't know,  but it is an arms race. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Senator, it's good to see you, Sir.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>PAUL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great conversation.  Senator Rand Paul joining us there in  Washington.  Coming up, Coca-Cola one of six Dow companies reporting before  the opening bell this morning.  The company beat earnings and revenue  expectations due in part to a Diet Coke reboot.  Stuart Varney will weigh  in on the earnings split this morning.  Then retirement realities, the  shocking study that says your employer could be to blame for limited  retirement savings.  We'll get into it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're covering earnings.  The story on Wall  Street this morning, Caterpillar lifting the Dow Industrials after a  stronger-than-expected first quarter.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of  the New York Stock Exchange with the breakdown.  Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  thus far, we've seen earnings coming in, 19 percent of the S&amp;P 500  companies have come in, and you have 78 percent of those beat again  earnings per share.  And let's put Caterpillar right in there, it's been a  busy earnings week.  Stock is up 3.6 percent, beating on both the top and  bottom line.  We saw profit sales and also the full-year outlook also  raised.  So, you have a beat across the board here for Caterpillar, higher  demand, better-than-expected sales.  We heard from Citigroup yesterday.   They did put a buy rating on this particular stock.  They added nearly  11,000 jobs, and the increased volume helped to boost total sales by 38  percent.  I will note that the stock is down about nine percent since its  last quarter, concerns about the trade dispute.  Trade worries have  certainly hit some stocks.  </p><p>Then, we take a look at another mover, and that is Wells Fargo.  Wells  Figer (ph) -- Fargo, right now, is up about a half of one percent.  But  today is the shareholder meeting, it's in Des Moines, Iowa, not in San  Francisco.  There would have been even more protesters, activists.  You  know, regulators have been on this.  The Trump administration has been  tough on this one, fining Wells Fargo a billions dollars for the car  insurance and mortgage abuses, but it was a year and a half ago, for fake  accounts, millions of them, and today, the activists and the shareholders  are going to get in there and voice their opinion.  They're calling for the  CEO to be fired and for the board to be removed, and even a breakup of it  because they believe it's too big and too bloated.  Of course, Wells Fargo  saying that they've been doing all that they can and they want to listen  and make some more changes.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Nicole, thank you.  Coca-Cola  seeing a nice pop this morning after beating expectations on its profit and  revenue estimates.  The sales surged following the company's risky Diet  Coke reboot.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney  to weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's what got me, Maria.  If  you look inside that earnings report from Coca-Cola, there's something very  interesting going on.  Five percent organic growth.  Now, Maria, you know I  hate this jargon stuff.  I take that as growth from the inside of the  company, as opposed to growth by acquisition.  Five percent growth for a  health and beverage company, I should say a beverage company is very  unusual.  Turns out that Diet Coke was the driver of this organic growth.   And Coke Zero was a close second.  It's expanding at a double-digit rate.   Apparently, I don't -- I never touch this stuff, but apparently, they've  got all kinds of brand-new flavors, like ginger, and apparently, that's a  really big deal.  And up goes their earnings, up goes the stock, I think  that's a cultural phenomenon because we always thought that soda, classic  soda, sugar-water was going out, and so it is, but flavored drinks with no  sugar, apparently are doing very well.  I think that's a cultural shift on  the part of the millennials.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true because people are trying to avoid sugar, so they  figured a way around it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's it.  That's it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coca-Cola did.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink that stuff?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's nice to see that kind of innovation from within,  you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't.  I don't drink soda but I used to drink Diet Coke and  that was my favorite soda, Diet Coke, but I haven't had it in years.</p><p>VARNEY:  As long as it's got caffeine in it, that's why I drink Mountain  Dew, OK?  That's it.  You (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My coffee does that for me.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, great to see you.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  We can discuss this endlessly, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But I know you've got a lot out on the Macron visit,  so we're going to be there in 10 minutes, Stu, thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart as he looks into that meeting between the  President and President Macron.  First though, could your boss be to blame  for lack of retirement savings.  Details on the shocking study that could  affect your financial future, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans struggling with savings for the  golden years, one in three people have nothing stashed away for retirement,  nothing, according to gobankingrates.com.  Just over half have saved less  than $10,000.  Now, a new study suggest their employers may be partially to  blame.  Joining us now, the author of \"Retire Inspired\" and Ramsey  Solutions' Financial Expert, Chris Hogan.  Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, only 59 percent of Americans have access to a 401(k) plan  through their employer.  Is that the issue?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the bigger issue is really, Maria, people understanding just  how important it is that we take steps to be able to help ourselves.  So, I  think it's less about trying to blame the employer, if they don't have  access and it's more about taking personal responsibility.  Victim-thinking  is a dangerous think in this country, but we have to do is have personal  responsibility.  And people are doing it, they're waking up and they're  starting to listen as I travel and speak around the country.  They just  need to know what steps to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, bottom line, if you don't have access to a 401(k), open an  IRA?</p><p>HOGAN:  That's exactly correct.  And think of an IRA as just an account, an  arrangement that allows you to save for yourself with stocks, bonds, mutual  funds, but people don't know what steps to take and where to go.  So, I  want them to reach out, talk to an investment professional, really start to  sit down and understand the landscape, your goals, your timing, as well as  your opportunities, and we can start to take steps in the right direction.</p><p>KELLY:  Chris, one of the best things you could do is open up a Roth IRA,  if you're -- if you're a younger investor because it's after tax money, it  grows tax free, and it's -- they're -- it's easy to invest in.  Are you  seeing people to utilize Roth IRAs?</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, Roth IRAs are a beautiful thing, and you're right, it is  after-tax dollars, so it gives you tax-free growth.  More and more people  are hearing this and waking up to it.  I'm getting calls into show \"Retire  Inspired\" where young people, 23, 24 years old are asking about it, but at  the same time, I'm hearing from people in their 50s and 60s that didn't  understand what was at stake and what they could do.  So, yes, we need to  keep spreading the word and helping people understand the tools that they  have available to them.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Chris, what's the biggest misconception people have about IRAs  that keep them from investing?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the biggest misconception is that people don't understand how  easy it is to open, they think it's a -- it's a very difficult complex  process, and it's really not.  It's a matter of a couple documents and then  you starting to fund it.  So, people understanding how easy it is I think  it allowed them to take more advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always great advice.  Pay yourself first, that means save first  before you spend.  Chris, thank you so much, great to see you, Sir.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you, ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris Hogan.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star  panel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some breaking news on United Technologies.  Not only  did it beat expectations, the company is just saying that it will  repatriate $3.8 billion from overseas to the United States.  That,  obviously, is exactly what the President wanted from his tax cut plan.   United Technologies will repatriate that money in overseas cash as a result  of the tax cut plan.  </p><p>Final thoughts from this all-star panel, right now.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  We're focusing on tech earnings.  Do you focus on the e-commerce,  the ecosystem, and look at the companies that service them?  Industrial  (INAUDIBLE) have done exceptionally well, Prologis last week actually  talked about how they're growing 25 percent.  So, if you can't get your  returns in tech, get the companies that are the backbones for them.  Stuff  from (INAUDIBLE) data centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Brian?  Brian?</p><p>BRENBERG:  You can talk a lot about cloud computing today.  I think it's  going to be a big week for Microsoft, for Amazon, too, that's a growing  business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And credit to Kevin, he turned me on to highball  energy drinks and I used to dismiss them.  And so, his feelings were hurt.   That, and making fun of you earlier about the --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KELLY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, April 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Blue chips buzz on Wall Street, earnings for six Dow components all due out  before the opening bell this morning.  That's in the next two hours.</p><p>Travelers, Coca-Cola, United Technologies just hitting the wire; Coke and  United both beating expectations with their first quarter numbers.   Travelers is coming in mixed, missing on profit.  Take a look at the stocks  right after the numbers are released.  Coca-Cola shares up 1 percent,  United Technologies up one and two-thirds percent, travelers shares down  three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>Check futures this morning.  We are expecting a pretty good rally at the  start of trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 140 points, two- thirds of 1 percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds and the Nasdaq is up two- thirds of 1 percent with a 45-point move.</p><p>This after yesterday when markets closed mostly lower, weighed down by  rising bond yields.  The Dow down for a fourth session in a row, the  longest losing streak since March.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this, take a look.  FT  100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris is flat and the DAX index  in Germany up a quarter of a percent as well.</p><p>Revenues at Travelers were above estimates, by the way, as you see there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly higher.  The shanghai composite the  top performer, up nearly 2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour -- tackling tax cuts phase two as voters  head to the polls this fall for the midterm elections.</p><p>Republicans are hoping to pass another round of tax cuts later this year.   A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that more people view the  Republican tax overhaul as a bad idea, rather than a good one.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas.  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Good morning --  Marie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it amazing to you that we get this poll where it says  that these people -- most people are not seeing the tax plan as a positive?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Well, I think the narrative has been just so brutal for the  past year.  But when they asked the questions, Maria, you get different  answers.  When you ask people you want to keep -- should you be able to  keep more of what you worked so hard to earn, you want to see the standard  deduction doubled, do you want to get more help raising your kids, do you  want to see those paychecks rise?  The answer invariably is yes.</p><p>I think just a general comment you sometimes get a different answer.  But  back home, I can tell you Main Street optimism is at an all-time high.   People are really appreciating just keeping more of what they earn.  And  now, we're seeing dollars come back overseas being invested in America,  exactly the opposite of what we've seen for two decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  So I think that it's very positive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a very powerful legislation.  We know.  We've  seen already a big impact with animal spirits really moving in the  corporate sector.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about phase two.  Do you want to do a phase two  tax cut plan?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I do.  And it's probably different than what most people  think.  We want to change the culture in Washington where once every 30  years we reform the tax code and in between we fall farther behind and we  just do a lot of special breaks.</p><p>We're talking about trying to do what businesses do, which is every year  Congress look at the tax code, ask themselves can we be more competitive as  a country?  Can we be innovative?  Can we be better?  Can we stretch  paychecks farther?</p><p>So this year we're looking at issues like can we help families save more  and earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in  the United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not  yet permanent provisions of the tax code?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to make the cuts for personal permanent.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think that ought to be done.  And I also think there's a 2.0  and a 3.0.  And my point is like businesses, continually getting better  every year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It will evolve?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in terms of expensing and the corporate sector -- what do  you want to see done in terms of business cuts?  </p><p>BRADY:  I have no doubt that that will be made permanent.  The question is  when.  We'll just find the right timing for it because we've already seen  investment unleashed, you know, throughout the economy, because businesses  large and small are now able to write those off, those capital investments  the year they buy them.  It's really powerful.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do about spending, Mr. Chairman?  I mean  we've seen reports in the last few weeks that President Trump wants to claw  back as much as $60 billion from the $1.3 trillion omnibus.  Yesterday we  had Kevin McCarthy in the chair here saying that look, the rescission is  not about the omnibus, it's about looking for revenue that's not used but  you voted for that massive spending bill.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of complaining about that $1.3 million bill.  What are  you going to do about it?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I think that omnibus was about historic rebuilding of  America's national defense -- exactly what we needed to do.  But it's also  a symbol of a broken budget system for more than a decade.  The House is  passing these bills separately in a small way.  The Senate is not able to  pass any.  And so we end up with something no one wants.</p><p>So I think -- I welcome these rescissions.  I think we ought to wake up  every day, looking at wasteful spending, things that aren't a priority, and  so I think these rescissions and this process is a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  So do you think that we will in fact see it?  Because  Mitch McConnell told Neil Cavuto recently it's not even on the table.   We're not going to look at any -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it ought to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're not bringing it to the floor.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think it ought to be.  I think we're -- look I think we're  spending too much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  There is wasteful spending.  That omnibus is because the system is  broken.  And so let's do what we can now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you didn't want to shut down the government.  You didn't  think so enough to say look, I'm not signing this.  </p><p>BRADY:  No.  And look, at the end of the day, I think President Reagan had  two big legacies -- tax reform and rebuilding the military.  So that's  exactly what we're doing in the first two years of President Trump -- tax  reform and rebuilding our national security.  That's important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- there's a narrative out there right now that  things will begin to slow down in 2019.  I spoke with the president of the  Dallas Federal Reserve who said look, yes, we're looking for 2.7 percent  economic growth this year but by the time '19 going into '20 comes along  we're talking about growth of 1.75 percent.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>BRADY:  No, I don't.  Look I think there's been sort of an economic  narrative that America has to settle for this 2 percent growth.  We've seen  that.  It's why we drove tax reform is to break out of that sort of  sluggish economy.</p><p>And so no, I see the economy moving.  But I'll tell you there's two things  we need to do right to maximize off this tax reform.  One -- we need more  customers, that's free trade including a modern NAFTA.</p><p>And second, we need a better workforce.  Because I'll guarantee you, all  across the country companies large and small are turning away work because  they don't have the workforce they need.  That's something the House and  Congress need to address.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the reason that I raise it -- so many people are  expecting that we're going to see better growth numbers continue and that  will pay some part of the tab for the tax cut bill.  And Nancy Pelosi and  the others said it's absolutely BS that anything's going to pay for itself.  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, listen, she is exactly wrong and has been throughout this  whole process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she has.</p><p>BRADY:  And she really misled the American voters about the tax relief they  give but even -- even if you accept the Congressional Budget Office's  numbers, even they admitted revenues will grow after tax reform.  They  increase by a trillion dollars.  So on a static basis, two-thirds of it is  already -- will be recouped already and that's under economic growth I  think that will be ultimately higher than what they predict.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington for  the state visit for the Trump presidency.  The President of France is set  to address a joint session of Congress tomorrow.  What would you like to  hear from the president of France?  </p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it's important for us to have national security  alliances.  That's very important.  We saw the importance of that in Syria.</p><p>Secondly, trade alliances.  Look we do need a modern trading relationship  with all of Europe.  France could play a key role in that.  And so I'd like  to see those ties strengthen as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to see bilateral deals, U.S.-France, U.S.-U.K.?  Is  that the kind of trade story you're talking about?  </p><p>BRADY:  You know, I would like to see more regional (ph) ones because I  think you've been just like -- whether you sell your products to one  business or sell them to a chain with a hundred stores, I like the regional  approach.  But President Trump likes that country by country, believes we  can get better concessions that way.</p><p>So you know, I think they deserve a chance to show that can create the jobs  we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we in NAFTA?  Do you know?  I mean recently Vice  President Mike Pence said look, we're going to be close.  But I keep  questioning it because I know that there are elections in Mexico this  summer.  Are we going to be able to do a deal, get something done, even a  blueprint of a new NAFTA deal before those Mexico elections?  </p><p>BRADY:  I think we can.  I know that the U.S. under Bob Lighthizer, Mexico  and Canada want an agreement.  They've done an awful lot of good work.</p><p>I was down in Mexico City for the seventh negotiating round.  I think  they're very close.  I think at the end of the day, people are debating  what's the best strategy going forward.  I think the best strategy is  deliver to Congress a modern NAFTA that creates more jobs and allows us to  sell more made in America products in Mexico and Canada, that's the best  strategy for the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So far House Speaker Paul Ryan says that he's endorsing  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to replace him when he retires.  Here's what  McCarthy said yesterday about that endorsement when he joined us on the  program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Our top leader has  endorsed but the most important thing here is we have to make sure there's  an opportunity for a Republican to even run for Speaker next year.</p><p>So we have our work cut out for us.  We have a great team in this  conference.  We're fighting hard.  We've got a lot of successes.  But we've  got a November election to go forward.  So it's a little premature -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So look, premature or not, will you support Kevin McCarthy?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Look, I think Kevin McCarthy's done an amazing job.  I think  what Kevin just said there is as a conference, focus on our work, preserve  this majority.  You know, he's going to have an opportunity to show the  great leadership he's done as majority leader, transfers to the  speakership.  We've got to work together to make sure we're competing for a  Speaker's race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to hold on to the majority in the house?  I  mean, you know, most people will say, look, in a presidential, you know,  two terms, typically, you've got even in the middle of one term you've got  that party losing seats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  History's pretty rough -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BRADY:  -- on the majority party.  On the other hand, we're delivering two  of the biggest things with this president in history.  One is a new tax  code that makes America more competitive and actually allows people to keep  more of what they earn.</p><p>And secondly, rebuilding the military in a way that keeps us safer.  And at  the end of the day, I think Americans will have a choice.  They either want  to give back more of their money to a Washington that wastes too much of it  or do they want a new economic growth that people are seeing and feeling  along Main Street.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, will voters hold the Dems to account since not one of  them voted for the tax cut plan?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Not only did no one vote for it, but they want to repeal  those taxes, not to lower the debt, for more Washington spending.  I just  think that goes against -- I haven't, Maria, met anyone in Texas who said I  really wish Washington would take more of what we earn and let's go back to  the old tax code where jobs were going overseas.  I just don't -- I haven't  heard that yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think because of the tax cut plan and its implications  on the economy triggering more growth and you think because of the  protecting of the military, this will be enough to help you hold onto the  majority in the House?  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, I think we have to continue to drive our agenda which is  still to get this economy moving.  I think trade is really important.  I  think a workforce is really important.  And on the rescissions -- doing  everything we can to not waste people's tax dollars.  I think that's an  important part of this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of the work right now and how work might change, the  training, when you say that's very important, what do you want to do?  Are  you going to be putting forth new programs in terms of training employees  for what they need to have going forward?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  You really need three things I think to solve this for the  long term.  We won't get to everything this year.  One -- a smart  immigration policy; secondly, better workforce and Virginia Fox, the  chairwoman of the Education Work Force is leading that but I also think  we've got millions of Americans, Maria, who are on the sidelines in the  welfare system government has sort of given up on.  We haven't.</p><p>We need them and want them back in the workforce.  I think you're going to  see action by the House this year to start that process, to give them some  opportunities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that. </p><p>Let me take you to Texas.  The Supreme Court is set to hear a case today  that could reshape political districts across your home state of Texas.   The case is over whether Texas congressional and state house maps were  drawn with the intent to discriminate against Hispanic and black voters.  A  decision in the case expected some time this summer.  This changes a lot  when you redistrict.  </p><p>BRADY:  It would but I don't think the underlying narrative is accurate.   Look, we're in maps that the courts themselves drew.  You know, they  decided that the legislature hadn't done an appropriate job.  They redrew  the maps to be compliant.  That's what's being challenged here.  And so I  think it's highly unusual for the Supreme Court to overturn a map that's  been drawn by, you know, an independent court in Texas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  I feel like that's what Eric Holder is  spending a lot of his time doing, looking across the country, figuring out  how to redistrict things to get more Democrats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  And you know, what's interesting in Texas is that legislature  has drawn a number of minority seats that Anglo-Democrats or others have  won themselves.  And so at the end of the day, seats are drawn to favor  minority voters.  The voters themselves will choose others for that  position.  And so I really think that the maps are secure.  They're legal.   I think they are fair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me end where I began and that's on taxes.  What kind  of growth is possible this year?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I do think we can be well above 3 percent.  I think it  really depends on ensuring that we're building off the momentum from tax  reform.  Getting trade right I think it really matters to send that signal  that we're now armed with one of the most competitive tax codes in the  world.</p><p>Give us a chance to compete in Mexico and Canada, throughout the world.  I  guarantee you Americans will win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- it's great to see you.</p><p>BRADY:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Brady joining us -- House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>Coming up, a wild scene aboard an American airlines flight after an unruly  passenger was tased with a taser gun 10 times before finally being forcibly  removed from the plane by Miami police.  That's just the beginning of the  story.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>And then from baby watch to name watch -- the world is awaiting the name of  the latest royal after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the hospital  with their third child -- a baby boy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Police in Toronto still searching for a motive in yesterday's deadly van  crash.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details on headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  Police have not  ruled out terrorism as a possible motive.  They have identified though the  suspect who drove that van -- 25-year-old Alek Minassian of Toronto.  He's  currently charged with killing 10 people and injuring 15 others.  This  incident happens while foreign ministers of the G-7 leading industrialized  nations -- Canada, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan -- were  all holding talks in Toronto.</p><p>Well, you're going to he see this -- a dramatic passenger take-down  unfolding on an American Airlines flight.  Miami police tasing a man on- board after he allegedly touched a woman inappropriately and then refused  to leave the plane.  Even other passengers were screaming for him to leave  the plane.</p><p>Jacob Garcia was arrested.  He's facing a slew of charges including  disorderly conduct.  The airline says the flight took for Chicago about an  hour late.  All remaining passengers were on that plane.</p><p>Well, we should also say this -- the CEO of United Airlines is taking now a  pay cut.  Oscar Munoz is giving up his bonus this year.  He's dropping his  compensation for 2017 to $9.6 million from $18.7 million the year before.   You're going to recall that Munoz was criticized heavily for his initial  response to a passenger being violently dragged off a plane last year and  his lack of timing of that response.  United also saying that Chairman  Robert Milton is stepping down.  The board is going to pick a new  independent chairman for the airline.  Taking a look at these stocks right  now -- both of them, American Airlines is down 10 percent so far this year,  UAL is actually up 6 percent for the year.</p><p>And then there is this, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are  leaving us waiting to hear the name of the new royal baby.  But we got  these great pictures.</p><p>Here are the top bets while we're looking.  How cute this is.  Arthur and  James are the two top bets according to the betting polls.  Mom Kate  showing off the baby -- she was wearing a red dress, which the zipping is  similar to the one that Princess Diana wore after Harry was born.  Kind of  interesting.</p><p>Another royal though seemed to have stolen the show yesterday.  Princess  Charlotte -- she's waving to the crowd as she and Prince William walked and  Prince George -- excuse Prince George -- she and Prince George walked to  meet their new baby brother.  The new prince is fifth in line to the throne  behind big sister Charlotte.  She gives a wave to the crowd.  Yes -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And Kate looks great.  I mean of course, she does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Listen, Charlotte stole the show with that little wave.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was the last wave -- the look over the shoulder, the  turn-around and kind of -- yes, it was </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She knows what she's doing.   </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She needs to work on the light bulb.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She's two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's so cute.  Well, look how cut cute she is.   Congratulations to them.  So what do you think the name is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's Arthur too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Arthur.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Charles' name -- their grandfather is Charles Philip Arthur  George, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to go with James.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got a George.  You can't name him Philip because that's  their great grandfather.  So I say Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I say too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm with you.</p><p>Coming up, a late night pivot on Capitol Hill -- a senate panel approved  the confirmation of Mike Pompeo to be the next secretary of state after  Senator Rand Paul dropped his opposition.  I'll speak with Rand Paul later  on in the program.  Join us for that.</p><p>And then who says a monkey can't sue?  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  siding with a human photographer in a copyright fight over a monkey selfie.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New this morning -- a stern warning from Iran.  The country's  leader threatening, quote, \"severe consequences for any country that  betrays the nuclear deal\".  The message comes amid French President  Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the White House.  He's expected to urge  President Trump to not withdraw from the controversial Iran deal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Fox News senior strategic  analyst General Jack Keane.  General -- good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good to see  you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you expect from the talks between the two world  leaders -- Macron and President Trump.  And I want to get your take on this  Iran deal, the deadline is what -- May 12th.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In terms of recertifying it's May 12th.  But listen here's  the framework for the disagreements that we have -- the United States has  with Europeans.  Remember President Trump, what he put in place was a  process to fix the deal versus terminate it.  And if we can't fix it, then  we will terminate it.</p><p>Now, here's what they agree on.  The Europeans and the United States agree  that we should have access to the secret site.  So that should be added to  the deal.  We agree that we should also prohibit ballistic missile testing.   So that would be added to the deal.</p><p>But here's what we fundamentally disagree on.  We are a proponent of ending  the sunset clauses which gives -- which gives the Iranians a threshold  nuclear capability 10 years from the date the deal was signed, that was  July 2015; and 15 years of pathway to actual nuclear weapons.</p><p>The European as of now will not budge over that.  So I think that will be  the point of contention and a point of discussion between President Trump  and Macron today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised that the leader of Iran comes out and says  that there will be consequences if you get out of this Iran deal?  </p><p>KEANE:  No.  That kind of rhetoric has been there forever.  They talk about  every single year destroying the state of Israel, driving the United States  out of the region.  We're the big Satan.  They always have a huge amount of  rhetoric and bluster in terms of what they're trying to do.</p><p>I mean what is surprising is that their foreign minister is in this country  Sharif -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday and giving  him a stage to create a propaganda move, you know, in terms of his position  on the nuclear deal.</p><p>Anyway -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- I think there will be substantive discussions today.  The  President is not going to budge on trying to get this deal fixed.  I'm  hoping that Pompeo gets confirmed here pretty quick -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- so he can get his head into the negotiations with the Europeans.   He may be able to achieve something that our other diplomats have not been  able to achieve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he cleared that key hurdle yesterday in the confirmation  for secretary of state making it pass the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee last night.  The Senate now expected to approve the director  after he earned the support of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>General Keane -- this is a big relief for the administration given what's  going on in the world today, from North Korea to Iran, ISIS.  We need a  secretary of state in place.  </p><p>KEANE:  There's no doubt about that.  Particularly one that is so  imminently well-qualified as Mike Pompeo.  I mean I've been around him a  few times.  He is really on top of his game and it's not surprising that  President Trump selected him for this key billet inside the administration.</p><p>I think he's the star in this administration.  And he's going to prove his  worth very quickly.  Look what he's got in front of him.  He's got the Iran  deal in front of him and he's got a summit coming up between President  Trump and the North Korean leader.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>KEANE:  So his plate -- his plate is going to be full immediately.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's not forget he just came back from North Korea.  He  actually met with Kim Jong-un already.  The White House opened up yesterday  about President Trump's highly-anticipated meeting coming up with Kim Jong- un.  Here's what was said.  Listen to this -- sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, we're not naive in this  process.  We've seen some steps in the right direction but we have a long  way to go.  We also have seen a major change in what has taken place in the  past by having our allies and partners in the region step up and do much  more than they have in the past.</p><p>China has taken a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.   They can certainly do more.  We hope they will and will continue working  with us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  South Korean President Moon Jae-in expected to meet with his  North Korean counterpart this Friday -- General.  What are you expecting?   What are you watching for in this talk over denuclearization?  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In some respects that meeting is as important as the one that  President Trump is going to have.  And here's why.  Moon is really to the  left of center and very pro-North Korean by comparison to his predecessors.   We've had leaders like him before but not quite like him.</p><p>I believe Kim Jong-un, who I think is a very shrewd negotiator and  diplomat, is doing everything he can to manipulate Moon.  I think what will  come out of this is an agreement that the Korean War is over and that the  armistice is also over.</p><p>Now what would be wonderful is that months later, those armies that are  facing each other on the border of North and South Korea pulled away.  That  would really be a positive step in the right direction.  Here's the concern  inside -- some people inside South Korea and inside pour administration. </p><p>That Moon really wants reunification as does Kim Jong-un.  And that at some  point, before all the nuclear weapons go away, Moon -- because the war is  over and we know have a treaty that they've signed will make a  recommendation that we pull the United States troops out of South Korea  which would absolutely be a huge disaster.</p><p>So, there's concern about Moon.  There's no concern about President Trump.   And I don't -- and Kim Jong-un knows his negotiations with President Trump   are going to be very tough.  He knows the president's likely going to be  very unbending on giving up the sanctions before he actually gets something  substantive in terms of denuclearization.  But the Moon - Kim Jong-un  Summit, this is worth very keeping an eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's all pretty extraordinary General, isn't it?  Wow.  Good to  see you sir.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure.  General Jack Keane joining us there.  And  coming up in the program, I'll be speaking with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  about his change of heart on Mike Pompeo later this morning.  Join us at  08:30 a.m. Eastern in about an hour, we will speak with Senator Rand Paul.  </p><p>First of all, coming up next, earnings blitz, six Dow components reporting  earnings before the bell this morning, including United Technologies, the  stock is up almost three percent.

Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday April 24th.   Your top stories right now, 07:30 a.m. East Coast.  Earnings in focus on  Wall Street, six Dow components reporting ahead of the open this morning.   We just heard from Caterpillar beating expectations on both, earnings and  revenue.  The industrial giants also raise its four year outlook.   Caterpillar shares are up almost four percent right now, on earnings of  $2.82 a share, revenue $12.86 billion, again both better than expected.   Stock is up.  3M is down 2.5 percent.  Coca-Cola is up, but Travelers is  down, and United Technologies is up.  We are looking at a rally in the  broader market this morning, as a result of all of this better than  expected earnings.  In fact, right here, this is the high of the morning,  up 160 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average, 2/3 of 1 percent higher.   S&amp;P is also up half a percent and the NASDAQ as well with a 32 point move  right now.  </p><p>This after a mixed day yesterday.  The Dow industrials extended the losing  streak to a fourth session in a row.  The NASDAQ was the worst performer,  it was down a quarter of a percent yesterday.  The Dow was down fraction  but still four days on the losing end.  Checking the global markets this  morning.  European indices are higher.  FT-100 is up almost half a percent,  that's 29 points higher.  CAC Quarante is flat but it's still in positive  territory with a one-point move.  And the DAX Index in Germany, up a third  of a percent, 39 points higher.  In Asia overnight stocks closed mostly  higher.  The Shanghai Composite was the best performer.  It was up just  about two percent in China.  </p><p>Big tech in focus, investors are raising concerns however about Apple.   It's a -- after all a warning of a slowdown in demand for high end  smartphones.  Morgan Stanley taking their estimates down.  We're taking a  closer look ahead of Apple's earnings report on May first.  </p><p>Cooler maker Yeti firing back at the NRA.  Despite cutting ties with the  NRA, Yeti say it fully supports the second amendment. </p><p>And no monkey business when it comes to copyright law.

The hot sauce celebrating its 150th  anniversary with a small batch blend.  It's supposed to be good and it is  hot.  Earning split.</p><p>This morning meanwhile, Caterpillar, Jetblue, 3M, Lockheed Martin all  hitting the tape now.  Joining us now to weigh in is Morgan Creek Capital  Management chief executive officer and chief investment officer, Mark  Yusko.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on earnings so far?  We see some numbers this  morning which are pretty good.  </p><p>YUSKO:  They're pretty good.  And I think, you know, there were very lofty  expectations.  And I think that we can come closer and in some cases exceed  and that's a really good sign.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but we're watching Apple ahead of its results on May  first.  We've been talking a lot with Dan Niles from Alpha One.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Told me over the weekend and he thinks Apple's going to miss.   And then yesterday, a company -- a number of chip makers falling last week,  you know.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leading up to chip manufacturers, smartphones, Taiwan  semiconductor, predicting lower than expected sales for hand-held devices.   And then there's this we've got AMS, which is issuing a forecast echoing  the sentiment, Apple's forecast coming in below estimates, reigniting fears  that consumers are losing their appetite for hand-held devices.  What's  going on around Apple right now?  When you're --</p><p>YUSKO:  Look, I think it's a normal cyclical pause.  You know, that the way  semiconductors work is they boom and then they bust and then they boom and  then they bust.  And I think this Taiwan market really is a microcosm for  that.  You can see it just roared last year, and now it's taking a little  pause.  The component manufacturer's coming into the weaker than  expectations.  Because look, everyone's gone through the upgrade cycle.   They bought their 10.  It's OK.  It's not a world-beating phone.  So, I  think Apple will probably come in a little bit light and will have to  regroup.  But long-term the demand for hand-held is not going away.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Well, I think that what's  getting lost in this narrative is actually removing from hand-helds to in- home devices, virtual assistants, if you think about it, it's supposed to  be over 800 million units by 2020 globally.  I think that's pretty telling  you're seeing it take off in China.  So, I think one of the things when it  comes to the semiconductors is that don't they have a long way to go?  I  mean if you think about the autonomous vehicle, if you start to think about  they're used in mining operation, or digital currencies -- I mean where --</p><p>YUSKO:  Favorite thing to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know the U.S. dollar and euro are digital currencies  considering only eight percent is actually in print.  But where do you see  semiconductors going from here?  Is the cycle still going to continue to go  -- going on?  Because we see Qualcomm getting in a deal.  I mean, there's a  lot of consolidations in the space.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It's a really an important point.  The semiconductor cycle is just  getting started.  You know, today I think there are three microprocessors  per person on the planet.  There are estimates that in the next 30 years  there could be a thousand.  You know, the internet of things is really  coming sometime around 2024, there are these technological waves.  You  know, 1954 the mainframe, 1968 the microchip, 1982 the personal computer,  96 the internet, 2010 the mobile net, 2024 the internet of things, the  internet of value, cryptocurrencies, secure ties, tokens, all of these  things demand semiconductors.  So, I think you make a really good point.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KINGS COLLEGE:  But  Mark, you know, this internet of things, these home devices, I mean they  rely very heavily on the use of data, slicing data.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  What do we know about you -- how do we customize your  experience.  We're seeing a sort of ground swell change in that.  Does that  affect the long-term picture on these kind of devices?  Where in a world  where we assumed, hey, use data however you want, we don't live in that  world anymore.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It absolutely affects how we're going to use that data.  And the  great thing about blockchain technology is it inverts the ownership of the  data.  If you think about internet protocol, Tim Berners-Lee, not a really  wealthy guy, we use TCP/IP every single day.  But the app developers got  all the benefit because we all -- I don't a Facebook account.  But  everybody puts their data out there and Mark and his guys get rich.   Blockchain flips that upside down and the protocol layer can own the value.   So, if you think about what's going to happen, is we're going to have our  data that we use -- I was on a show yesterday with a guy on Shopin, that  they have your profile.  When you go to a site, not only does it fill in  all the data, so you don't have to fill it in and remember your credit card  number, but then it extracts some of the ad revenue back to your account,  paid in crypto.  Awesome idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Let me -- let me ask you, because when we're talking  about these chip companies, Intel and Qualcomm and AMD are reporting this  week.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see the same upset there that we're seeing that  -- with the anticipation about Apple?  </p><p>YUSKO:  You know, I think we might.  You know, one of the things that  people got ahead of themselves in some of the estimates on the chip makers,  particularly AMD and Nvidia because a lot of them were being used for  mining.  For Bitcoin mining and the theory mining and that did take a  little bit of a dip in the first quarter when prices went down.  Now we're  seeing a recovery in those prices, so I think that will be better for  second quarter.  But you think first quarter could be light.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are raising capital right now for a move into crypto with  security tokens.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, so if you think about the three areas, the Jeff's focused on.   There's cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, things that are store value or  eventually going to be a payment system, they're utility tokens, that's all  the craze about ICO's where you actually don't own the company, you own  some utility function -- like this data for Shopin.  Or then there are  security tokens.  If you think of everything of value, this building we're  sitting in, a house or the plaza hotel, everything can be tokenized and we  go from the age of paper ownership, physical securities, to digital owners  -- to electronic ownership, blips on a screen to true digital ownership.   And that trend is massive.  And every year, 14 trillion, with a t, trillion  dollars of real goods transfer ownership.  And that's all going to be  digitized.  So, we want to raise funds to invest or help institutional  investors invest in the security tokens.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Where are you on that?  How much have you raised?  </p><p>YUSKO:  We just announced -- we just announced -- we acquired a team and  we're going to go out, start raising that fund here in the next little bit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are you going to -- are you going to buy bitcoin or are you  going to buy token?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, not crypto, tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>YUSKO:  So, not crypto.  Not utility tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  You've got a big educational job ahead of you I think, to help  people understand --</p><p>YUSKO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- the difference and why -- I mean, this world of privacy  concerns.  This could be a real answer, but people have to get it, right?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, look, cryptocurrency I really do think is the future of money,  so the internet of money.  And if you think about what voice over I.P. or  the internet did for information and commerce, right.  We transfer  everything over internet protocol, this is just transferring money over  internet protocol.  If I want to give you money, I don't need a trusted  third party.  I don't need a bank to tell that we did that.  Once it's on  the chain, it's immutable, it's permanent.  We can do that.  Not good news  for banks.  That's why the banks hate blockchain and bitcoin.  But then you  think about utility tokens, there's a very interesting business there about  having a social network, have a coin that we can use for rewarding you, for  adding data to a social network but security tokens is the big opportunity.   That is true digital ownership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You play -- you still like stocks here or no?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last time you were pretty cautious.  You were saying maybe you  want to sell into some of this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, we were cautious.  And what you've seen since January 26th --  we talked about this, this is distribution.  Every day the last half hour,  the institutional money was selling and selling hard into the close.  And  we've been going down really since January.  The last two days,  interesting, Friday and yesterday, the last half hour there was some  buying.  So I'm cautiously optimistic that maybe the distribution selling  is over and if earnings do come in higher than expected, we could maybe see  a little rally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch that.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks for having me, always fun to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Mark Yusko there.</p><p>Coming up, monkey see, monkey sue.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now this, Yeti is defending its second amendment stance after  an NRA e-mail.  Cheryl Casone with the details now with headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, you know Yeti that make  those coolers -- those drink coolers.  Well their commonly NRA's claim in  accurate.  After an NRA lobbyist sent an e-mail that the company has ceased  doing business with the NRA station.  So, the cooler maker has issued a  statement saying in part \"We were eliminating a group of outdated  discounting programs when we notified the NRA Foundation and the other  organizations about this change.  Yeti explained that we were offeing them  an alternative customization program broadly available to several consumers  and other organization.  So, we'll think about back and forth with those  two.</p><p>Well, an appeals court put an end to the monkey business over this monkey's  selfie.  It's famous.  It was taken back in 2011.  But a legal battle  ensued over if animals can own copyrights.  PETA argued in court that all  profits the photograph makes should belong to Naruto the monkey, since he  held the camera and he did snapped the photo.  Unfortunately for Naruto, he  won't be going on any banana shopping sprees.  The judges upheld the lower  court ruling in favor of yes, the photographer.  Only humans can file  copyright suits.  There you go.</p><p>And (INAUDIBLE), Tabasco is celebrating 150 years in business.  And they've  got a new sauce.  McIlhenny which makes Tabasco is releasing a limited- edition diamond reserve pepper sauce, it comes in a champagne style bottle.   The price is kind of champagne-isk, I guess, $35 for 6-ounces.  Supplies  are limited.  Or maybe a nice bottle of Prosecco .  I can't decide.  I'm  back and forth on this one.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a lot of money for Tabasco, I sort of like it.  </p><p>KELLY:  You like Prosecco, get some Tobasco.  You can have it all Cheryl.   You don't need to choose one or the other.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Can you eat Tabasco?  Out of a bottle that looks like champagne?  </p><p>KELLY:  No, you pour it on.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I know.  But like, it doesn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  it better be good.  </p><p>BRENERG:  I will.  I'm going to get that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am going to get it.  Because they look good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should -- maybe Hillary  Clinton can weigh in.  She's kind of the hot sauce lady.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She carries hot sauce in her purse.  Maybe she can tell us if  it's good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  All right, well take a break.  When we come back,  an American success story, how two brothers turned their Connecticut based  clothing company into a big business.  I'll talk to the founders of  Vineyard Vines coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, at a time that retailers are struggling,  one clothing brand is growing like a vine.  The Connecticut based Vineyard  Vines started in 1998 by two brothers selling ties, now has 95 stores  across the nation.  The brand is also sold in stores like Nordstrom and  Bloomingdales.  Joining me right now are Shep Murray, Vineyard Vines co- founder and CEO and Ian Murray, Vineyard Vines co-founder and CEO.  Good to  see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SHEP MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Thanks, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've been following the company for a lot of years.  And  I've seen how you've grown it.  Talk to us about how you started this and  why you left your desk jobs to go into retail like this?</p><p>S. MURRAY:  Well go.  </p><p>IAN MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Well, sure.  We were  working down the street in Manhattan and we didn't like our jobs.  We were  young.  I was 23, Shep was 27.  And we decided that we could make neckties  to sell to everyone who goes to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket for the  weekend and it comes back to the floor for the stock exchange.  And once  the -- they can't wear t-shirts.  So, they wear the ones that represents  Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How tough was it?  I mean to really -- you had an idea but you  had to put it into practice.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  Yes, I think the idea was to bring the good life to work with  you and in a time when casual workplace was at its height, everyone was  wearing black mock turtlenecks and all that sort of stuffs, the idea was to  bring the good life to work and kind of our company mantra, is every day  should feel this good.  And so, you know, right now, it's all about make  America great again.  We wanted to make clothing fun again.  And so, that's  what we did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I love the symbol of the whale.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  It's pretty fun.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  We grew up, our father actually carved wooden whales over our  doors.  So, that's how we got our logo.  And our customer early on was a  guy who wore Nantucket red shorts and a faded blue polo shirt.  So, that's  how we get the pink and blue color.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I love it.  But I mean, you had to actually get the  funding.  You had to get access to credit.  How easy or tough was that in  terms of creating this business?  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  I mean, well what happened was we had this idea and we were --  I have spent a couple years working on the New York stock exchange.  We  were big followers of you in your past job and Ian was working at a P.R.  Agency.  Then, I went to work for Madison Avenue.  And we were like, we  didn't want our bosses job.  And so, we had nothing to lose by going out on  our own and starting this.  So, 20 years later with a credit card cash  advance of $8,000, we have all these stores and an amazing, amazing team  who help us live every day should feel this good and we still own 100  percent of the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  So, we're celebrating 20 years now.  But we just wrote credit  card checks to ourselves.  We totaled about $7,000 or $8,000.  We bought a  couple hundred ties that we figured out how to make.  And we sold them, we  kept reinvesting the profits in the business and here we are 20 years  later.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's it's incredible.  That is an incredible sport.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, it's crazy.  It's the American dream.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- I mean, it really is the American dream.  But I  mean, in terms of the access to credit, you didn't need it.  You just --  you did it yourself.  You're getting advances on the credit card.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, and over the years, we've been working with a number of  different banks.  We've worked with JP Morgan our lead bank and they've  been fantastic and helping us grow.  And giving us some resources, but we  still have all the equity.  And we've got a little over 100 stores now  throughout the country.  And we work with all sorts of great organizations  that we never thought we'd have the opportunity to work with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the -- is th next move to take it public?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  I don't know about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about an Amazon economy?  Tell me about that.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you've got companies and stores going out of business  left and right because of the Amazon that's going on.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  One of the beauties about being privately held, is we're able  to put the gas on and off when we want.  Amazon is amazing.  We're huge  fans of what Jeff has done.  And you know, we're big Amazon customers.   What we want to do and what we think our customer is looking for is a  better experience.  Amazon's a great marketplace.  But when you go into our  stores and you meet our customers and you get to touch and feel the product  and you see the packaging we provide and all of the other cool lifestyle  stuff that we do, we believe that there's a place for Amazon and brands.   And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, the packaging is a big deal.  How do you grow it  from here?  I mean, you've got these ties that you brought in to show off.   But I see we have a whole rack of dresses and -- I mean, what's the next  step in terms of growth?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.  I mean, I think one of the things we're really having a  lot of fun with is joining our customers, the community that follow  Vineyard Vines with other passions in their life.  We're really excited, we  just announced that we're going to be the official style of the Boston Red  Sox and Fenway Park.  But we're also the official style of the Kentucky  Derby, the America's Cup, we launched a partnership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic, getting into sports.  I love it.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  We just do kind of fun things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Ian, Shep.  Shep, Ian, great to see you both.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  All right, thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations.  Vineyard Vines.

Thank you so much and happy Tuesday everybody.  Good  morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A Blue Chip earnings blitz, six Dow components all due out before the  opening bell this morning including Coca Cola, Verizon, Caterpillar among  others.  Futures this morning looking good, indicating a higher opening for  the broader averages this morning.  We're expecting the Dow Industrials to  be up about 100 points right out of the gate, NASDAQ to be up about 34  points right after the gate this morning.  We are covering the earnings  blitz.</p><p>Alphabet meeting expectations on both profit and revenue last night.   Shares of Google's parent company up three percent in after hours trading  but a spike in expenses temper the initial excitement.  The stock is up  two-thirds of a percent.  Also talking about the company raising its value  in its stake in Uber, that also made the earnings look better than  expected.  Dan Niles predicted what would happen and he was right no  expenses, we're going to talk more about that.  </p><p>Markets closing mostly lower yesterday meanwhile, weighed down by rising  bond yields.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials down 14 points, the S&amp;P was  up a fraction and the NASDAQ down 17.  The Dow down for a fourth session in  a row, that is the longest losing streak since March. </p><p>In Europe this morning, indices look like this, FT-100 is up a third of a  percent, that's 22 points higher.  CAC Quarante is down just a fraction and  the DAX in Germany up 38 points, that is one-third of one percent.  In Asia  overnight, stock closed mostly higher, Shanghai Composite the top performer  up nearly two percent.  </p><p>And then an open book (INAUDIBLE) for the first time, Facebook is revealing  its secret rules for user posts.  Where the company says it crosses the  line.</p><p>Then the Uber of China steps on the gas, the Chinese ride hailing giant  reportedly in talks to go public.  The jaw-dropping valuation for this  company.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney gets jazzed up, the senate hopeful making a scene at  Utah's game against the Thunder.  His hilarious taunt against OKC  Superstar, Russell Westbrook.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The King's College  Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  And Benchmark Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of earnings to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean, this earning season is a pivotal one especially  because everything is really kind of baked in, everybody expects 18 percent  rise on earnings, they expect revenues to be up five percent.  One of the  telling things about earnings season is every sector is suppose to grow and  that hasn't happened since 2014.  So, come to (INAUDIBLE) week of earning  season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure.  Well, I think it's important.  I want to point out  this company AMS, reporting first quarter results.  Now they were OK, the  numbers but the real key here is one of the lines in the press release  says, \"We are seeing a slowdown in sales of smartphones, high-end  smartphones,\" that means AKA Apple.</p><p>So, again, this is -- we're looking at potential slowdown in Apple as Dan  Niles who joined me this weekend on Wall Street said to expect a miss on  Apple.  I wanted to just check AMS because all of the Apple suppliers are  involved in this story and you really see what's to come in terms of the  Apple quarter.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  This is -- I mean, this is so interesting to think this  wave that Apple's been writing for such a long time looks like it's coming  to an end.  This is a company that investors have counted on quarter after  quarter to deliver and now you're looking at their core business, not just  faltering domestically by the way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- this is a global story right now (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  The X10 is not -- just not living up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well people don't want to spend money on it and that's why they  came over to SC editions, you guys remember that?  It was a lower priced  model, they already hit peak sort of luxury sales a couple years ago and  they were always trying to figure out a way how do they get -- get that net  marginal buyer.</p><p>They didn't want to compromise margins, that's something Apple never wants  to do, they want to keep them around 40 percent on the gross margin side.   So, neither they've got to compromise on margins or they've got to  compromised on pricing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned Dan Niles, we said this before the show even  started, Dan Niles got Alphabet, Google right as well in terms of the  expenditures.  There are a lot of -- you see the -- if you look at the  stock this morning for Google, I'm just going to call it Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the symbol is still Goo -- it's still Google.  But,  again, the concern there that will hold back this stock is what are the  regulations going to be on this business?  They don't want to tout their ad  revenue growth a little too much.  By the way, it was up 24 percent, $26.6  billion, that's almost double what Facebook is believed to have generated  an ad revenue for the same period.  </p><p>But they're not going to champion it because, again, there are a lot of  questions that we talk about on his show yesterday of how much of their  data are they abusing?  And how far are they going and continue to generate  this ad revenue?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big story.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big story.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, it's so interesting to watch it because the numbers here  were good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, overall they were very good and yet the market reaction  was, \"Uh, we don't know about the future.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They increased the valuation though of their ownership's stake  in Uber and that also made the numbers look stronger again.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But even backing that out is a good result, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The second quarter I should say.  But the expenses are an  issue, there are some news in there.  So we've got a big show this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman, Texas Congressman Kevin Brady in the studio this  morning.  Foreign Relations Committee Member, Kentucky Senator, Rand Paul  is with us after changing his vote last night and voting for Mike Pompeo.   Former Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee is with us along with former  Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter.  </p><p>Former Hillary Clinton Director of Strategic Communications and Elrod  Strategist President, Adrienne Elrod is here.  And FOX News Senior  Strategic Analyst, Retired General, Four Star General, Jack Keane.  Don't  miss a moment of it, we got a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with a look at Futures, we are expecting a  higher opening for the broader averages.  We're looking at a rally at the  start of trading.  Investors are waiting first quarter results from six Dow  components this morning and if noted a moment ago, we are looking at  overall S&amp;P500 growth in profit of about 19 percent for the first quarter.   That is the estimate.</p><p>United Technologies, Coca Cola, Travelers, Verizon, Caterpillar, and 3M all  reporting before the opening of trading this morning Brian.  This is going  to be a big day.  Obviously, that's going to weigh on markets or influence  markets.  Right now, we're expecting a rally f a hundred.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well -- I mean, it should and it's good to see the market up.  I  mean these numbers have been extraordinarily this quarter.  These are --  what we're talking about decades since we've seen this kind of beat  numbers, companies reported as well and yet markets have been back and  forth.</p><p>It's good to see them up a hundred year because the fundamentals  underlying, those are good.  The problem this week is tech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Tech is such a question mark and I think that's going to rattle  investors just a little bit.  To Dagen's point, because we don't know this  Alphabet question, what's happening in the future without these  regulations?</p><p>KELLY:  Well they do.  Yes, you know the question in a month from now, the  European regulators are going to come in and they're going to implement  their protection rules and it's, what are the U.S. regulators going to do  behind it?  Google --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Google had said we're -- we've been -- 18 months we've been  reading.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they've been doing it for 18 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they beat the numbers, the technology giant, Google's parent  Alphabet, they beat the numbers yesterday, they reported earnings of $13.33  a share on revenue of $31.5 billion in revenue.</p><p>Here's what Alpha One Capital Partners Dan Niles accurately predicted would  be the big issue ahead of this report.  Listen to this, hear what he's  saying last week on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  The problem with  Google is the exact opposite as with Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided  expenses up 45 to 60 percent this year before this data breach stuff ever  happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't (INAUDIBLE) but Wall Street has expenses  modeled so that -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I  think the expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  There you go.  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been -- let me -- so they spent a record $7.3 billion in  the first-quarter, nearly triple what the company spent a year ago, triple.   Now some of that, almost $2.5 billion of that was buying the Chelsea Market  here in New York City but they added 5,000 employees including 2,000 that's  -- that came from the purchase of HTC's mobile, a handset design operation.</p><p>But, again, it -- if this is going to be a headwind for the company,  regulation, how much more ad revenue can they continue to squeeze out of  people now who are concerned about their privacy and the expenditure.</p><p>KELLY:  Well just real quick on what Dan is saying, Dan hit the nail on the  head and one of the reasons you can tell is because traffic acquisition  cost were up 36 percent and last quarter, Google actually said it was going  to be down.  </p><p>So that's why the stock sold off initially when they released earnings.   And now it's up in the premarket because the Asian markets are up.  So it's  not actually off of their own earnings --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>KELLY:  -- it's because general market sentiment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, the stock wasn't even up this year.  It was up  barely two percent.  It was trading in a pretty reasonable valuation for  tech.</p><p>KELLY:  Well one of the reasons why they spent so much money on that  Chelsea Market, over $2 billion is because their biggest competitor in the  advertising space, Amazon bought another building in midtown and they're  going to be leading the way in the advertising revolution, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well look, I mean the stock is obviously going to be big  volume today as well.  Then there's Facebook opening up about the secret  guidelines today on how they actually police content while introducing a  new appeals process for users who are found in violation of Facebook's  \"standards.\"  </p><p>The Silicon Valley titan is also revealing and increase the number of  content reviewers by 40 percent year-over-year, Dagen, what do you think  about this one?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could sum up some of their policies in a couple sentences, if  you're prolife and pro second amendment, your content gets banned on  Facebook.  I've had friends that experience that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is horrible.  That is exactly the things that Congress is  zeroing in on.  You cannot control what the rest of us see and what we  don't see and that's what some of these companies are doing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they're about community, whether they're about building a  community as long as you agree with what the people running the company  believe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not right.  It's not right at all.  And let me tell you,  that is going to be a big issue for this company in terms of regulators.</p><p>We want to turn now to the deadly van attack in Toronto, Canada where 10  people are now dead.

So this includes the IR15 that was used in the Waffle House  shooting, separate gun, separate incident.  But remember, the shooting  rampage was eventually stopped by hero customer James Shaw, Jr.  </p><p>He appeared on Fox and Friends first this morning.  Not only is Shaw a  hero, he started a Go Fund Me page to raise money for the victim's  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  I just want to give them a small  gesture.

TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS -- road we're in and need a strong Secretary of  State in place and so the democrats don't play politics with national  security appointments but instead confirm Mike Pompeo to this position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz with me yesterday  throwing his support behind President Trump's nominee for Secretary of  State, Mike Pompeo in an interview on Fox News about 4:00 yesterday.</p><p>Pompeo advanced yesterday with a favorable recommendation from the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee after republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  changed his mind and his vote.  Joining us now and talk more about that is  former Presidential Candidate himself, former republican Arkansas Governor,  Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you sir.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.   Great to be with you today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised with what took place last night?  Basically  Rand Paul saying, \"Look, I had a conversation with the president, I believe  now that Mike Pompeo agrees with the president and with me to lessen the  entitlement across the world, what's your take?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well a couple of things, first of all, Rand Paul is a principle  guy, there were some things he was uncomfortable with until he come around.   The second thing about it is when he's on your show later today.  Notice  that he is -- his arm is in a cast, Donald Trump broke it twisting  yesterday.</p><p>But the point is Mike Pompeo is going to be confirmed as Secretary of  State.  He should have made this just sliding through this is an absurdity.   If the democrats want to pick some fights, this was a dumb on the pick.   Take a look at after somebody who has his pedigree, his experience, and  frankly already having sat down with North Korea and stands in a position  to do some extraordinary things.  They shouldn't fight everything because  then nothing they do has any credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's not forget what he just did, he just went all the  way to North Korea and met with Kim Jong-un.  It's a good point and I'm  glad you brought it up, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out,  they call out Jeff Merkley, the democrat from Oregon saying that a vote for  Mike Pompeo is a vote for Trump's war cabinet.</p><p>Well guess what, Mike Pompeo is nominated to be the chief diplomat.  So  what -- how do you fight potential war with diplomacy?  So I think that  some of these senators need to go back to school a little bit on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was a very important symbolic moment for the republicans.   You did not want to be where the republicans still in control of the  Senate, the republicans having the majority on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, 11 to 10 to be the first time since at least 1925 that the  Secretary of State nominee didn't get a favorable vote coming out of the  Senate Foreign Relations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would have been a slap in the face of American people who  voted for these republican senators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially with what's going on right now.  You know  Governor, my favorite line from Lindsey Graham yesterday was, \"You might be  sick of fighting with these extremists but guess what, they're not tired of  fighting with you.\"  And so this is the reality that we face.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Lindsey Graham said yesterday.  Another is, \"We've  got to keep this up and we've got to keep the troops in Syria over the  near-term because they're not tired of fighting with us.\"</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There are a lot of republicans who are not that fund of Donald  Trump and I get that but they've got to remember that under the  constitution, when he's elected president, he has every right to pick his  own cabinet and staff.  And unless they can find something morally  objectionable or outrageously unacceptable, they should give the president  the people that he wants to be in his cabinet.</p><p>The republicans did that for John Kerry, for Hillary Clinton, I doubt that  a lot of who voted 94 by the way votes in the Senate on both Kerry and  Clinton, I'm sure there were a lot of republicans who held their nose and  did it.  But they looked at the constitution and they said, \"Whether we  like it or not, Obama's president, he has a right to pick his Secretary of  State.\"  I just don't understand who these democrats look into a camera  which they love to do but look into a camera and explain, \"Oh Mike Pompeo,  I can't vote for him because he has views about same sex marriage or maybe  views about abortion\" which has nothing to do with being Secretary of  State.  That's an absurdity and I think they had embarrassed themselves.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are three democrat senators who come out and said that  they will vote in favor of Mike Pompeo to be the Secretary of State.  And  correct me if I'm wrong, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Mansion in West Virginia, and  then Joe Donnelly, so those are the three so far.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's correct.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But Governor, you do have at least four who voted to confirm him  as director of CIA who said they will not vote for him for this position.   And I think you hit it exactly right, they're talking about issues that  have nothing to do with foreign policy, the job of a Secretary of State.   How do you defend the critique of Pompeo on those grounds when that had  nothing to do with his job?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, again, it's just a stretch.  They don't have anything, so  they make something up.  They'd be better off bringing James Taylor into  the Senate Chamber and let him sing, \"You've Got a Friend\" and I'll have a  big bear hug. </p><p>That would make a lot more sense in what they're doing.  I think they're  hurting themselves for the midterms but as somebody who hopes republicans  hangs on to both Houses, I can only hope that they continue to act this  foolishly when it comes to the president's appointments especially in light  of the fact that he's got this extraordinary relationship with the  president of France whose got North Korea coming to the table.  Those are  some pretty big things happening right now on the national security front.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, really big things actually.  Well let me turn to border  security Governor, a caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants  arriving at the U.S. border, the pictures are incredible.</p><p>President Trump tweeted on the matter yesterday, here's what he wrote,  \"Despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border  being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland  Security not to let these large caravans of people into our country.  It is  a disgrace.  We are the only country in the world so na[ve.  Wall.\"</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen issued a statement reinforcing  U.S. immigration law.  She said, \"If you enter the United States illegally,  let me be clear, you have broken the law and we will enforce the law  through prosecution of illegal border crosser.\"  Governor, your take on  this.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's no doubt that one of the reasons, one of the big reasons  Donald Trump is sitting in the White House today is because of his position  on immigration.  It's not that Americans are anti-immigrant but their --  but what they are is they're anti-breaking the law and getting away with it  and they're tired of it.</p><p>And what they want is if there are people who legitimately need asylum,  Americans have big hearts, they're -- they understand but they're not  willing to just open the gates and say, \"Come on in everybody, we've got  benefits including welfare and medical care\" that's just not where this  country is right now and it frankly shouldn't be.  We have no idea who the  people are in those caravans, so they've got to be vetted, they've got to  be carefully screened and that's what president is asking for but it's got  the American people demand.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Governor, do you think we'll get anything done when it comes  to immigration policy this year, vis-a-vis DACA or any other plans?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We could if the democrats really believed in it but they don't  and they've shown they don't.  The president laid more on the table than I  ever thought h would lay on the table more than any republican ever wanted  to lay on the table.  </p><p>But he did it basically I think to say, \"We're not against immigration  reform, we're just wanting to do it in a context of law.\"  Now the  democrats walked away from going this point of saying, \"This is the most  important thing we have to deal with and the deadline is looming to, \"Oh,  never mind.\"  I'm just amazed that they can do this with such a (INAUDIBLE)  just indifference to the causes they claimed to champion, they really don't  stand for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Governor, good to see you  sir, thanks so much for weighing in.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Good to talk to you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee joining us there.  We'll take a break.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th, your  top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are looking to  rebound, take a look, Futures indicating a rally right at the start of  trading, up 140 points on the Dow, 15 on S&amp;P, and 48 points higher on the  NASDAQ, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Driving the sentiment earnings, once again, it is the busiest week for  earnings season, this week.  Today, alone, six Dow Components will report  their first-quarter.  Among the names to watch, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and  Verizon, may very well mean market movers.  This after a mixed day  yesterday, the Dow extended its losing streak to a fourth session.  The  technology heavy, NASDAQ, the worst performer, down a quarter of a percent  yesterday, 17 points lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check the action in Europe, FT-100 is up 25, a  third of a percent, CAC Quarante is flat on the session in Paris, and the  DAX Index in Germany, up one third of a percent, 50 points higher.

Plus, another Chinese giants looking to make its way on Wall  Street, the Wall Street Journal reporting the country's top rival to Uber,  is eyeing an IPO with an eye-popping valuation.  Data concerns now hitting  match.com, a glitch reactivates old accounts.  We've got the details on the  impact.  </p><p>And then, Mitt Romney, from senate candidate to top Hitler, his talks  against Russell Westbrook, going viral, all that, coming up this Tuesday  morning but first, lawmakers are speaking out this morning over the Special  Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.  Yesterday, Senator Ted Cruz  outlined his concerns about the investigation, when I spoke with him on Fox  News, in the afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRUZ:  The Department of Justice, the Special Counsel, should not become a  partisan fishing expedition.  Listen, I think it's very troubling that Bob  Mueller has appointed a number of lawyers to his team, who are partisan  Democrats, who repeatedly been Democratic donors.  In my view, the  Department of Justice and the FBI, that they should be beyond reproach,  they have a long bipartisan tradition of staying out of politics and when  you see partisan text back and forth, when you see partisan Democratic  donors in a grill in the investigation, that rises very serious questions  about fairness and impartiality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the Former Director of Strategic  Communications for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and President of  Elrod Strategies, Adrienne Elrod, along with Former Special Assistant to  President Trump and Former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc  Lotter.  Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Good  morning.</p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, PRESIDENT, ELROD STRATEGIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, let me ask you, what do you think of when you -- what  do you say when you hear all about this bias at the top of the FBI, the  bias at the top of the Department of Justice during the presidential  election where they were very favorable toward Hillary Clinton and,  basically, created this narrative against Donald Trump.  What's your take  on it?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I won't exactly say that they were favorable toward Hillary  Clinton because I strongly believe it.  Comey, reopening the investigation  12 days before the campaign is why we lost, the primary reason why we lost.   But, look, I think these comments by Senator Cruz are disturbing and yet  another example of Republicans trying to undermine the credibility of  Robert Mueller in the investigation.  That's exactly why we need this  bipartisan bill that Democrats and Republicans are pushing in congress,  allowed to come to the floor, so that Bob Mueller will be protected from  being fired by Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, but, Adrienne, actually, when you look at what took  place, Jim Comey wrote an exoneration letter for Hillary Clinton even  before he did the interview.  When she did the interview with the FBI, it  wasn't recorded, it wasn't on the record, we saw all the texts from Peter  Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page, where they wanted an insurance policy  and now we know from the Chairman of the Intel Committee that, in fact,  there was no official intelligence used to launch an attack on Donald Trump  and an investigation on Donald Trump  So to me, it looks like the collusion  was with Hillary Clinton and the FBI, actually.</p><p>ELROD:  No.  I completely and respectfully disagree, Maria.  Let's also  remember that Strzok and Page were both immediately removed from this  committee when --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they still work there.  They actually still work at the FBI  and they have security clearances, still.  They still are there.</p><p>ELROD:  By the Special Counsel.  They were removed from being a part of the  investigation and the Special Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc Lotter, how do you see it?</p><p>LOTTER:  I agree with you, Maria, I mean, there are some very disturbing  things that have taken place by a very small handful of people at the top  of the FBI and the Justice Department and the former administration, but  those things are being looked at right now by the inspector general.   There's been a criminal referral possibly involving former Deputy Director  of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, for the way he was conducting himself during  that time period.  </p><p>So, there are very serious concerns.  But once again, the White House has  said over and over and over again, including yesterday.  There has been no  discussion about firing Director Mueller and that's why Senator McConnell  is saying that this bill that protects him is just nothing more than a  political sham like their lawsuit from the Democratic National Committee,  just trying to keep the Russian narrative alive when there is absolutely no  there, there.</p><p>KELLY:  Hey, Adrienne, it's Kevin Kelly, one of the questions I have is do  you think Democrats are going to, sort of, keep this narrative up through  the election and then hopefully, when the 2018 elections are over, everyone  will, sort of, move on and hopefully, Mueller will, kind of, wind down his  investigation or do you see it ramping up and then dogging the Trump  presidency for the remaining few years?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I think the Democrats, look, going into 2018 and beyond, I  mean, it's kind of irrelevant from the actual midterm.  Doing everything we  can to protect the Mueller investigation.  It is incredibly important that  Robert Mueller be able to carry on his investigation with integrity,  without any, sort of, undue influence from the administration.  I think  that's what we're focused on doing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is a -- that is a bill  or a cockamamie idea cooked up because people hate Trump, about this bill  to prevent him from furrowing Bob Mueller.  In fact, if you look at it,  it's unconstitutional.  It takes the power of the executive branch and  tries to hand it to somebody else or another part of the government.   Antonin Scalia will be screaming to the high heavens where he is right now,  if he was still on planet earth about this.  And that is why Mitch  McConnell has said he's not -- he' not going to touch it, essentially, that  he is not going to bring the bill up for a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, you got two GOP chairman striking a deal with the  Department of Justice for documents tied to the FBI investigation and to  Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.  The joint statement from  Congressman Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy, reads in part this, we look  forward to reviewing the information to better understand the decisions  made by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017.  Congress has a  constitutional responsibility to preserve the integrity of our justice  system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken.   Adrienne, how do you see that?</p><p>ELROD:  I mean, I see this is -- you know, why are we spending time on this  anymore, I mean, the case closed situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's obstruction, because it's obstruction of justice.</p><p>ELROD:  It was closed -- it was closed before the campaign, it was closed  before the midterms.  You know, look, if Goodlatte and Gowdy want to focus  their time on this, fine.  But I frankly think it is a waste of their time.   I think it's a waste of taxpayer dollars and I think it's a waste of the  Department of Justice's time to produce these documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let me ask you this, I mean, were you there when the DNC  got hacked?</p><p>ELROD:  I was.  I was on Hillary Clinton's campaign when this happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what was the answer for her not giving the servers to the  FBI?  Why would she not give the server?  I mean, you're the DNC, you get  hacked, all your e-mails are out there in the public view.  Why wouldn't  you want the strength and the power and the might of the FBI to figure out  exactly who hacked you and what went on?  Why not give up servers?  And why  hire private company so that the servers are kept away from the FBI? </p><p>ELROD:  Well, look, I think, she has a lot of reasons for not turning over  the servers to the FBI --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the reason?</p><p>ELROD:  She produced all the e-mails that were asked and those e-mails were  investigated and it was determined by the FBI, and by the Department of  Justice to Hillary Clinton, I did not do anything wrong and she apologized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>ELROD:  But again -- but again, this was in -- this was in 2016, case  closed.  I think there's another way for Republicans to continue to try to  distract from the problems that they are facing at the party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, actually, it was the Democrats that are distracted,  Adrienne, let's be clear.  They didn't give up the server after they were  hacked, and instead, they brought in a private company to investigate the  server rather than giving it to the FBI.  That's where the obstruction lies  right now and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier along with the DNC which  was used to wiretap a member of Donald Trump's team.  That, we know for a  fact, Adrienne.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, we also admit there's a lot of information on the dossier  that has been independently corroborated by the FBI and the Special  Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Actually, it's unverified.  This was all unverified in the  dossier.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, again, let's let the Mueller investigation play out.  Let's  let it play out, Maria, let's let it play out.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Marc, if you want the Mueller investigation to play out,  shouldn't you also want this investigation to play out?  I mean, why so  much concern about one happening and the other closing up quickly, don't we  need both?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I mean, it's typical, I mean, Democrats want a double  standard, they don't want to go back and look at the things they did with  their collusion with the fact that, Loretta Lynch, according to Jim Comey's  book, may have been compromised and that's why he took the steps that he  took in the -- in the entire situation.  There's a lot of information that  needs to be uncovered here, and, I think, that's where we're going to see  congress continue to look into it.  </p><p>The Inspector General is still looking into the actions that took place at  the FBI, at the Department of Justice.  And we just need to get all of this  information out in public and get it behind us.  We've got too many good  things going on in this country from an economic standpoint, to the way of  our standing on the world stage over the leadership of President Trump.  We  don't need to be going back and always rehashing this.  Let's talk about  the great things that are happening right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is this agreement that Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte  have engineered with the Justice Department, Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, it sounds to me that they're going to go back and get a lot  of the documents that have not been turned over yet, as it may relate to  communications and other documents during that time period.  And so, since  they are investigatory documents, sometimes, obviously, there are some  issues there, there may be some classifications, but it's great that  they're -- that they're working with the Department of Justice.  We're  going to put the politics behind us on this.  And let's just get the  information out there, let the American people decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Adrienne Elrod, Marc  Lotter, good to see you both.  Thank you very much --</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>ELROD:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  for weighing in on all of this.  By the way, the President has  said (INAUDIBLE) he's not going to fire Robert Mueller.  So I don't know  why, you know, this question keeps coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the, media, every time that he is near a microphone,  people are shouting the question at him, are you going to fire Bob Mueller?   Are you going to fire Bob Mueller?  So this is an idea, looking at it from  my perspective, they are goading him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It says if members of the media are goading him to fire Bob  Mueller.  And it's -- you know what it had?  It's a narrative that's  basically concocted by people --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Muddy the waters.  Keep money in the waters.  All right, coming  up, China's largest ride-hailing company, reportedly revving up its IPO  plans, the jaw-dropping valuation for the company, coming up.  And then  Krispy Kreme celebrates spring with a limited-edition donut, but you have  to act fast for this tasty treat.  Plus, two big interviews, coming up,  Senator Rand Paul and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady,  join me later on in the program.  Back in a moment, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news overnight, a major Chinese ride  hailing company reportedly gears up for a multibillion-dollar IPO.  Cheryl  Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Multi-billion, Maria.  Get this, the Wall Street Journal says the  DiDi Chuxing is in talks with bankers about going public; possible  valuation up to $80 billion.  The offering could happen as soon as this  year, and that cash will be used for DiDi to expand internationally.  If  this company went public, DiDi would beat rival Uber to the public markets.  </p><p>Privacy concerns hitting Match.com users after a glitch re-activated some  old accounts.  And while the company maintained, it was a limited number of  accounts, their current privacy statements says that the company can retain  certain information associated with your account even after you close it,  even if you get married, have children, there you go.  Old accounts are  reactivated if you see a password reset e-mail for Match, you don't have an  account any more there were go.  Match landed in 1995, they're now  available in 25 countries.  Shares of match grew; actually, up about 50  percent so far this year.  </p><p>OK, Maria, you may remember we reported on this, there was a big contest to  name the next Krispy Kreme donut flavor.  A lot of strong opinion on set  that day.  Two million votes came in and the winner is lemon glaze.  Lemon  beat out blueberry, caramel, and maple.  I know -- I wanted maple.  The new  donut goes on sale today; only for a week -- whatever, Krispy Kreme.  It's  only available through Sunday.  I forgot who wanted lemon.  I was voting  for maple, but there was a lot of back and forth on that one.    BARTIROMO:  You wanted lemon.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Lemon is the rightful winner here.  There's nothing better on a  donut than lemon glaze.  </p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Way better than maple.</p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon, talk about Uber, they can't even get their IPO  out, their valuations gone to $46 billion.  The Chinese company, they had  to cede control too in China.  Now, valued at 80 billion, can you believe  it?  That's a lemon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will Uber ever go public.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes, yes.  Their CEO has re-affirmed that they are going to go  public in 2019.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got my head on my hands because some the mornings, you just  want to talk about donuts, Kevin.  Some morning --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All business all the time.  That's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, he's our younger brother.  And I just have to  bust your job.  I can't help it.  You're my younger brother too.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  The donut eating and talking younger brother.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You understand the importance of talking about it?</p><p>BRENBERG:  Priorities in life.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but I'm just upset we didn't get maple, that's why, so I had  to pivot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think I'm with you on the maple, by the way.  Coming up,  Mitt Romney's ribbing -- did you see it?  Former presidential candidate  getting into playoff fever last night with courtside tots during the Utah  Jazz playoff game.  And forget sports drinks and shoe endorsements, Steph  Curry has just landed a major entertainment deal.  Sports is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In the NBA Playoffs, the Houston Rockets are  soaring to new heights.  Jared Max with all the details.  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Houston,  Minnesota has a problem.  James Harden pumped the Rocket fuel in the second  quarter like the team have never seen.  Game three Rockets-Timberwolves.   Houston up two games to one.  Harden scores 22 points in the second  quarter, 22 of the Rockets, 50.  One point off the NBA record set 56 years  ago.  For the most points in the playoff quarter, Harden finish with 36,  Rockets win by 19.  They only need one more win to advance Team Wolves  free,  </p><p>Game four in Salt Lake City, between the Jazz and Thunder running for  Senate in Utah.  Former presidential candidate, Massachusetts Governor Mitt  Romney taunting, talking trash to OKC star, Russell Westbrook.  He keeps  holding up his fingers that there's four -- four fouls.  Eventually,  Russell Westbrook gets his fifth foul and the Jazz win by 17.  Donovan  Mitchell's scored 33.  Utah leads three games to one.  </p><p>Veteran Bay Area T.V. sport anchor and one-time 49ers Receiver Mike Shumann  of KGO T.V. in San Francisco allegedly was caught on video last week in San  Antonio appearing to steal a jacket that belonged to the Golden State  Warriors Head of Security, Ralph Walker.  KGO investigating Shumann,  reportedly sent home from NBA Playoff coverage.  </p><p>Move over Lebron James.  You're not the only NBA superstar making waves in  the entertainment world.  Warriors' great Stephen Curry has chosen Sony  Entertainment Pictures after cording with several industry giants to sign  what is described as a wide-ranging multi-year deal, unanimous media --  that's the company that Steph created recently.  Film, television,  electronics gaming, virtual reality, it's all there for Steph whose  production lot will be in Culver City at Sony Pictures -- life after  basketball.  </p><p>On one side, we have Rob Gronkowski, the New England Patriots Tight End.   And on the other, Rob Gronkowski, just Gronkowski, the 3-year-old cult,  named for the Patriots' tight end.  Rob Gronkowski, the player, recently  bought minority stake in the stakes horse, Gronkowski, who is set to run in  next month's Kentucky Derby.  But, Gronkowski, the horse, had a spike and  fever last weekend, and Gronkowski is not going to be running the Kentucky  Derby, and that's going to be May 5th at Churchill Downs.  Rob Gronkowski,  the person, expressing his lament.  Well, I want to know who gets back on  the field first: Rob Gronkowski the player or Rob Gronkowski the horse?  </p><p>KELLY:  I think Rob Gronkowski should run the Kentucky Derby, he's the true  beast.  I bet he could outrun that horse.  </p><p>MAX:  He said he wanted to get on that horse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, he did?</p><p>MAX:  And that was scary right of at that.</p><p>KELLY:  Would he do it shirtless?  </p><p>MAX:  I don't know what he'd do, but he's got a four time the body mass of  a jockey so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, how about this: racing champ, Matt Kenseth, to make a  return to NASCAR, Dagen.  Big news for NASCAR.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's kind of an exclamation point on what's been going on in the  sport.  Matt Kenseth is returning.  He's going to part-time drive for Roush  Racing this -- the rest of this year.  He's spent about a dozen years  racing for Roush, that's where he was when he won his only cup championship  that was back 2003 before the current playoff series was introduced.  Then,  he raced for Joe Gibbs racing.  Joe Gibbs racing replaced him with the  younger cheaper driver, which is a testament to what's happening in the  sport, is they want young blood.  Again, it's not just the ladies who get  cast aside when they get a little bit older, it's the men the too.  They  want young blood because they think millennials, that will attract to  advertising dollars and they're a lot cheaper.  So, they're trying to get  the salaries down on these drives and attract ads -- attract ad dollars.   Matt Kenseth, luckily, is getting back -- </p><p>KELLY:  Is part-time driving, is that a wave of the future?  I've never  heard really, kind of, part-time. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe, I highly doubt it, because it makes it very hard for  somebody to race, somebody who's only in the car part of the time.  And I  think that would impossible for you to -- if you're only racing part-time,  impossible to win a championship.   </p><p>BRENBERG:  Kevin, I don't think you can get into it.  </p><p>KELLY:  OK.  I've got a day job.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that was it.  That was the first sexist comment I've made.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I said it, so.</p><p>MAX:  Hey, how about -- Jenny Cavnar last time, very cool calls of baseball  game, play-by-play for the Colorado Rockies' first woman, who 25 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was cool.  </p><p>MAX:  Cool stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Catch Jared's sports report Fox News  Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, full steam ahead for phase  two of tax reform.  Kevin Brady in the studio, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, April 24th, your  top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast, a blue chip earnings blitz today.  Six Dow components all  reporting their first-quarter earnings before the opening bell.   Caterpillar leader the way beating expectations on both profit and revenue  while also raising full year guidance.  The stock is up.  The strong  results looking to Dow futures indicating a pretty good rally at the start  of trading this morning.  This is right around the high of the morning up  150 points on the Dow two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds  of a percent as does the NASDAQ for the gain of 38 points right now.   Alphabet beating expectations on both profit and revenue last night, but  the company is raising concerns about expenses as we expected.  The stock  is down this morning, one half of one percent in the premarket. </p><p>Newer markets closed mostly lower yesterday weighed down by yields --  rising bond yields as the 10 year crept closer to three percent.  The DowIndustrials were down 14 points, fractional move on a percentage basis.   S&amp;P was up a fraction and the NASDAQ was down about a quarter of a percent,  17 points.  The Dow was down for a fourth day in a row.  That was the  longest losing streak since March.  In Europe this morning, the indices  look like with the FT-100 showing a gain of 25.  The CAC Quarante is up  fractionally and the DAX Index is up 28 points.  That's a quarter of a  percent higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks closing mostly higher with the  exception of Korea.  Best performer was Shanghai in China the top performer  up at two percent on the session.  In open book for the first time,  Facebook is revealing its secret rules for user posts where the company  says crosses the line.  And then a change of heart, Kentucky Senator Rand  Paul reversed his stance and cleared the way for President Trump's  Secretary of State nominee, Mike Pompeo. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  I've been  opposed to this nomination for a long time.  I hope that they'll let Trump  be Trump and that Pompeo will be a constructive influences and not a  destructive one.  But from what I've been told and listened to with  director I think that he is open and understands that his job is -- that  the president is his boss. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator Rand Paul coming up about  his Pompeo decision.  Join us at 8:30 this morning in about 30 minutes for  that special interview.  And then cashing in on the crypto craze, the  details as Goldman Sachs makes its first hire for the cryptocurrency  market.  All those stories coming up Tuesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, The King's College  Business Economics Professor Brian Brenberg, and Benchmark Managing Partner  Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes.  It's great to be here  especially during earnings week. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A third of the S&amp;P reporting earnings this week.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  And  having a little effect today.  The Dow is up.  There are some good news  coming already this morning.  Maybe CAC won't dominate the week.  Maybe  some of these bread and butter companies in the economy will dominate the - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you got Amazon coming out on Thursday.  You got Qualcomm  and Intel coming out tomorrow and Thursday. </p><p>KELLY:  And Pulte actually reported this morning and the home builders are  doing exceptionally well.  They've consistently beat.  There were worries  about, you know, with rising interest rates how that's going to affect.   But we have a limited supply of housing in the United States here.  It's a  big over hang and that's why you're seeing the rental markets still do well  in face of that. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  With home building and  construction they'll watch for rising import costs, watch for rising  inflation.  There were a bunch of stories being passed around last week  about condo developers killing projects and say Toronto because of the  rising material costs, and that was one of the things that fueled the move  out of treasury bonds here I think.  And, again, I think that if you -- if  you top 30 percent yield on 10 year could be very, very rough going through  the stock market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, I don't know why though.  I mean -- OK.  So it's  three percent but you're still talking about rock bottom numbers.  I mean  why would so afraid three percent. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- worrying about the Federal Reserve overreacting to inflation  concerns and they start worrying about you hit three, you start worrying  about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  It's a bigger percentage move to go from two percent to three  percent then three percent to four percent.  It's actually -- and in an  economy that's going to have over three percent GDP growth this year, you  look at the nominal grow -- I mean it's unbelievable. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's unprecedented unwinding of unprecedented stimulus  from our central bank and I don't think anybody knows how that's going to  end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many people have come on this program and said to us the  biggest risk to economic growth right now is the Federal Reserve?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We talked about it in last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big conversation this morning about all of the above.  Joining  the conversation Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul is with me today.  I will get his take on his last minute  reversal to vote in favor of Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State, the  budget, and a lot more.  Don't miss that special interview coming up.  But  first is our top story is earnings in focus, six Dow companies are  reporting earnings this morning including Travelers, 3M, Coca-Cola.  They  had mixed reports overall.  But United Technologies, Caterpillar, and  Verizon all beat on earnings and revenue for the first quarter and all of  those stocks are trading higher.  Caterpillar was one that was really  closely watched because that is a big indicator of global economic  activity.  Futures right now indicating a big gain at the start of trading.   Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points right out of the gate, two- thirds of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up half a percent right now, 35  points higher.  And joining us right now to talk more about all that is The  Gartman Letter Editor and Publisher Dennis Gartman.  Dennis, good to see  you sir.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE GARTMAN LETTER:  Always honored  to be on.  Thanks for asking me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get to the fundamentals if you will in terms of  earnings, let's talk technical because I know you like to look at the  charts.  What do the charts tell you right now, Dennis, in terms of where  we are in the stock market rally?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think it's -- it bothers me greatly that we have seen the  highs.  I'm quite convince in both the market here in the United States and  globally, so I'm actually in the long-term quite bearish of equities, I  think that we've got the monetary authorities here in the United States  already erring upon the side of tighter monetary policy.  We've seen the  adjusted monetary based on about 10 percent from its highs.  That's not  going to change anytime soon.  We're allowing the monetary base to roll  off.  We're probably going to see the ECB begin to tighten.  The only bank  of consequence that won't be tightening the monetary policy anytime soon is  the Bank of Japan and as long as the monetary authority is on balance are  beginning that process they're taking away the liquidity that has sponsored  the Bull market.  So technically, I'm actually quite bearish.  In the short  run, we got so terribly oversold two weeks ago that we're having a good  bounce.  We shouldn't be surprised by this, but if we took the Dow up  another 150 to 200, I guarantee you I shall be selling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget though that there's this narrative right now  that things aren't going to slow down.  Dagen, they've got this massive  balance to walk the Federal Reserve does.  Even Robert Kaplan from the  Dallas Federal Reserve last week said, he wants this two more rate hikes a  total of three for this year because while he's expecting 2.6 percent or  2.7 percent growth this year, he thinks growth plummets down to one and  three-quarters percent by the end of '19, so there's this narrative that  things are going to start slowing down in a big way. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's something -- that echoes how Stephanie Pomboy has  felt about this economy.  But to -- what we're talking about the Federal  Reserve winding down that balance sheet, that's -- they've laid out a plan  to do that.  And it would require something really extreme and dramatic in  the economy for them to change course at this point on that note.  And I  don't think people really understand what this economy looks like with the  markets look like without all of that buying by Federal Reserve, and one  thing I would just point out and it's to kind of pivot a little bit but  watch these NAFTA negotiations to sort of going on.  They resumed today  behind closed doors with Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative,  representatives from Canada and that's -- they're trying to do something by  the end of next week.  President Trump is threatening to change it or pull  out of it on his own, can he do it?  There's a lot of pushback in Congress.   Again, Europe and Mexico have just inked a trade deal.  We're getting left  behind and this could roil markets.  I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anything is going to roil markets if no NAFTA deal and if the  U.S. pulls out and then we've got no trade going on with China and Mexico.   I totally agree that the markets looking -- go ahead Dennis, jump in. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Well, yes.  We have to pay attention what's going on in the NAFTA  talks because what a lot of people are forgetting to understand is that  there's a presidential election coming up in Mexico on July 1st and the  fellow who's going to win that unless something untoward is to change is an  overt Marxist then we have to pay attention to that fact.  We need to get  this NAFTA agreement passed and passed very quickly, and if it doesn't pass  in the next two or three weeks or certainly in the next month then there's  trouble ahead.</p><p>KELLY:  Dennis, you think we've hit peak market right here and I think one  of the things to be cognizant of is that because of the multiples?  And you  don't think that we should be trading at 18 times earnings, maybe we should  be trading times 16 times earnings because we're anticipating to make 150  some dollars this year in earnings on the S&amp;P 500, next year 170, so the  earning story is going to get better, but are what you're saying -- are you  saying that people aren't going to be willing to pay up for that? </p><p>GARTMAN:  I think 18 times earnings is relatively high.  We could get to 20  times earnings.  I don't -- I don't doubt that for a moment.  But what  bothers me and what people are not paying attention to is historically,  stock markets do indeed make their highs long before economic activity  turns down.  What ends up happening at the bottom is the monetary  authorities begin to impact expansionary.  That money moves into equities  before it moves into planned equipment and labor, and at the peak as plant,  and equipment, and labor demands capital back, and while the monetary  authorities are beginning to tighten, there is less -- there is less  liquidity to sponsor plant equipment and labor, and so the money comes out  of the stock market.  It's very normal. </p><p>It's very historically unprecedented and I think that that's indeed what's  going to be happening here over the course of next year or two.  So yes,  the economy in the United States doing quite well.  I do not doubt that for  a moment.  It's going to continue to do well for another year or two, but  it's going to be very difficult unless the monetary authorities become  expansionary once again and they shall not do that, Dagen, I think it's  absolutely right.  They've laid out the plans very clearly as to how  they're going to run off or allow these -- the debt securities - the  treasury's that they own to run off out of maturity.  They're not going to  be expansionary and that's going to be contractionary for the equities over  time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to do then?  What do you do about the  portfolio then, Dennis?</p><p>GARTMAN:  I think you go to cash.  I think you go to short-term treasury  securities.  I think you go to the ETF's that are short-term bond funds and  I think you sit on the sidelines and wait.  I think sometimes the sidelines  is not a bad place to be, not too many people want to always be 100 percent  invested.  As I've said in my newsletter in a bear market, there are three  positions you can have, very bearish, modestly bearish or neutral, right  now, perhaps neutrality is the best position of all to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Dennis, always great  insights from you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>GARTMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Well, see you soon, sir, Dennis Gartman  there.  President Trump will host French president Emmanuel Macron  meanwhile at a state dinner tonight.  But the Iran nuclear deal will be top  of this agenda ahead of the festivities.  Blake Burman at the White House  right now with the latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  There is already that dinner last night.  The official state  dinner is later this evening and in between later this morning will be the  official bilateral meeting between President Trump and Emmanuel Macron.  A  host of different issues on the plate for the two world leaders, but non- possibly bigger than the Iran nuclear deal.  The White House is standing  behind its stance that the president believes this is a bad deal.  He has a  decision to make about whether to stay in or possibly get out by May 12th.   Ahead of the visit, Macron was saying that the president should not leave  the Iran nuclear deal if there is not a Plan B.  Iran's Foreign Minister  agreed and the Iranian president now has sent out this warning saying and,  \"If someone wants to betray our nation and the deal, grave consequences  will affect them.\"  The Press Secretary yesterday Sarah Sanders was  noncommittal about the possibility of a realistic Plan D. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does the White House believe that there is actually a  realistic Plan B out there? </p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We certainly think that there  should be a better deal one that actually is positive that works.  And we  don't really typically look to the leadership in Iran to determine what our  foreign policy is. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Beyond that Maria, they will -- are expected President Trump and  Macron to be discussing trade issues, of course, the situation inside  Syria, and also the Paris Climate Accord.  Once Macron wraps up his visit  here at White House, he's not over here in Washington, D.C. because  tomorrow he will address Congress, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the joint session of Congress tomorrow.  Blake will be  watching that as well.  Thanks so much.  Blake Burman at the White House.   Coming up, Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo wins support of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee after Senator Rand Paul changes his  mind.  I'll speak with the Kentucky Senator about why he flipped his vote  coming up.  And then Goldman Sachs jumps on the Bitcoin bandwagon, the  company's new higher in the cryptocurrency market right here next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Police in Toronto is still searching for motive  in yesterday's deadly van rampage.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police  have identified the suspect who drove that van, 25-year-old Alek Minassian  of Toronto.  He's currently under arrest charge with killing 10 people and  injuring 15 others.  Witnesses said it was chaos. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He just went on the sidewalk.  He just started hitting  everybody -- a bus stop everything got shattered because there are a lot of  people got hurt.  I've seen the scene I've never seen in my life. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Officials are still trying to determine his motive but they say so  far there's no evidence the attack is linked to terrorism.  This happened  while foreign ministers leading G7 nations or holding talks in Toronto.   Well, former President George H. W. Bush has been hospitalized just one day  after the funeral for his wife Barbara.

A Michigan high school student was about to tee off when a  goose attacked him on the course.  It turns out this goose was sitting on  her egg in a nest decided to do to defend herself.  He fell over.  Only his  ego was bruised.  These birds are mean, Maria.  We had one on our farm in  Texas and that goose at the time when I was a kid attacked me and bit me.   Watch out for these things. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, knocked him right over. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Respect for the goose.  Respect for the goose.  I worked on a  golf course.  You know what, you're in their territory.  You better getting  -- </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the mama was protecting her --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holly Mollie.  OK.  Coming up heroism in the face of tragic.   We'll speak with James Shaw Jr. live.  Yes, the courageous man who stopped  the Waffle House shooter.  He's coming up next.  And then another big day  of earnings, Verizon one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell.   The company beat first quarter earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll  break down the numbers coming up.  And in roughly 10 minutes, I'll speak  with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member Rand Paul.   Join us with the senator coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The man accused of killing four people at a  Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee this weekend is expected to make his  first appearance in court this morning after police in Tennessee arrested  him yesterday ending a nearly 36 hour  manhunt.  The accused gunman 29- year-old Travis Reinking opened fire with an assault style rifle early  Sunday morning fatally wounding four people in and outside the restaurant  before a customer intervened, James Shaw Jr. managed to tackle the gunman  and wrestle away his rifle.  Undoubtedly saving more lives.  Joining us  right now is the hero himself, Waffle House help James Shaw Jr.  Mr. Shaw,  thank you so much for joining us this morning and congratulations and thank  you to you.</p><p>JAMES SHAW JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  Thank you for inviting me and having me  on your show. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just incredible what you did.  Tell us what was going  through your mind.  Was this just an immediate reaction, you saw what was  happening and you just jumped to try to tackle this guy?  What happened? </p><p>SHAW:  So by the time he entered, I was -- he had already shot towards the  bathroom and that's when a bullet grazed my upper -- I have to try to -- in  this situation.  And then once I noticed that he was refilling -- reloading  the gun --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reloading, yes.</p><p>SHAW:  Yes, reloading his gun.  The barrel was down and I just choose then  to, you know, my opportunity to attack because I didn't see like I was  going to have another window.</p><p>BRENBERG:  James, Brian Brenberg here.  Thank you for everything you did.   One of the things I really appreciated about how you reflected on this as  you said, look, I was actually just trying to save my own life.  I wasn't  trying to be a hero necessarily, you know, was it really just in that  moment, you know, I'm in danger, what do I have to do?  Did you see others  around you at all and think about what can I do to maybe, you know, create  a solution for the folks in this dinner as well?  How are you thinking  about that? </p><p>SHAW:  So when he -- like I said when he first started coming in, he shot  towards the bathroom and there were -- there was probably six or seven of  us in the separate bathrooms in the men or women's bathroom, however, I was  actually in the hallway because I didn't want to go in the bathroom because  there's -- I mean there's only one way out.  So I didn't want to go in the  bathroom, so I just went to keep an eye on him and then it worked out in my  favor because I saw him reloading and I just made it up in my mind that if  he was going to kill me he was going to have to work for this kill, and I'm  grateful, and very glad that I did do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean do you understand how many people you saved because  later they found all of these bullets and magazines in his pocket, he was  pretty locked and loaded and could have killed a lot of people that day?</p><p>SHAW:  Right.  That's the, you know, the day it happened, of course, I  didn't know that he had all that in his jacket pocket.  But I was -- I was  guessing that he did have, you know, was going to reload or do something,  so I'm glad that I intervened and I'm glad to have saved myself and saved  everybody else also.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was he naked?  Was he naked, James, because he did -- he got  out of the car initially naked with the green jacket, right? </p><p>SHAW:  Yes, he was he was naked.  He was only wearing the green jacket,  yes, ma'am. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, how -- this is Dagen McDowell, how has this changed your  outlook on life say human nature? </p><p>SHAW:  So after I visited some of the victims that were in critical  condition at Vanderbilt Hospital, they are now in stable condition now.  I  want to go and get something to eat at Panera Bread and, now, instead of me  looking for the exit, I actually completely sat beside the exit.  When I  was walking downtown for another interview, I can't help but not look -- I  mean look over my shoulder.  It's just, you know, right now, it's hard for  me to trust strangers because of this incident because it makes it really,  really tough to trust that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  James, it's so wonderful to have you on the show.  Thank  you.  We owe you a debt all of us do, and we love you James.  Thank you so  much.  You're a hero.  </p><p>SHAW:  All right.  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Shaw Jr. joining us there.  Congratulations, sir.  Coming  up, I'll speak with Kentucky Senator and Foreign Relations Committee member  Rand Paul.  He weighs in on the Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, tax  reform, and a lot more.  Rand Paul right after this break.  And then  Caterpillar, one of six Dow companies reporting before the bell this  morning, the equipment company beat first quarter earnings and revenue  estimates.  We break down the other blue chip results after this.  Back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  The blue chip buzz on  Wall Street.  Six Dow components all reporting earnings before the opening  bell this morning.  Caterpillar leading the way beating expectations on  profit and revenue also raising its full-year guidance.  The stock is up  better than four percent.  United Technologies and Verizon also delivering  a double beat on revenue as well as profits.  The numbers are lifting the  stocks involved, although 3M is down four percent on the opposite.  Futures  however showing a big gain at the start of trading this morning.  </p><p>Take a look, Dow Industrials expected to be up 150 points at the open,  that's two-thirds of one percent.  We got the S&amp;P 500 up 15 and the NASDAQ  up 32 points, that's also one-half of one percent.  In Europe this morning,  the indices are higher across the board.  FT-100 up 26 points, the CAC  Quarante up a half a point, and the DAX Index in Germany up just four  points, fractional moves for most of these indices.  In Asia overnight,  stocks closed mostly higher.  The Shanghai Composite in China, the best  performer, up nearly two percent overnight.</p><p>Kicking off this half an hour, a hurdle cleared on the CIA Director Mike  Pompeo's nomination to be Secretary of State.  The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee approved the nomination with a vote of 11 to nine.  This coming  after a key holdout changed his mind in the 11th hour.  Joining me right  now in a first on Fox Business interview, member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  Senator Paul, good to  see you, Sir, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you change your mind?</p><p>PAUL:  You know, I think we've been at war for too long and too many places  and I think the President tends to agree with me, but I wanted him to be  surrounded by advisers who also agree with the President.  You know, the  President said very clearly the Iraq war was a mistake.  I think the Iraq  war is part of the most instructive foreign policy disaster of the last  couple decades, and we should learn from it, and I kept asking Director  Pompeo, was the Iraq war a mistake, do you agree with the President?  I  wasn't getting a good answer, but finally, over the last few days, I got  more a succinct answer from both the President and from Director Pompeo and  a promise that he will be very public with saying that he does agree with  the President's vision of the world.  I think that combined with fact that  the President now has opened the door to negotiations with North Korea and  that Pompeo is part of that.  All of that figured into it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I was reading your tweets yesterday, I guess,  after you had a meeting with the President and you said that based on your  conversation, you believed that Secretary Pompeo agreed with the President  that, in fact, less entanglements is better than more entanglements.</p><p>PAUL:  I guess it's a good way to put it in general.  We're probably not  all in exactly the same place.  I'm ready to leave Afghanistan yesterday.   I wouldn't send one more soldier there.  I don't think they're exactly  there but I think even Pompeo in his written questions admitted there is no  military solution to Afghanistan.  And my point is if there's no military  solution, why would you send one more young man or woman over there to risk  their life? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand what you're saying, but then there's  Syria, and the President recently said, look, we're going to be taking our  men and women home from Syria relatively soon.  And that created a lot of  upset, because even people like General Jack Keane, four-star general,  says, look if you pull out of Syria right now, you're going to have a  vacuum just the way we pulled out of Iraq and ISIS will get stronger.  Do  you disagree with that, Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Yes, this is -- absolutely disagree with it.  This is the answer of  all the neo-cons, they want to stay everywhere and they predict profound,  you know, disaster if we ever leave.  But that's an answer -- that's a sort  of response that has a staying everywhere all of the time, so no.  I think  Syria should be -- I think one of the ideas that's been floated is having  more local countries participate in it.  The people who live there ought to  be manning the armies.  We live thousands of miles away.  We shouldn't have  to occupy and keep the peace in every country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, fair enough, but do you agree that when President Obama  pulled out of Iraq, it created a vacuum and created ISIS.</p><p>PAUL:  No, I would say that when we attacked Saddam Hussein and toppled  him, we created a vacuum and a crisis and chaos there, and it's persistent  to this day.  When you look at ISIS and where ISIS actually arose, ISIS  arose in the civil war of Syria not in Iraq.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Senator, did the President make any promises to you as far  as pulling out of Syria?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we talked more in general terms and I don't think it's  really appropriate to try to pin him down on, hey, we have to leave by next  week or I'm not voting for him.  But I heard loud and clear from the  President, and I tell you, loud and clear, and with very specific language,  that he's very much in my -- you know, with me on a lot of the ideas that  we've been at war too long in too many places.  And I think people are  going to be surprised over the next year or two that I think there will be  some ending of some of the wars around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the issues, of course, with that omnibus bill  recently was the fact that this is a $1.3-trillion omnibus bill, but the  fact that the GOP wanted to protect the military.  And that's why we ended  up spending all of that money which, of course, was really an issue for a  lot of conservatives, you included.</p><p>PAUL:  I think it's -- yes, I think it's probably the opposite, though, I  think if you spend yourself into a $22-trillion debt, you actually make  your country weaker.  So, I disagree with those people who say, oh, we got  to expand, we got to give a blind check to the military.  I think it's  actually making us weaker as we go further and further into debt.  So, I  think our national security is best protected by not having our mission too  large.  I think our mission is too large or in too many countries.  We  don't have left -- money left over to upgrade our nuclear arsenal, upgrade  our missile defenses and to actually pay our troops better.  So, I would do  all those things but I would do it and pay for it by actually not being in  Afghanistan and spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that we should have disallowed the government  to close down then for this omnibus?  Because House Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy was in the studio here yesterday and he takes aim at your chamber  for the massive amount of spending.  Listen to this, Sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  (INAUDIBLE) why you  even got into an omni.  The House did all the work.  We passed all 12 of  our appropriation bills.  The challenge was the minority in the Senate, not  voting against the appropriation bill, but voting against to even allow it  to come up to be debated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, your reaction?</p><p>PAUL:  Some true and some untrue.  We actually I don't think ever  filibustered an appropriation bill in the last year.  We didn't bring them  up, so the Senate did not do a shot.  The appropriation bill were not  brought forward in a timely fashion one at a time, but I don't believe  there was ever (AUDIO GAP) hearing them as much as I'm against spending I  typically will vote not to filibuster spending bills and to actually hear  the spending bills.  So, true and not so true, what he said.  But I do  think that the point is that we're spending too much money on what the  leadership in the House are bragging about that they put forward, was a  disaster to conservatives because it was a gross overspending of money and  spending of money.  We're actually going to have a trillion-dollar deficit  this year as bad as Obama.  That's what we ran against.  So, I think it's a  great deal of hypocrisy going on right now with the Republican leadership,  allowing and actually supporting budgets that we railed against when they  were President Obama's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I want to talk to you about your penny plan but  before I get there, do you -- are you in favor of this rescission plan to  actually rescind some of the spending?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  I haven't seen exactly what's in it, so we need to know  what's in it before we decide how to vote on it but actually (INAUDIBLE)  clawing back and spending less money is what I've been pitching for a long  time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about your penny plan to balance the federal budget?   Tell us about it.</p><p>PAUL:  The penny plan, I think, is easier to get broad bipartisan support  for because it doesn't cut all of one program, it cuts one percent of every  program, and frankly, I think there's enough waste even in the military to  cut one percent of it, and make government more efficient.  The only way  you'll ever get rid of waste in government is to give them less funds.  If  you say, oh, we've got waste, we're going to cut waste next year but we're  going to give you a hundred billion dollars more in the Pentagon, there  won't be any waste cut.  If we give you one percent less, they'll be waste  cut, but if you cut one percent a year, the penny plan, for five years, the  budget actually balances.  I've introduced that now and we will force a  vote on the Senate.  In the next week or two, we will get a vote on my  budget, and also have reconciliation instructions to allow a simple  majority in the Senate to vote to expand health savings accounts to every  American.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, is spending on the wall in your budget because it's  pretty extraordinary that we're talking about a $47-trillion budget here  and there wasn't even a $25 billion that the President wanted for his wall?</p><p>PAUL:  I think we have to have border security and it is part of our  national security to have border security.  I think we can debate on how  much it should cost.  Some of the estimates of $20 million a mile, I think,  are outlandish.  And I think we can also use technology.  I've met some  young inventors who talked about using sonar and cameras and other things  that really wouldn't be a wall for 2000 miles.  I think we can use walls in  some of the urban areas, but I think, really, we ought to use technology.   It's much less expensive in many of the other areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, did you discuss this with the President yesterday?</p><p>PAUL:  We didn't talk about the wall so much.  We really talked about his  vision of the world and war.  His concern for the veterans, he talked about  his trips with Walter Reed and talked about, you know, meeting the veterans  and being affected the same way all of us are as we see these young men who  have sacrificed so much.  And that's why I say not one soldier more.  I  mean, if there's no military mission, if there -- you know, there's no  military mission left really in Syria for goodness sakes, it's going to be  a political solution, same with Yemen, same with Afghanistan.  So, if these  are going to be political solutions, let's quit sending our soldiers there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about what Lindsey Graham says, and that is, look,  you may be tired of fighting with the extremists but guess what, they're  not tired of fighting with you.</p><p>PAUL:  He's been wrong about every foreign policy sort of pronouncement of  the last 40 years.  He's a neoconservative who really doesn't have concern  for the constitution or the bill of rights but really wants to be at war  everywhere.  And I think the wars are bankrupting us and I think sometimes  you create more terrorists than you kill.  If you want to go to every  remote village in Africa and kill a chieftain over there and say, oh, we  got somebody from Al-Qaeda, well, you create 10 for every you kill.  So, I  think he's been wrong about most things like this, and I think people would  be wise to think through what he's been saying because it's bankrupting our  country and it's a terrible foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know that there are a number of programs going  bankrupt like entitlements like Social Security, like Medicare, like  Medicaid.  Now, we're getting new details about a phase two tax cut plan.   I spoke with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady earlier  this morning, here's what he said.  Listen to this, Senator. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  This  year, we're looking at issues like, can we help families save more and  earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in the  United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not yet  permanent provisions of the tax cut?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's talking about make things permanent like the individual  tax cuts, like the expensing, would you support a phase two tax cut plan,  Sir?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  And I think this is something, you know, many of the  Democrats were complaining and saying, oh, the tax cuts are not going to be  permanent, so it's not really going to help individuals.  Well, I think  we'd like to make it permanent and if the Democrats would join with us, I  think we could make the individual tax side permanent.  And really, the  individual side is where we really helped a lot of the working class out  with this recent tax cut.  So, making that permanent would be a huge step  forward, and hopefully, the Democrats who criticized us over that will join  us to make it permanent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see where that leads.  And real quick,  finally, Iran's President, Senator, is warning that the U.S. is going to  see grave consequences if Washington withdraws from the 2015 Iran nuclear  deal.  This coming as the French President Emmanuel Macron is said to hold  talks with the President today over that nuclear deal and threats from  North Korea and Syria.  Macron wants to urge the President to not withdraw  from the controversial agreement.  Your expectation, Sir.</p><p>PAUL:  I think the most important thing is, is Iran adhering to the  agreement, and so far, all indications have been that they adhered to it.   I don't think it was the best agreement in the world, and I think we could  have done better, but we have the agreement.  It is a multilateral  agreement in the sense that many other countries joined with us in the  agreement, so I think it would be a mistake to exit hastily from it,  particularly if Iran is adhering to it.  Now, there's a more complicated  arms race going on in the Middle East, and people have to realize that Iran  reacts to Saudi Arabia, that is their rival in the region.  So, when we  sell $300 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Iran will react and  continue to develop their weapons.  So, people have to realize that it is  an action and a reaction, and that it can't be seen just as, oh, here is  evil, Iran, and they're creating weapons.  Well, they're doing it in  response to Saudi Arabia, back-and-forth.  Who started it?  I don't know,  but it is an arms race. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Senator, it's good to see you, Sir.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>PAUL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great conversation.  Senator Rand Paul joining us there in  Washington.  Coming up, Coca-Cola one of six Dow companies reporting before  the opening bell this morning.  The company beat earnings and revenue  expectations due in part to a Diet Coke reboot.  Stuart Varney will weigh  in on the earnings split this morning.  Then retirement realities, the  shocking study that says your employer could be to blame for limited  retirement savings.  We'll get into it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're covering earnings.  The story on Wall  Street this morning, Caterpillar lifting the Dow Industrials after a  stronger-than-expected first quarter.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of  the New York Stock Exchange with the breakdown.  Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  thus far, we've seen earnings coming in, 19 percent of the S&amp;P 500  companies have come in, and you have 78 percent of those beat again  earnings per share.  And let's put Caterpillar right in there, it's been a  busy earnings week.  Stock is up 3.6 percent, beating on both the top and  bottom line.  We saw profit sales and also the full-year outlook also  raised.  So, you have a beat across the board here for Caterpillar, higher  demand, better-than-expected sales.  We heard from Citigroup yesterday.   They did put a buy rating on this particular stock.  They added nearly  11,000 jobs, and the increased volume helped to boost total sales by 38  percent.  I will note that the stock is down about nine percent since its  last quarter, concerns about the trade dispute.  Trade worries have  certainly hit some stocks.  </p><p>Then, we take a look at another mover, and that is Wells Fargo.  Wells  Figer (ph) -- Fargo, right now, is up about a half of one percent.  But  today is the shareholder meeting, it's in Des Moines, Iowa, not in San  Francisco.  There would have been even more protesters, activists.  You  know, regulators have been on this.  The Trump administration has been  tough on this one, fining Wells Fargo a billions dollars for the car  insurance and mortgage abuses, but it was a year and a half ago, for fake  accounts, millions of them, and today, the activists and the shareholders  are going to get in there and voice their opinion.  They're calling for the  CEO to be fired and for the board to be removed, and even a breakup of it  because they believe it's too big and too bloated.  Of course, Wells Fargo  saying that they've been doing all that they can and they want to listen  and make some more changes.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Nicole, thank you.  Coca-Cola  seeing a nice pop this morning after beating expectations on its profit and  revenue estimates.  The sales surged following the company's risky Diet  Coke reboot.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney  to weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's what got me, Maria.  If  you look inside that earnings report from Coca-Cola, there's something very  interesting going on.  Five percent organic growth.  Now, Maria, you know I  hate this jargon stuff.  I take that as growth from the inside of the  company, as opposed to growth by acquisition.  Five percent growth for a  health and beverage company, I should say a beverage company is very  unusual.  Turns out that Diet Coke was the driver of this organic growth.   And Coke Zero was a close second.  It's expanding at a double-digit rate.   Apparently, I don't -- I never touch this stuff, but apparently, they've  got all kinds of brand-new flavors, like ginger, and apparently, that's a  really big deal.  And up goes their earnings, up goes the stock, I think  that's a cultural phenomenon because we always thought that soda, classic  soda, sugar-water was going out, and so it is, but flavored drinks with no  sugar, apparently are doing very well.  I think that's a cultural shift on  the part of the millennials.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true because people are trying to avoid sugar, so they  figured a way around it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's it.  That's it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coca-Cola did.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink that stuff?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's nice to see that kind of innovation from within,  you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  Do you drink it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't.  I don't drink soda but I used to drink Diet Coke and  that was my favorite soda, Diet Coke, but I haven't had it in years.</p><p>VARNEY:  As long as it's got caffeine in it, that's why I drink Mountain  Dew, OK?  That's it.  You (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My coffee does that for me.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, great to see you.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  We can discuss this endlessly, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But I know you've got a lot out on the Macron visit,  so we're going to be there in 10 minutes, Stu, thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart as he looks into that meeting between the  President and President Macron.  First though, could your boss be to blame  for lack of retirement savings.  Details on the shocking study that could  affect your financial future, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans struggling with savings for the  golden years, one in three people have nothing stashed away for retirement,  nothing, according to gobankingrates.com.  Just over half have saved less  than $10,000.  Now, a new study suggest their employers may be partially to  blame.  Joining us now, the author of \"Retire Inspired\" and Ramsey  Solutions' Financial Expert, Chris Hogan.  Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, only 59 percent of Americans have access to a 401(k) plan  through their employer.  Is that the issue?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the bigger issue is really, Maria, people understanding just  how important it is that we take steps to be able to help ourselves.  So, I  think it's less about trying to blame the employer, if they don't have  access and it's more about taking personal responsibility.  Victim-thinking  is a dangerous think in this country, but we have to do is have personal  responsibility.  And people are doing it, they're waking up and they're  starting to listen as I travel and speak around the country.  They just  need to know what steps to take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, bottom line, if you don't have access to a 401(k), open an  IRA?</p><p>HOGAN:  That's exactly correct.  And think of an IRA as just an account, an  arrangement that allows you to save for yourself with stocks, bonds, mutual  funds, but people don't know what steps to take and where to go.  So, I  want them to reach out, talk to an investment professional, really start to  sit down and understand the landscape, your goals, your timing, as well as  your opportunities, and we can start to take steps in the right direction.</p><p>KELLY:  Chris, one of the best things you could do is open up a Roth IRA,  if you're -- if you're a younger investor because it's after tax money, it  grows tax free, and it's -- they're -- it's easy to invest in.  Are you  seeing people to utilize Roth IRAs?</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, Roth IRAs are a beautiful thing, and you're right, it is  after-tax dollars, so it gives you tax-free growth.  More and more people  are hearing this and waking up to it.  I'm getting calls into show \"Retire  Inspired\" where young people, 23, 24 years old are asking about it, but at  the same time, I'm hearing from people in their 50s and 60s that didn't  understand what was at stake and what they could do.  So, yes, we need to  keep spreading the word and helping people understand the tools that they  have available to them.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Chris, what's the biggest misconception people have about IRAs  that keep them from investing?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the biggest misconception is that people don't understand how  easy it is to open, they think it's a -- it's a very difficult complex  process, and it's really not.  It's a matter of a couple documents and then  you starting to fund it.  So, people understanding how easy it is I think  it allowed them to take more advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always great advice.  Pay yourself first, that means save first  before you spend.  Chris, thank you so much, great to see you, Sir.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you, ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris Hogan.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star  panel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some breaking news on United Technologies.  Not only  did it beat expectations, the company is just saying that it will  repatriate $3.8 billion from overseas to the United States.  That,  obviously, is exactly what the President wanted from his tax cut plan.   United Technologies will repatriate that money in overseas cash as a result  of the tax cut plan.  </p><p>Final thoughts from this all-star panel, right now.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  We're focusing on tech earnings.  Do you focus on the e-commerce,  the ecosystem, and look at the companies that service them?  Industrial  (INAUDIBLE) have done exceptionally well, Prologis last week actually  talked about how they're growing 25 percent.  So, if you can't get your  returns in tech, get the companies that are the backbones for them.  Stuff  from (INAUDIBLE) data centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Brian?  Brian?</p><p>BRENBERG:  You can talk a lot about cloud computing today.  I think it's  going to be a big week for Microsoft, for Amazon, too, that's a growing  business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And credit to Kevin, he turned me on to highball  energy drinks and I used to dismiss them.  And so, his feelings were hurt.   That, and making fun of you earlier about the --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KELLY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, April 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Blue chips buzz on Wall Street, earnings for six Dow components all due out  before the opening bell this morning.  That's in the next two hours.</p><p>Travelers, Coca-Cola, United Technologies just hitting the wire; Coke and  United both beating expectations with their first quarter numbers.   Travelers is coming in mixed, missing on profit.  Take a look at the stocks  right after the numbers are released.  Coca-Cola shares up 1 percent,  United Technologies up one and two-thirds percent, travelers shares down  three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>Check futures this morning.  We are expecting a pretty good rally at the  start of trading.  Dow Industrials expected to be up about 140 points, two- thirds of 1 percent.  S&amp;P is also up two-thirds and the Nasdaq is up two- thirds of 1 percent with a 45-point move.</p><p>This after yesterday when markets closed mostly lower, weighed down by  rising bond yields.  The Dow down for a fourth session in a row, the  longest losing streak since March.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this, take a look.  FT  100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris is flat and the DAX index  in Germany up a quarter of a percent as well.</p><p>Revenues at Travelers were above estimates, by the way, as you see there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly higher.  The shanghai composite the  top performer, up nearly 2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour -- tackling tax cuts phase two as voters  head to the polls this fall for the midterm elections.</p><p>Republicans are hoping to pass another round of tax cuts later this year.   A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that more people view the  Republican tax overhaul as a bad idea, rather than a good one.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas.  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Good morning --  Marie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it amazing to you that we get this poll where it says  that these people -- most people are not seeing the tax plan as a positive?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Well, I think the narrative has been just so brutal for the  past year.  But when they asked the questions, Maria, you get different  answers.  When you ask people you want to keep -- should you be able to  keep more of what you worked so hard to earn, you want to see the standard  deduction doubled, do you want to get more help raising your kids, do you  want to see those paychecks rise?  The answer invariably is yes.</p><p>I think just a general comment you sometimes get a different answer.  But  back home, I can tell you Main Street optimism is at an all-time high.   People are really appreciating just keeping more of what they earn.  And  now, we're seeing dollars come back overseas being invested in America,  exactly the opposite of what we've seen for two decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  So I think that it's very positive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a very powerful legislation.  We know.  We've  seen already a big impact with animal spirits really moving in the  corporate sector.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about phase two.  Do you want to do a phase two  tax cut plan?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I do.  And it's probably different than what most people  think.  We want to change the culture in Washington where once every 30  years we reform the tax code and in between we fall farther behind and we  just do a lot of special breaks.</p><p>We're talking about trying to do what businesses do, which is every year  Congress look at the tax code, ask themselves can we be more competitive as  a country?  Can we be innovative?  Can we be better?  Can we stretch  paychecks farther?</p><p>So this year we're looking at issues like can we help families save more  and earlier throughout their lifetime?  Can we spur more innovation here in  the United States?  And can we make permanent some of the long-term but not  yet permanent provisions of the tax code?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to make the cuts for personal permanent.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think that ought to be done.  And I also think there's a 2.0  and a 3.0.  And my point is like businesses, continually getting better  every year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It will evolve?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in terms of expensing and the corporate sector -- what do  you want to see done in terms of business cuts?  </p><p>BRADY:  I have no doubt that that will be made permanent.  The question is  when.  We'll just find the right timing for it because we've already seen  investment unleashed, you know, throughout the economy, because businesses  large and small are now able to write those off, those capital investments  the year they buy them.  It's really powerful.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do about spending, Mr. Chairman?  I mean  we've seen reports in the last few weeks that President Trump wants to claw  back as much as $60 billion from the $1.3 trillion omnibus.  Yesterday we  had Kevin McCarthy in the chair here saying that look, the rescission is  not about the omnibus, it's about looking for revenue that's not used but  you voted for that massive spending bill.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of complaining about that $1.3 million bill.  What are  you going to do about it?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I think that omnibus was about historic rebuilding of  America's national defense -- exactly what we needed to do.  But it's also  a symbol of a broken budget system for more than a decade.  The House is  passing these bills separately in a small way.  The Senate is not able to  pass any.  And so we end up with something no one wants.</p><p>So I think -- I welcome these rescissions.  I think we ought to wake up  every day, looking at wasteful spending, things that aren't a priority, and  so I think these rescissions and this process is a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  So do you think that we will in fact see it?  Because  Mitch McConnell told Neil Cavuto recently it's not even on the table.   We're not going to look at any -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it ought to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're not bringing it to the floor.</p><p>BRADY:  Yes, I think it ought to be.  I think we're -- look I think we're  spending too much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  There is wasteful spending.  That omnibus is because the system is  broken.  And so let's do what we can now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you didn't want to shut down the government.  You didn't  think so enough to say look, I'm not signing this.  </p><p>BRADY:  No.  And look, at the end of the day, I think President Reagan had  two big legacies -- tax reform and rebuilding the military.  So that's  exactly what we're doing in the first two years of President Trump -- tax  reform and rebuilding our national security.  That's important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- there's a narrative out there right now that  things will begin to slow down in 2019.  I spoke with the president of the  Dallas Federal Reserve who said look, yes, we're looking for 2.7 percent  economic growth this year but by the time '19 going into '20 comes along  we're talking about growth of 1.75 percent.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>BRADY:  No, I don't.  Look I think there's been sort of an economic  narrative that America has to settle for this 2 percent growth.  We've seen  that.  It's why we drove tax reform is to break out of that sort of  sluggish economy.</p><p>And so no, I see the economy moving.  But I'll tell you there's two things  we need to do right to maximize off this tax reform.  One -- we need more  customers, that's free trade including a modern NAFTA.</p><p>And second, we need a better workforce.  Because I'll guarantee you, all  across the country companies large and small are turning away work because  they don't have the workforce they need.  That's something the House and  Congress need to address.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the reason that I raise it -- so many people are  expecting that we're going to see better growth numbers continue and that  will pay some part of the tab for the tax cut bill.  And Nancy Pelosi and  the others said it's absolutely BS that anything's going to pay for itself.  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, listen, she is exactly wrong and has been throughout this  whole process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she has.</p><p>BRADY:  And she really misled the American voters about the tax relief they  give but even -- even if you accept the Congressional Budget Office's  numbers, even they admitted revenues will grow after tax reform.  They  increase by a trillion dollars.  So on a static basis, two-thirds of it is  already -- will be recouped already and that's under economic growth I  think that will be ultimately higher than what they predict.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington for  the state visit for the Trump presidency.  The President of France is set  to address a joint session of Congress tomorrow.  What would you like to  hear from the president of France?  </p><p>BRADY:  Look, I think it's important for us to have national security  alliances.  That's very important.  We saw the importance of that in Syria.</p><p>Secondly, trade alliances.  Look we do need a modern trading relationship  with all of Europe.  France could play a key role in that.  And so I'd like  to see those ties strengthen as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to see bilateral deals, U.S.-France, U.S.-U.K.?  Is  that the kind of trade story you're talking about?  </p><p>BRADY:  You know, I would like to see more regional (ph) ones because I  think you've been just like -- whether you sell your products to one  business or sell them to a chain with a hundred stores, I like the regional  approach.  But President Trump likes that country by country, believes we  can get better concessions that way.</p><p>So you know, I think they deserve a chance to show that can create the jobs  we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we in NAFTA?  Do you know?  I mean recently Vice  President Mike Pence said look, we're going to be close.  But I keep  questioning it because I know that there are elections in Mexico this  summer.  Are we going to be able to do a deal, get something done, even a  blueprint of a new NAFTA deal before those Mexico elections?  </p><p>BRADY:  I think we can.  I know that the U.S. under Bob Lighthizer, Mexico  and Canada want an agreement.  They've done an awful lot of good work.</p><p>I was down in Mexico City for the seventh negotiating round.  I think  they're very close.  I think at the end of the day, people are debating  what's the best strategy going forward.  I think the best strategy is  deliver to Congress a modern NAFTA that creates more jobs and allows us to  sell more made in America products in Mexico and Canada, that's the best  strategy for the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So far House Speaker Paul Ryan says that he's endorsing  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to replace him when he retires.  Here's what  McCarthy said yesterday about that endorsement when he joined us on the  program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Our top leader has  endorsed but the most important thing here is we have to make sure there's  an opportunity for a Republican to even run for Speaker next year.</p><p>So we have our work cut out for us.  We have a great team in this  conference.  We're fighting hard.  We've got a lot of successes.  But we've  got a November election to go forward.  So it's a little premature -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So look, premature or not, will you support Kevin McCarthy?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Look, I think Kevin McCarthy's done an amazing job.  I think  what Kevin just said there is as a conference, focus on our work, preserve  this majority.  You know, he's going to have an opportunity to show the  great leadership he's done as majority leader, transfers to the  speakership.  We've got to work together to make sure we're competing for a  Speaker's race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to hold on to the majority in the house?  I  mean, you know, most people will say, look, in a presidential, you know,  two terms, typically, you've got even in the middle of one term you've got  that party losing seats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  History's pretty rough -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BRADY:  -- on the majority party.  On the other hand, we're delivering two  of the biggest things with this president in history.  One is a new tax  code that makes America more competitive and actually allows people to keep  more of what they earn.</p><p>And secondly, rebuilding the military in a way that keeps us safer.  And at  the end of the day, I think Americans will have a choice.  They either want  to give back more of their money to a Washington that wastes too much of it  or do they want a new economic growth that people are seeing and feeling  along Main Street.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, will voters hold the Dems to account since not one of  them voted for the tax cut plan?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Not only did no one vote for it, but they want to repeal  those taxes, not to lower the debt, for more Washington spending.  I just  think that goes against -- I haven't, Maria, met anyone in Texas who said I  really wish Washington would take more of what we earn and let's go back to  the old tax code where jobs were going overseas.  I just don't -- I haven't  heard that yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think because of the tax cut plan and its implications  on the economy triggering more growth and you think because of the  protecting of the military, this will be enough to help you hold onto the  majority in the House?  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, I think we have to continue to drive our agenda which is  still to get this economy moving.  I think trade is really important.  I  think a workforce is really important.  And on the rescissions -- doing  everything we can to not waste people's tax dollars.  I think that's an  important part of this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of the work right now and how work might change, the  training, when you say that's very important, what do you want to do?  Are  you going to be putting forth new programs in terms of training employees  for what they need to have going forward?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  You really need three things I think to solve this for the  long term.  We won't get to everything this year.  One -- a smart  immigration policy; secondly, better workforce and Virginia Fox, the  chairwoman of the Education Work Force is leading that but I also think  we've got millions of Americans, Maria, who are on the sidelines in the  welfare system government has sort of given up on.  We haven't.</p><p>We need them and want them back in the workforce.  I think you're going to  see action by the House this year to start that process, to give them some  opportunities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that. </p><p>Let me take you to Texas.  The Supreme Court is set to hear a case today  that could reshape political districts across your home state of Texas.   The case is over whether Texas congressional and state house maps were  drawn with the intent to discriminate against Hispanic and black voters.  A  decision in the case expected some time this summer.  This changes a lot  when you redistrict.  </p><p>BRADY:  It would but I don't think the underlying narrative is accurate.   Look, we're in maps that the courts themselves drew.  You know, they  decided that the legislature hadn't done an appropriate job.  They redrew  the maps to be compliant.  That's what's being challenged here.  And so I  think it's highly unusual for the Supreme Court to overturn a map that's  been drawn by, you know, an independent court in Texas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  I feel like that's what Eric Holder is  spending a lot of his time doing, looking across the country, figuring out  how to redistrict things to get more Democrats.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  And you know, what's interesting in Texas is that legislature  has drawn a number of minority seats that Anglo-Democrats or others have  won themselves.  And so at the end of the day, seats are drawn to favor  minority voters.  The voters themselves will choose others for that  position.  And so I really think that the maps are secure.  They're legal.   I think they are fair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me end where I began and that's on taxes.  What kind  of growth is possible this year?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I do think we can be well above 3 percent.  I think it  really depends on ensuring that we're building off the momentum from tax  reform.  Getting trade right I think it really matters to send that signal  that we're now armed with one of the most competitive tax codes in the  world.</p><p>Give us a chance to compete in Mexico and Canada, throughout the world.  I  guarantee you Americans will win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- it's great to see you.</p><p>BRADY:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRADY:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Brady joining us -- House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>Coming up, a wild scene aboard an American airlines flight after an unruly  passenger was tased with a taser gun 10 times before finally being forcibly  removed from the plane by Miami police.  That's just the beginning of the  story.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>And then from baby watch to name watch -- the world is awaiting the name of  the latest royal after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the hospital  with their third child -- a baby boy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Police in Toronto still searching for a motive in yesterday's deadly van  crash.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details on headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  Police have not  ruled out terrorism as a possible motive.  They have identified though the  suspect who drove that van -- 25-year-old Alek Minassian of Toronto.  He's  currently charged with killing 10 people and injuring 15 others.  This  incident happens while foreign ministers of the G-7 leading industrialized  nations -- Canada, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan -- were  all holding talks in Toronto.</p><p>Well, you're going to he see this -- a dramatic passenger take-down  unfolding on an American Airlines flight.  Miami police tasing a man on- board after he allegedly touched a woman inappropriately and then refused  to leave the plane.  Even other passengers were screaming for him to leave  the plane.</p><p>Jacob Garcia was arrested.  He's facing a slew of charges including  disorderly conduct.  The airline says the flight took for Chicago about an  hour late.  All remaining passengers were on that plane.</p><p>Well, we should also say this -- the CEO of United Airlines is taking now a  pay cut.  Oscar Munoz is giving up his bonus this year.  He's dropping his  compensation for 2017 to $9.6 million from $18.7 million the year before.   You're going to recall that Munoz was criticized heavily for his initial  response to a passenger being violently dragged off a plane last year and  his lack of timing of that response.  United also saying that Chairman  Robert Milton is stepping down.  The board is going to pick a new  independent chairman for the airline.  Taking a look at these stocks right  now -- both of them, American Airlines is down 10 percent so far this year,  UAL is actually up 6 percent for the year.</p><p>And then there is this, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are  leaving us waiting to hear the name of the new royal baby.  But we got  these great pictures.</p><p>Here are the top bets while we're looking.  How cute this is.  Arthur and  James are the two top bets according to the betting polls.  Mom Kate  showing off the baby -- she was wearing a red dress, which the zipping is  similar to the one that Princess Diana wore after Harry was born.  Kind of  interesting.</p><p>Another royal though seemed to have stolen the show yesterday.  Princess  Charlotte -- she's waving to the crowd as she and Prince William walked and  Prince George -- excuse Prince George -- she and Prince George walked to  meet their new baby brother.  The new prince is fifth in line to the throne  behind big sister Charlotte.  She gives a wave to the crowd.  Yes -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And Kate looks great.  I mean of course, she does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Listen, Charlotte stole the show with that little wave.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was the last wave -- the look over the shoulder, the  turn-around and kind of -- yes, it was </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She knows what she's doing.   </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She needs to work on the light bulb.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She's two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's so cute.  Well, look how cut cute she is.   Congratulations to them.  So what do you think the name is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's Arthur too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Arthur.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Charles' name -- their grandfather is Charles Philip Arthur  George, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to go with James.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got a George.  You can't name him Philip because that's  their great grandfather.  So I say Arthur.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I say too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Arthur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm with you.</p><p>Coming up, a late night pivot on Capitol Hill -- a senate panel approved  the confirmation of Mike Pompeo to be the next secretary of state after  Senator Rand Paul dropped his opposition.  I'll speak with Rand Paul later  on in the program.  Join us for that.</p><p>And then who says a monkey can't sue?  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  siding with a human photographer in a copyright fight over a monkey selfie.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New this morning -- a stern warning from Iran.  The country's  leader threatening, quote, \"severe consequences for any country that  betrays the nuclear deal\".  The message comes amid French President  Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the White House.  He's expected to urge  President Trump to not withdraw from the controversial Iran deal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Fox News senior strategic  analyst General Jack Keane.  General -- good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good to see  you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you expect from the talks between the two world  leaders -- Macron and President Trump.  And I want to get your take on this  Iran deal, the deadline is what -- May 12th.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In terms of recertifying it's May 12th.  But listen here's  the framework for the disagreements that we have -- the United States has  with Europeans.  Remember President Trump, what he put in place was a  process to fix the deal versus terminate it.  And if we can't fix it, then  we will terminate it.</p><p>Now, here's what they agree on.  The Europeans and the United States agree  that we should have access to the secret site.  So that should be added to  the deal.  We agree that we should also prohibit ballistic missile testing.   So that would be added to the deal.</p><p>But here's what we fundamentally disagree on.  We are a proponent of ending  the sunset clauses which gives -- which gives the Iranians a threshold  nuclear capability 10 years from the date the deal was signed, that was  July 2015; and 15 years of pathway to actual nuclear weapons.</p><p>The European as of now will not budge over that.  So I think that will be  the point of contention and a point of discussion between President Trump  and Macron today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised that the leader of Iran comes out and says  that there will be consequences if you get out of this Iran deal?  </p><p>KEANE:  No.  That kind of rhetoric has been there forever.  They talk about  every single year destroying the state of Israel, driving the United States  out of the region.  We're the big Satan.  They always have a huge amount of  rhetoric and bluster in terms of what they're trying to do.</p><p>I mean what is surprising is that their foreign minister is in this country  Sharif -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday and giving  him a stage to create a propaganda move, you know, in terms of his position  on the nuclear deal.</p><p>Anyway -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- I think there will be substantive discussions today.  The  President is not going to budge on trying to get this deal fixed.  I'm  hoping that Pompeo gets confirmed here pretty quick -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- so he can get his head into the negotiations with the Europeans.   He may be able to achieve something that our other diplomats have not been  able to achieve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he cleared that key hurdle yesterday in the confirmation  for secretary of state making it pass the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee last night.  The Senate now expected to approve the director  after he earned the support of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>General Keane -- this is a big relief for the administration given what's  going on in the world today, from North Korea to Iran, ISIS.  We need a  secretary of state in place.  </p><p>KEANE:  There's no doubt about that.  Particularly one that is so  imminently well-qualified as Mike Pompeo.  I mean I've been around him a  few times.  He is really on top of his game and it's not surprising that  President Trump selected him for this key billet inside the administration.</p><p>I think he's the star in this administration.  And he's going to prove his  worth very quickly.  Look what he's got in front of him.  He's got the Iran  deal in front of him and he's got a summit coming up between President  Trump and the North Korean leader.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>KEANE:  So his plate -- his plate is going to be full immediately.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's not forget he just came back from North Korea.  He  actually met with Kim Jong-un already.  The White House opened up yesterday  about President Trump's highly-anticipated meeting coming up with Kim Jong- un.  Here's what was said.  Listen to this -- sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, we're not naive in this  process.  We've seen some steps in the right direction but we have a long  way to go.  We also have seen a major change in what has taken place in the  past by having our allies and partners in the region step up and do much  more than they have in the past.</p><p>China has taken a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.   They can certainly do more.  We hope they will and will continue working  with us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  South Korean President Moon Jae-in expected to meet with his  North Korean counterpart this Friday -- General.  What are you expecting?   What are you watching for in this talk over denuclearization?  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  In some respects that meeting is as important as the one that  President Trump is going to have.  And here's why.  Moon is really to the  left of center and very pro-North Korean by comparison to his predecessors.   We've had leaders like him before but not quite like him.</p><p>I believe Kim Jong-un, who I think is a very shrewd negotiator and  diplomat, is doing everything he can to manipulate Moon.  I think what will  come out of this is an agreement that the Korean War is over and that the  armistice is also over.</p><p>Now what would be wonderful is that months later, those armies that are  facing each other on the border of North and South Korea pulled away.  That  would really be a positive step in the right direction.  Here's the concern  inside -- some people inside South Korea and inside pour administration. </p><p>That Moon really wants reunification as does Kim Jong-un.  And that at some  point, before all the nuclear weapons go away, Moon -- because the war is  over and we know have a treaty that they've signed will make a  recommendation that we pull the United States troops out of South Korea  which would absolutely be a huge disaster.</p><p>So, there's concern about Moon.  There's no concern about President Trump.   And I don't -- and Kim Jong-un knows his negotiations with President Trump   are going to be very tough.  He knows the president's likely going to be  very unbending on giving up the sanctions before he actually gets something  substantive in terms of denuclearization.  But the Moon - Kim Jong-un  Summit, this is worth very keeping an eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's all pretty extraordinary General, isn't it?  Wow.  Good to  see you sir.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure.  General Jack Keane joining us there.  And  coming up in the program, I'll be speaking with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  about his change of heart on Mike Pompeo later this morning.  Join us at  08:30 a.m. Eastern in about an hour, we will speak with Senator Rand Paul.  </p><p>First of all, coming up next, earnings blitz, six Dow components reporting  earnings before the bell this morning, including United Technologies, the  stock is up almost three percent.  On better than expected profit and  revenue.  We break Down those numbers next.  </p><p>Then the champagne pepper sauce.  Tobasco's new limited edition, small  batch hot sauce might cost you as much as a bottle of Bubbly.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday April 24th.   Your top stories right now, 07:30 a.m. East Coast.  Earnings in focus on  Wall Street, six Dow components reporting ahead of the open this morning.   We just heard from Caterpillar beating expectations on both, earnings and  revenue.  The industrial giants also raise its four year outlook.   Caterpillar shares are up almost four percent right now, on earnings of  $2.82 a share, revenue $12.86 billion, again both better than expected.   Stock is up.  3M is down 2.5 percent.  Coca-Cola is up, but Travelers is  down, and United Technologies is up.  We are looking at a rally in the  broader market this morning, as a result of all of this better than  expected earnings.  In fact, right here, this is the high of the morning,  up 160 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average, 2/3 of 1 percent higher.   S&amp;P is also up half a percent and the NASDAQ as well with a 32 point move  right now.  </p><p>This after a mixed day yesterday.  The Dow industrials extended the losing  streak to a fourth session in a row.  The NASDAQ was the worst performer,  it was down a quarter of a percent yesterday.  The Dow was down fraction  but still four days on the losing end.  Checking the global markets this  morning.  European indices are higher.  FT-100 is up almost half a percent,  that's 29 points higher.  CAC Quarante is flat but it's still in positive  territory with a one-point move.  And the DAX Index in Germany, up a third  of a percent, 39 points higher.  In Asia overnight stocks closed mostly  higher.  The Shanghai Composite was the best performer.  It was up just  about two percent in China.  </p><p>Big tech in focus, investors are raising concerns however about Apple.   It's a -- after all a warning of a slowdown in demand for high end  smartphones.  Morgan Stanley taking their estimates down.  We're taking a  closer look ahead of Apple's earnings report on May first.  </p><p>Cooler maker Yeti firing back at the NRA.  Despite cutting ties with the  NRA, Yeti say it fully supports the second amendment. </p><p>And no monkey business when it comes to copyright law.  A court is ruling  this monkey has no rights over its viral selfie.  It actually took a  selfie.  </p><p>OK, Tabasco going high end.  The hot sauce celebrating its 150th  anniversary with a small batch blend.  It's supposed to be good and it is  hot.  Earning split.</p><p>This morning meanwhile, Caterpillar, Jetblue, 3M, Lockheed Martin all  hitting the tape now.  Joining us now to weigh in is Morgan Creek Capital  Management chief executive officer and chief investment officer, Mark  Yusko.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on earnings so far?  We see some numbers this  morning which are pretty good.  </p><p>YUSKO:  They're pretty good.  And I think, you know, there were very lofty  expectations.  And I think that we can come closer and in some cases exceed  and that's a really good sign.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but we're watching Apple ahead of its results on May  first.  We've been talking a lot with Dan Niles from Alpha One.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Told me over the weekend and he thinks Apple's going to miss.   And then yesterday, a company -- a number of chip makers falling last week,  you know.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leading up to chip manufacturers, smartphones, Taiwan  semiconductor, predicting lower than expected sales for hand-held devices.   And then there's this we've got AMS, which is issuing a forecast echoing  the sentiment, Apple's forecast coming in below estimates, reigniting fears  that consumers are losing their appetite for hand-held devices.  What's  going on around Apple right now?  When you're --</p><p>YUSKO:  Look, I think it's a normal cyclical pause.  You know, that the way  semiconductors work is they boom and then they bust and then they boom and  then they bust.  And I think this Taiwan market really is a microcosm for  that.  You can see it just roared last year, and now it's taking a little  pause.  The component manufacturer's coming into the weaker than  expectations.  Because look, everyone's gone through the upgrade cycle.   They bought their 10.  It's OK.  It's not a world-beating phone.  So, I  think Apple will probably come in a little bit light and will have to  regroup.  But long-term the demand for hand-held is not going away.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Well, I think that what's  getting lost in this narrative is actually removing from hand-helds to in- home devices, virtual assistants, if you think about it, it's supposed to  be over 800 million units by 2020 globally.  I think that's pretty telling  you're seeing it take off in China.  So, I think one of the things when it  comes to the semiconductors is that don't they have a long way to go?  I  mean if you think about the autonomous vehicle, if you start to think about  they're used in mining operation, or digital currencies -- I mean where --</p><p>YUSKO:  Favorite thing to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, you know the U.S. dollar and euro are digital currencies  considering only eight percent is actually in print.  But where do you see  semiconductors going from here?  Is the cycle still going to continue to go  -- going on?  Because we see Qualcomm getting in a deal.  I mean, there's a  lot of consolidations in the space.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It's a really an important point.  The semiconductor cycle is just  getting started.  You know, today I think there are three microprocessors  per person on the planet.  There are estimates that in the next 30 years  there could be a thousand.  You know, the internet of things is really  coming sometime around 2024, there are these technological waves.  You  know, 1954 the mainframe, 1968 the microchip, 1982 the personal computer,  96 the internet, 2010 the mobile net, 2024 the internet of things, the  internet of value, cryptocurrencies, secure ties, tokens, all of these  things demand semiconductors.  So, I think you make a really good point.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KINGS COLLEGE:  But  Mark, you know, this internet of things, these home devices, I mean they  rely very heavily on the use of data, slicing data.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  What do we know about you -- how do we customize your  experience.  We're seeing a sort of ground swell change in that.  Does that  affect the long-term picture on these kind of devices?  Where in a world  where we assumed, hey, use data however you want, we don't live in that  world anymore.  </p><p>YUSKO:  It absolutely affects how we're going to use that data.  And the  great thing about blockchain technology is it inverts the ownership of the  data.  If you think about internet protocol, Tim Berners-Lee, not a really  wealthy guy, we use TCP/IP every single day.  But the app developers got  all the benefit because we all -- I don't a Facebook account.  But  everybody puts their data out there and Mark and his guys get rich.   Blockchain flips that upside down and the protocol layer can own the value.   So, if you think about what's going to happen, is we're going to have our  data that we use -- I was on a show yesterday with a guy on Shopin, that  they have your profile.  When you go to a site, not only does it fill in  all the data, so you don't have to fill it in and remember your credit card  number, but then it extracts some of the ad revenue back to your account,  paid in crypto.  Awesome idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Let me -- let me ask you, because when we're talking  about these chip companies, Intel and Qualcomm and AMD are reporting this  week.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see the same upset there that we're seeing that  -- with the anticipation about Apple?  </p><p>YUSKO:  You know, I think we might.  You know, one of the things that  people got ahead of themselves in some of the estimates on the chip makers,  particularly AMD and Nvidia because a lot of them were being used for  mining.  For Bitcoin mining and the theory mining and that did take a  little bit of a dip in the first quarter when prices went down.  Now we're  seeing a recovery in those prices, so I think that will be better for  second quarter.  But you think first quarter could be light.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are raising capital right now for a move into crypto with  security tokens.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, so if you think about the three areas, the Jeff's focused on.   There's cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, things that are store value or  eventually going to be a payment system, they're utility tokens, that's all  the craze about ICO's where you actually don't own the company, you own  some utility function -- like this data for Shopin.  Or then there are  security tokens.  If you think of everything of value, this building we're  sitting in, a house or the plaza hotel, everything can be tokenized and we  go from the age of paper ownership, physical securities, to digital owners  -- to electronic ownership, blips on a screen to true digital ownership.   And that trend is massive.  And every year, 14 trillion, with a t, trillion  dollars of real goods transfer ownership.  And that's all going to be  digitized.  So, we want to raise funds to invest or help institutional  investors invest in the security tokens.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Where are you on that?  How much have you raised?  </p><p>YUSKO:  We just announced -- we just announced -- we acquired a team and  we're going to go out, start raising that fund here in the next little bit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are you going to -- are you going to buy bitcoin or are you  going to buy token?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, not crypto, tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>YUSKO:  So, not crypto.  Not utility tokens, security tokens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  You've got a big educational job ahead of you I think, to help  people understand --</p><p>YUSKO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- the difference and why -- I mean, this world of privacy  concerns.  This could be a real answer, but people have to get it, right?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, look, cryptocurrency I really do think is the future of money,  so the internet of money.  And if you think about what voice over I.P. or  the internet did for information and commerce, right.  We transfer  everything over internet protocol, this is just transferring money over  internet protocol.  If I want to give you money, I don't need a trusted  third party.  I don't need a bank to tell that we did that.  Once it's on  the chain, it's immutable, it's permanent.  We can do that.  Not good news  for banks.  That's why the banks hate blockchain and bitcoin.  But then you  think about utility tokens, there's a very interesting business there about  having a social network, have a coin that we can use for rewarding you, for  adding data to a social network but security tokens is the big opportunity.   That is true digital ownership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You play -- you still like stocks here or no?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last time you were pretty cautious.  You were saying maybe you  want to sell into some of this.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, we were cautious.  And what you've seen since January 26th --  we talked about this, this is distribution.  Every day the last half hour,  the institutional money was selling and selling hard into the close.  And  we've been going down really since January.  The last two days,  interesting, Friday and yesterday, the last half hour there was some  buying.  So I'm cautiously optimistic that maybe the distribution selling  is over and if earnings do come in higher than expected, we could maybe see  a little rally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll watch that.  Mark, good to see you.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks for having me, always fun to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Mark Yusko there.</p><p>Coming up, monkey see, monkey sue.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now this, Yeti is defending its second amendment stance after  an NRA e-mail.  Cheryl Casone with the details now with headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, you know Yeti that make  those coolers -- those drink coolers.  Well their commonly NRA's claim in  accurate.  After an NRA lobbyist sent an e-mail that the company has ceased  doing business with the NRA station.  So, the cooler maker has issued a  statement saying in part \"We were eliminating a group of outdated  discounting programs when we notified the NRA Foundation and the other  organizations about this change.  Yeti explained that we were offeing them  an alternative customization program broadly available to several consumers  and other organization.  So, we'll think about back and forth with those  two.</p><p>Well, an appeals court put an end to the monkey business over this monkey's  selfie.  It's famous.  It was taken back in 2011.  But a legal battle  ensued over if animals can own copyrights.  PETA argued in court that all  profits the photograph makes should belong to Naruto the monkey, since he  held the camera and he did snapped the photo.  Unfortunately for Naruto, he  won't be going on any banana shopping sprees.  The judges upheld the lower  court ruling in favor of yes, the photographer.  Only humans can file  copyright suits.  There you go.</p><p>And (INAUDIBLE), Tabasco is celebrating 150 years in business.  And they've  got a new sauce.  McIlhenny which makes Tabasco is releasing a limited- edition diamond reserve pepper sauce, it comes in a champagne style bottle.   The price is kind of champagne-isk, I guess, $35 for 6-ounces.  Supplies  are limited.  Or maybe a nice bottle of Prosecco .  I can't decide.  I'm  back and forth on this one.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a lot of money for Tabasco, I sort of like it.  </p><p>KELLY:  You like Prosecco, get some Tobasco.  You can have it all Cheryl.   You don't need to choose one or the other.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Can you eat Tabasco?  Out of a bottle that looks like champagne?  </p><p>KELLY:  No, you pour it on.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I know.  But like, it doesn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  it better be good.  </p><p>BRENERG:  I will.  I'm going to get that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am going to get it.  Because they look good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should -- maybe Hillary  Clinton can weigh in.  She's kind of the hot sauce lady.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She carries hot sauce in her purse.  Maybe she can tell us if  it's good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  All right, well take a break.  When we come back,  an American success story, how two brothers turned their Connecticut based  clothing company into a big business.  I'll talk to the founders of  Vineyard Vines coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, at a time that retailers are struggling,  one clothing brand is growing like a vine.  The Connecticut based Vineyard  Vines started in 1998 by two brothers selling ties, now has 95 stores  across the nation.  The brand is also sold in stores like Nordstrom and  Bloomingdales.  Joining me right now are Shep Murray, Vineyard Vines co- founder and CEO and Ian Murray, Vineyard Vines co-founder and CEO.  Good to  see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SHEP MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Thanks, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've been following the company for a lot of years.  And  I've seen how you've grown it.  Talk to us about how you started this and  why you left your desk jobs to go into retail like this?</p><p>S. MURRAY:  Well go.  </p><p>IAN MURRAY, CO-FOUNDERS AND CEO, VINEYARD VINES:  Well, sure.  We were  working down the street in Manhattan and we didn't like our jobs.  We were  young.  I was 23, Shep was 27.  And we decided that we could make neckties  to sell to everyone who goes to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket for the  weekend and it comes back to the floor for the stock exchange.  And once  the -- they can't wear t-shirts.  So, they wear the ones that represents  Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How tough was it?  I mean to really -- you had an idea but you  had to put it into practice.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  Yes, I think the idea was to bring the good life to work with  you and in a time when casual workplace was at its height, everyone was  wearing black mock turtlenecks and all that sort of stuffs, the idea was to  bring the good life to work and kind of our company mantra, is every day  should feel this good.  And so, you know, right now, it's all about make  America great again.  We wanted to make clothing fun again.  And so, that's  what we did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I love the symbol of the whale.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  It's pretty fun.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  We grew up, our father actually carved wooden whales over our  doors.  So, that's how we got our logo.  And our customer early on was a  guy who wore Nantucket red shorts and a faded blue polo shirt.  So, that's  how we get the pink and blue color.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I love it.  But I mean, you had to actually get the  funding.  You had to get access to credit.  How easy or tough was that in  terms of creating this business?  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  I mean, well what happened was we had this idea and we were --  I have spent a couple years working on the New York stock exchange.  We  were big followers of you in your past job and Ian was working at a P.R.  Agency.  Then, I went to work for Madison Avenue.  And we were like, we  didn't want our bosses job.  And so, we had nothing to lose by going out on  our own and starting this.  So, 20 years later with a credit card cash  advance of $8,000, we have all these stores and an amazing, amazing team  who help us live every day should feel this good and we still own 100  percent of the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  So, we're celebrating 20 years now.  But we just wrote credit  card checks to ourselves.  We totaled about $7,000 or $8,000.  We bought a  couple hundred ties that we figured out how to make.  And we sold them, we  kept reinvesting the profits in the business and here we are 20 years  later.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's it's incredible.  That is an incredible sport.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, it's crazy.  It's the American dream.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- I mean, it really is the American dream.  But I  mean, in terms of the access to credit, you didn't need it.  You just --  you did it yourself.  You're getting advances on the credit card.</p><p>I. MURRAY:  Yes, and over the years, we've been working with a number of  different banks.  We've worked with JP Morgan our lead bank and they've  been fantastic and helping us grow.  And giving us some resources, but we  still have all the equity.  And we've got a little over 100 stores now  throughout the country.  And we work with all sorts of great organizations  that we never thought we'd have the opportunity to work with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the -- is th next move to take it public?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  I don't know about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about an Amazon economy?  Tell me about that.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you've got companies and stores going out of business  left and right because of the Amazon that's going on.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  One of the beauties about being privately held, is we're able  to put the gas on and off when we want.  Amazon is amazing.  We're huge  fans of what Jeff has done.  And you know, we're big Amazon customers.   What we want to do and what we think our customer is looking for is a  better experience.  Amazon's a great marketplace.  But when you go into our  stores and you meet our customers and you get to touch and feel the product  and you see the packaging we provide and all of the other cool lifestyle  stuff that we do, we believe that there's a place for Amazon and brands.   And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, the packaging is a big deal.  How do you grow it  from here?  I mean, you've got these ties that you brought in to show off.   But I see we have a whole rack of dresses and -- I mean, what's the next  step in terms of growth?  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  Sure.  I mean, I think one of the things we're really having a  lot of fun with is joining our customers, the community that follow  Vineyard Vines with other passions in their life.  We're really excited, we  just announced that we're going to be the official style of the Boston Red  Sox and Fenway Park.  But we're also the official style of the Kentucky  Derby, the America's Cup, we launched a partnership.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic, getting into sports.  I love it.  </p><p>S. MURRAY:  We just do kind of fun things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Ian, Shep.  Shep, Ian, great to see you both.  </p><p>I. MURRAY:  All right, thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations.  Vineyard Vines.

Thank you so much and happy Tuesday everybody.  Good  morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A Blue Chip earnings blitz, six Dow components all due out before the  opening bell this morning including Coca Cola, Verizon, Caterpillar among  others.  Futures this morning looking good, indicating a higher opening for  the broader averages this morning.  We're expecting the Dow Industrials to  be up about 100 points right out of the gate, NASDAQ to be up about 34  points right after the gate this morning.  We are covering the earnings  blitz.</p><p>Alphabet meeting expectations on both profit and revenue last night.   Shares of Google's parent company up three percent in after hours trading  but a spike in expenses temper the initial excitement.  The stock is up  two-thirds of a percent.  Also talking about the company raising its value  in its stake in Uber, that also made the earnings look better than  expected.  Dan Niles predicted what would happen and he was right no  expenses, we're going to talk more about that.  </p><p>Markets closing mostly lower yesterday meanwhile, weighed down by rising  bond yields.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials down 14 points, the S&amp;P was  up a fraction and the NASDAQ down 17.  The Dow down for a fourth session in  a row, that is the longest losing streak since March. </p><p>In Europe this morning, indices look like this, FT-100 is up a third of a  percent, that's 22 points higher.  CAC Quarante is down just a fraction and  the DAX in Germany up 38 points, that is one-third of one percent.  In Asia  overnight, stock closed mostly higher, Shanghai Composite the top performer  up nearly two percent.  </p><p>And then an open book (INAUDIBLE) for the first time, Facebook is revealing  its secret rules for user posts.  Where the company says it crosses the  line.</p><p>Then the Uber of China steps on the gas, the Chinese ride hailing giant  reportedly in talks to go public.  The jaw-dropping valuation for this  company.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney gets jazzed up, the senate hopeful making a scene at  Utah's game against the Thunder.  His hilarious taunt against OKC  Superstar, Russell Westbrook.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The King's College  Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  And Benchmark Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see everybody.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of earnings to talk about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean, this earning season is a pivotal one especially  because everything is really kind of baked in, everybody expects 18 percent  rise on earnings, they expect revenues to be up five percent.  One of the  telling things about earnings season is every sector is suppose to grow and  that hasn't happened since 2014.  So, come to (INAUDIBLE) week of earning  season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure.  Well, I think it's important.  I want to point out  this company AMS, reporting first quarter results.  Now they were OK, the  numbers but the real key here is one of the lines in the press release  says, \"We are seeing a slowdown in sales of smartphones, high-end  smartphones,\" that means AKA Apple.</p><p>So, again, this is -- we're looking at potential slowdown in Apple as Dan  Niles who joined me this weekend on Wall Street said to expect a miss on  Apple.  I wanted to just check AMS because all of the Apple suppliers are  involved in this story and you really see what's to come in terms of the  Apple quarter.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  This is -- I mean, this is so interesting to think this  wave that Apple's been writing for such a long time looks like it's coming  to an end.  This is a company that investors have counted on quarter after  quarter to deliver and now you're looking at their core business, not just  faltering domestically by the way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- this is a global story right now (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  The X10 is not -- just not living up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well people don't want to spend money on it and that's why they  came over to SC editions, you guys remember that?  It was a lower priced  model, they already hit peak sort of luxury sales a couple years ago and  they were always trying to figure out a way how do they get -- get that net  marginal buyer.</p><p>They didn't want to compromise margins, that's something Apple never wants  to do, they want to keep them around 40 percent on the gross margin side.   So, neither they've got to compromise on margins or they've got to  compromised on pricing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned Dan Niles, we said this before the show even  started, Dan Niles got Alphabet, Google right as well in terms of the  expenditures.  There are a lot of -- you see the -- if you look at the  stock this morning for Google, I'm just going to call it Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the symbol is still Goo -- it's still Google.  But,  again, the concern there that will hold back this stock is what are the  regulations going to be on this business?  They don't want to tout their ad  revenue growth a little too much.  By the way, it was up 24 percent, $26.6  billion, that's almost double what Facebook is believed to have generated  an ad revenue for the same period.  </p><p>But they're not going to champion it because, again, there are a lot of  questions that we talk about on his show yesterday of how much of their  data are they abusing?  And how far are they going and continue to generate  this ad revenue?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big story.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big story.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, it's so interesting to watch it because the numbers here  were good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I mean, overall they were very good and yet the market reaction  was, \"Uh, we don't know about the future.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They increased the valuation though of their ownership's stake  in Uber and that also made the numbers look stronger again.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But even backing that out is a good result, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The second quarter I should say.  But the expenses are an  issue, there are some news in there.  So we've got a big show this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman, Texas Congressman Kevin Brady in the studio this  morning.  Foreign Relations Committee Member, Kentucky Senator, Rand Paul  is with us after changing his vote last night and voting for Mike Pompeo.   Former Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee is with us along with former  Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter.  </p><p>Former Hillary Clinton Director of Strategic Communications and Elrod  Strategist President, Adrienne Elrod is here.  And FOX News Senior  Strategic Analyst, Retired General, Four Star General, Jack Keane.  Don't  miss a moment of it, we got a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with a look at Futures, we are expecting a  higher opening for the broader averages.  We're looking at a rally at the  start of trading.  Investors are waiting first quarter results from six Dow  components this morning and if noted a moment ago, we are looking at  overall S&amp;P500 growth in profit of about 19 percent for the first quarter.   That is the estimate.</p><p>United Technologies, Coca Cola, Travelers, Verizon, Caterpillar, and 3M all  reporting before the opening of trading this morning Brian.  This is going  to be a big day.  Obviously, that's going to weigh on markets or influence  markets.  Right now, we're expecting a rally f a hundred.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well -- I mean, it should and it's good to see the market up.  I  mean these numbers have been extraordinarily this quarter.  These are --  what we're talking about decades since we've seen this kind of beat  numbers, companies reported as well and yet markets have been back and  forth.</p><p>It's good to see them up a hundred year because the fundamentals  underlying, those are good.  The problem this week is tech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Tech is such a question mark and I think that's going to rattle  investors just a little bit.  To Dagen's point, because we don't know this  Alphabet question, what's happening in the future without these  regulations?</p><p>KELLY:  Well they do.  Yes, you know the question in a month from now, the  European regulators are going to come in and they're going to implement  their protection rules and it's, what are the U.S. regulators going to do  behind it?  Google --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Google had said we're -- we've been -- 18 months we've been  reading.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they've been doing it for 18 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they beat the numbers, the technology giant, Google's parent  Alphabet, they beat the numbers yesterday, they reported earnings of $13.33  a share on revenue of $31.5 billion in revenue.</p><p>Here's what Alpha One Capital Partners Dan Niles accurately predicted would  be the big issue ahead of this report.  Listen to this, hear what he's  saying last week on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  The problem with  Google is the exact opposite as with Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided  expenses up 45 to 60 percent this year before this data breach stuff ever  happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't (INAUDIBLE) but Wall Street has expenses  modeled so that -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I  think the expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  There you go.  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been -- let me -- so they spent a record $7.3 billion in  the first-quarter, nearly triple what the company spent a year ago, triple.   Now some of that, almost $2.5 billion of that was buying the Chelsea Market  here in New York City but they added 5,000 employees including 2,000 that's  -- that came from the purchase of HTC's mobile, a handset design operation.</p><p>But, again, it -- if this is going to be a headwind for the company,  regulation, how much more ad revenue can they continue to squeeze out of  people now who are concerned about their privacy and the expenditure.</p><p>KELLY:  Well just real quick on what Dan is saying, Dan hit the nail on the  head and one of the reasons you can tell is because traffic acquisition  cost were up 36 percent and last quarter, Google actually said it was going  to be down.  </p><p>So that's why the stock sold off initially when they released earnings.   And now it's up in the premarket because the Asian markets are up.  So it's  not actually off of their own earnings --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>KELLY:  -- it's because general market sentiment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, the stock wasn't even up this year.  It was up  barely two percent.  It was trading in a pretty reasonable valuation for  tech.</p><p>KELLY:  Well one of the reasons why they spent so much money on that  Chelsea Market, over $2 billion is because their biggest competitor in the  advertising space, Amazon bought another building in midtown and they're  going to be leading the way in the advertising revolution, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well look, I mean the stock is obviously going to be big  volume today as well.  Then there's Facebook opening up about the secret  guidelines today on how they actually police content while introducing a  new appeals process for users who are found in violation of Facebook's  \"standards.\"  </p><p>The Silicon Valley titan is also revealing and increase the number of  content reviewers by 40 percent year-over-year, Dagen, what do you think  about this one?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could sum up some of their policies in a couple sentences, if  you're prolife and pro second amendment, your content gets banned on  Facebook.  I've had friends that experience that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is horrible.  That is exactly the things that Congress is  zeroing in on.  You cannot control what the rest of us see and what we  don't see and that's what some of these companies are doing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they're about community, whether they're about building a  community as long as you agree with what the people running the company  believe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not right.  It's not right at all.  And let me tell you,  that is going to be a big issue for this company in terms of regulators.</p><p>We want to turn now to the deadly van attack in Toronto, Canada where 10  people are now dead.  Molly Line, she's live in Toronto right now with the  very latest, Molly.</p><p>MOLLY LINE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, we're just to the side of Young  Street, this is where the incident that ultimately unfolded, it has been  blocked off here, secured as investigators comb over the scene.  They  expect to be here for days.</p><p>It's pretty extensive scene, it goes on for several long blocks.   Meanwhile, investigators not sharing any possible motive at this point in  time for the attack, they do have a man in custody, he's the man that  allegedly rammed that white rental van into a multitude of pedestrians  identified as Alek Minassian, a 25-year-old from Toronto suburb of Richmond  Hill,  15 lives were claimed, at least 15 people injured, the brutal force  of the large van leaving some dead at the scene, others fighting for their  lives at nearby hospitals with severe wounds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He just went on the sidewalk, he just started hitting  everybody man.  The bus stop, everything all shattered.  Because a lot of  people got hurt, I've seen a scene I've never seen in my life. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINE:  The van with extensive front-end damage and bearing a logo for rider  truck rentals finally stopped and video captured at the scene showed the  driver being taken into custody.  American leaders have expressed  solidarity.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence tweeted yesterday, \"POTUS and I are closely  monitoring the attack on innocent people in Toronto this afternoon.  We are  with the Canadian people tonight as they grieve the loss of life and  injured.  The American people stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our neighbors  in Canada.\" </p><p>Meanwhile, back in New York, counterterrorism officers have fanned out the  key sites of the city but they cautioned at this point in time there is,  \"No known nexus to New York City.\"  Ralph Goodale, the Minister of Public  Safety here in Canada says there's no known national security link based on  the information they have thus far in this investigation.  Miniassian is  expected in court later on this morning where we should get further  information about the charges he will face, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Molly, thank you so much.  Molly Line, we'll check  back as new information because available.</p><p>Coming up, the nation prays for 41 this morning, George H.W. Bush is in the  hospital just days after laying his wife to rest.  We will get an update on  the former president's condition.  </p><p>And then China's largest ride hailing company reportedly hitting the gas on  an IPO, more on the time table and what this could mean for Uber's plans to  go public, back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are learning more about the suspected Waffle  House killer.  He's now under a rest, his father could be in trouble,  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning Maria.  The story  keeps unfolding.  Police found 29-year-old Travis Reinking in a wooded area  near the scene where he's accused of shooting and killing four people.</p><p>Now his father though could be facing charges for giving him several guns,  some of which were taken by police when he was arrested last year near the  White House.  So this includes the IR15 that was used in the Waffle House  shooting, separate gun, separate incident.  But remember, the shooting  rampage was eventually stopped by hero customer James Shaw, Jr.  </p><p>He appeared on Fox and Friends first this morning.  Not only is Shaw a  hero, he started a Go Fund Me page to raise money for the victim's  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  I just want to give them a small  gesture.  The money is not going to make up for the life but at least  there's something to move them in the right way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  So far, Shaw has raised more than $77,000 for those victims.  </p><p>Well, former President George H.W. Bush has been hospitalized one day after  the funeral for his wife Barbara.  According to Houston Methodist Hospital  the 93-year-old Bush is being treated for an infection that has spread to  his blood.  A spokesman says Bush is responding to treatment and he appears  to be recovering.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there is a petition to fire a Fresno State University professor  who called the late Barbara Bush an amazing racist.  That has no reached  more than 10,000 signatures to have her fired.  Randa Jarrar also boasting  she could never be fired for her comments as (INAUDIBLE) professor.  Jarrar  is now under internal investigation by the university.</p><p>Well, a year and a half after Wells Fargo's fake account scandal, people  are still very angry.  Mass protests are expected at the Wells Fargo annual  shareholder to the meeting today in Democrats Moines, Iowa.  Wells Fargo is  facing a $1 billion fine for opening millions of fake accounts.  The  president and CEO Tim Sloan will hear from shareholders and customers at  the meeting about how Wells Fargo can maybe regain the public's trust.   Chang of Well fargo down nearly 13 percent so far this year.  </p><p>And Maria, those are your headlines this morning.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thank you so much.  Coming up, Rand's  reversal, Senator Rand Paul's change of heart and giving Mike Pompeo a  boost to clear full Senate confirmation for the Secretary of State  position.  More on the last minute deal coming up, we will speak with Rand  Paul as well later on the program.</p><p>And then old flames and new worries about data safety, the match.com glitch  that might leave some people have a lot of explaining to do.  Back in a  moment right here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS -- road we're in and need a strong Secretary of  State in place and so the democrats don't play politics with national  security appointments but instead confirm Mike Pompeo to this position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz with me yesterday  throwing his support behind President Trump's nominee for Secretary of  State, Mike Pompeo in an interview on Fox News about 4:00 yesterday.</p><p>Pompeo advanced yesterday with a favorable recommendation from the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee after republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul  changed his mind and his vote.  Joining us now and talk more about that is  former Presidential Candidate himself, former republican Arkansas Governor,  Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you sir.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.   Great to be with you today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised with what took place last night?  Basically  Rand Paul saying, \"Look, I had a conversation with the president, I believe  now that Mike Pompeo agrees with the president and with me to lessen the  entitlement across the world, what's your take?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well a couple of things, first of all, Rand Paul is a principle  guy, there were some things he was uncomfortable with until he come around.   The second thing about it is when he's on your show later today.  Notice  that he is -- his arm is in a cast, Donald Trump broke it twisting  yesterday.</p><p>But the point is Mike Pompeo is going to be confirmed as Secretary of  State.  He should have made this just sliding through this is an absurdity.   If the democrats want to pick some fights, this was a dumb on the pick.   Take a look at after somebody who has his pedigree, his experience, and  frankly already having sat down with North Korea and stands in a position  to do some extraordinary things.  They shouldn't fight everything because  then nothing they do has any credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's not forget what he just did, he just went all the  way to North Korea and met with Kim Jong-un.  It's a good point and I'm  glad you brought it up, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out,  they call out Jeff Merkley, the democrat from Oregon saying that a vote for  Mike Pompeo is a vote for Trump's war cabinet.</p><p>Well guess what, Mike Pompeo is nominated to be the chief diplomat.  So  what -- how do you fight potential war with diplomacy?  So I think that  some of these senators need to go back to school a little bit on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was a very important symbolic moment for the republicans.   You did not want to be where the republicans still in control of the  Senate, the republicans having the majority on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, 11 to 10 to be the first time since at least 1925 that the  Secretary of State nominee didn't get a favorable vote coming out of the  Senate Foreign Relations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would have been a slap in the face of American people who  voted for these republican senators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially with what's going on right now.  You know  Governor, my favorite line from Lindsey Graham yesterday was, \"You might be  sick of fighting with these extremists but guess what, they're not tired of  fighting with you.\"  And so this is the reality that we face.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Lindsey Graham said yesterday.  Another is, \"We've  got to keep this up and we've got to keep the troops in Syria over the  near-term because they're not tired of fighting with us.\"</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There are a lot of republicans who are not that fund of Donald  Trump and I get that but they've got to remember that under the  constitution, when he's elected president, he has every right to pick his  own cabinet and staff.  And unless they can find something morally  objectionable or outrageously unacceptable, they should give the president  the people that he wants to be in his cabinet.</p><p>The republicans did that for John Kerry, for Hillary Clinton, I doubt that  a lot of who voted 94 by the way votes in the Senate on both Kerry and  Clinton, I'm sure there were a lot of republicans who held their nose and  did it.  But they looked at the constitution and they said, \"Whether we  like it or not, Obama's president, he has a right to pick his Secretary of  State.\"  I just don't understand who these democrats look into a camera  which they love to do but look into a camera and explain, \"Oh Mike Pompeo,  I can't vote for him because he has views about same sex marriage or maybe  views about abortion\" which has nothing to do with being Secretary of  State.  That's an absurdity and I think they had embarrassed themselves.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are three democrat senators who come out and said that  they will vote in favor of Mike Pompeo to be the Secretary of State.  And  correct me if I'm wrong, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Mansion in West Virginia, and  then Joe Donnelly, so those are the three so far.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's correct.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But Governor, you do have at least four who voted to confirm him  as director of CIA who said they will not vote for him for this position.   And I think you hit it exactly right, they're talking about issues that  have nothing to do with foreign policy, the job of a Secretary of State.   How do you defend the critique of Pompeo on those grounds when that had  nothing to do with his job?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, again, it's just a stretch.  They don't have anything, so  they make something up.  They'd be better off bringing James Taylor into  the Senate Chamber and let him sing, \"You've Got a Friend\" and I'll have a  big bear hug. </p><p>That would make a lot more sense in what they're doing.  I think they're  hurting themselves for the midterms but as somebody who hopes republicans  hangs on to both Houses, I can only hope that they continue to act this  foolishly when it comes to the president's appointments especially in light  of the fact that he's got this extraordinary relationship with the  president of France whose got North Korea coming to the table.  Those are  some pretty big things happening right now on the national security front.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, really big things actually.  Well let me turn to border  security Governor, a caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants  arriving at the U.S. border, the pictures are incredible.</p><p>President Trump tweeted on the matter yesterday, here's what he wrote,  \"Despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border  being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland  Security not to let these large caravans of people into our country.  It is  a disgrace.  We are the only country in the world so na[ve.  Wall.\"</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen issued a statement reinforcing  U.S. immigration law.  She said, \"If you enter the United States illegally,  let me be clear, you have broken the law and we will enforce the law  through prosecution of illegal border crosser.\"  Governor, your take on  this.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's no doubt that one of the reasons, one of the big reasons  Donald Trump is sitting in the White House today is because of his position  on immigration.  It's not that Americans are anti-immigrant but their --  but what they are is they're anti-breaking the law and getting away with it  and they're tired of it.</p><p>And what they want is if there are people who legitimately need asylum,  Americans have big hearts, they're -- they understand but they're not  willing to just open the gates and say, \"Come on in everybody, we've got  benefits including welfare and medical care\" that's just not where this  country is right now and it frankly shouldn't be.  We have no idea who the  people are in those caravans, so they've got to be vetted, they've got to  be carefully screened and that's what president is asking for but it's got  the American people demand.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Governor, do you think we'll get anything done when it comes  to immigration policy this year, vis-a-vis DACA or any other plans?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We could if the democrats really believed in it but they don't  and they've shown they don't.  The president laid more on the table than I  ever thought h would lay on the table more than any republican ever wanted  to lay on the table.  </p><p>But he did it basically I think to say, \"We're not against immigration  reform, we're just wanting to do it in a context of law.\"  Now the  democrats walked away from going this point of saying, \"This is the most  important thing we have to deal with and the deadline is looming to, \"Oh,  never mind.\"  I'm just amazed that they can do this with such a (INAUDIBLE)  just indifference to the causes they claimed to champion, they really don't  stand for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Governor, good to see you  sir, thanks so much for weighing in.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Good to talk to you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, analysts are watching to see if the new look diet coke gives  Coca Cola the pop it needs in first quarter earnings, the Dow Blue Chip  reports earnings before the bell, we will have the numbers as soon as they  come out and see how it's impacting markets.</p><p>And then there's this, Mitt Romney, Senate candidate and a smack talker?   The former presidential candidate with some courtside taunts during the  Utah Jazz playoff game last night, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 24th, your  top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are looking to  rebound, take a look, Futures indicating a rally right at the start of  trading, up 140 points on the Dow, 15 on S&amp;P, and 48 points higher on the  NASDAQ, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Driving the sentiment earnings, once again, it is the busiest week for  earnings season, this week.  Today, alone, six Dow Components will report  their first-quarter.  Among the names to watch, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and  Verizon, may very well mean market movers.  This after a mixed day  yesterday, the Dow extended its losing streak to a fourth session.  The  technology heavy, NASDAQ, the worst performer, down a quarter of a percent  yesterday, 17 points lower.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, check the action in Europe, FT-100 is up 25, a  third of a percent, CAC Quarante is flat on the session in Paris, and the  DAX Index in Germany, up one third of a percent, 50 points higher.  In Asia  overnight, stocks closed mostly higher, with the exception of Korea.  The  Hang Seng was higher by one and a quarter percent, but it was the Shanghai  in China, the top performer, up almost two percent.</p><p>Lawmakers speaking out over the Russia investigation, Senator Ted Cruz,  taking aim at the special counsel and possible bias at the top of key  enforcement agencies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRUZ:  The Department of Justice, the Special Counsel, should not become a  partisan fishing expedition.  Listen, I think it's very troubling that Bob  Mueller has appointed a number of lawyers to his team, who are partisan  Democrats who repeatedly have been Democratic donors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of that criticism and the latest on the probe, coming up  this morning.  Plus, another Chinese giants looking to make its way on Wall  Street, the Wall Street Journal reporting the country's top rival to Uber,  is eyeing an IPO with an eye-popping valuation.  Data concerns now hitting  match.com, a glitch reactivates old accounts.  We've got the details on the  impact.  </p><p>And then, Mitt Romney, from senate candidate to top Hitler, his talks  against Russell Westbrook, going viral, all that, coming up this Tuesday  morning but first, lawmakers are speaking out this morning over the Special  Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.  Yesterday, Senator Ted Cruz  outlined his concerns about the investigation, when I spoke with him on Fox  News, in the afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRUZ:  The Department of Justice, the Special Counsel, should not become a  partisan fishing expedition.  Listen, I think it's very troubling that Bob  Mueller has appointed a number of lawyers to his team, who are partisan  Democrats, who repeatedly been Democratic donors.  In my view, the  Department of Justice and the FBI, that they should be beyond reproach,  they have a long bipartisan tradition of staying out of politics and when  you see partisan text back and forth, when you see partisan Democratic  donors in a grill in the investigation, that rises very serious questions  about fairness and impartiality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the Former Director of Strategic  Communications for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and President of  Elrod Strategies, Adrienne Elrod, along with Former Special Assistant to  President Trump and Former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc  Lotter.  Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Good  morning.</p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, PRESIDENT, ELROD STRATEGIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, let me ask you, what do you think of when you -- what  do you say when you hear all about this bias at the top of the FBI, the  bias at the top of the Department of Justice during the presidential  election where they were very favorable toward Hillary Clinton and,  basically, created this narrative against Donald Trump.  What's your take  on it?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I won't exactly say that they were favorable toward Hillary  Clinton because I strongly believe it.  Comey, reopening the investigation  12 days before the campaign is why we lost, the primary reason why we lost.   But, look, I think these comments by Senator Cruz are disturbing and yet  another example of Republicans trying to undermine the credibility of  Robert Mueller in the investigation.  That's exactly why we need this  bipartisan bill that Democrats and Republicans are pushing in congress,  allowed to come to the floor, so that Bob Mueller will be protected from  being fired by Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, but, Adrienne, actually, when you look at what took  place, Jim Comey wrote an exoneration letter for Hillary Clinton even  before he did the interview.  When she did the interview with the FBI, it  wasn't recorded, it wasn't on the record, we saw all the texts from Peter  Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page, where they wanted an insurance policy  and now we know from the Chairman of the Intel Committee that, in fact,  there was no official intelligence used to launch an attack on Donald Trump  and an investigation on Donald Trump  So to me, it looks like the collusion  was with Hillary Clinton and the FBI, actually.</p><p>ELROD:  No.  I completely and respectfully disagree, Maria.  Let's also  remember that Strzok and Page were both immediately removed from this  committee when --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they still work there.  They actually still work at the FBI  and they have security clearances, still.  They still are there.</p><p>ELROD:  By the Special Counsel.  They were removed from being a part of the  investigation and the Special Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc Lotter, how do you see it?</p><p>LOTTER:  I agree with you, Maria, I mean, there are some very disturbing  things that have taken place by a very small handful of people at the top  of the FBI and the Justice Department and the former administration, but  those things are being looked at right now by the inspector general.   There's been a criminal referral possibly involving former Deputy Director  of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, for the way he was conducting himself during  that time period.  </p><p>So, there are very serious concerns.  But once again, the White House has  said over and over and over again, including yesterday.  There has been no  discussion about firing Director Mueller and that's why Senator McConnell  is saying that this bill that protects him is just nothing more than a  political sham like their lawsuit from the Democratic National Committee,  just trying to keep the Russian narrative alive when there is absolutely no  there, there.</p><p>KELLY:  Hey, Adrienne, it's Kevin Kelly, one of the questions I have is do  you think Democrats are going to, sort of, keep this narrative up through  the election and then hopefully, when the 2018 elections are over, everyone  will, sort of, move on and hopefully, Mueller will, kind of, wind down his  investigation or do you see it ramping up and then dogging the Trump  presidency for the remaining few years?</p><p>ELROD:  Well, I think the Democrats, look, going into 2018 and beyond, I  mean, it's kind of irrelevant from the actual midterm.  Doing everything we  can to protect the Mueller investigation.  It is incredibly important that  Robert Mueller be able to carry on his investigation with integrity,  without any, sort of, undue influence from the administration.  I think  that's what we're focused on doing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is a -- that is a bill  or a cockamamie idea cooked up because people hate Trump, about this bill  to prevent him from furrowing Bob Mueller.  In fact, if you look at it,  it's unconstitutional.  It takes the power of the executive branch and  tries to hand it to somebody else or another part of the government.   Antonin Scalia will be screaming to the high heavens where he is right now,  if he was still on planet earth about this.  And that is why Mitch  McConnell has said he's not -- he' not going to touch it, essentially, that  he is not going to bring the bill up for a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, you got two GOP chairman striking a deal with the  Department of Justice for documents tied to the FBI investigation and to  Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.  The joint statement from  Congressman Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy, reads in part this, we look  forward to reviewing the information to better understand the decisions  made by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017.  Congress has a  constitutional responsibility to preserve the integrity of our justice  system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken.   Adrienne, how do you see that?</p><p>ELROD:  I mean, I see this is -- you know, why are we spending time on this  anymore, I mean, the case closed situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's obstruction, because it's obstruction of justice.</p><p>ELROD:  It was closed -- it was closed before the campaign, it was closed  before the midterms.  You know, look, if Goodlatte and Gowdy want to focus  their time on this, fine.  But I frankly think it is a waste of their time.   I think it's a waste of taxpayer dollars and I think it's a waste of the  Department of Justice's time to produce these documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let me ask you this, I mean, were you there when the DNC  got hacked?</p><p>ELROD:  I was.  I was on Hillary Clinton's campaign when this happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what was the answer for her not giving the servers to the  FBI?  Why would she not give the server?  I mean, you're the DNC, you get  hacked, all your e-mails are out there in the public view.  Why wouldn't  you want the strength and the power and the might of the FBI to figure out  exactly who hacked you and what went on?  Why not give up servers?  And why  hire private company so that the servers are kept away from the FBI? </p><p>ELROD:  Well, look, I think, she has a lot of reasons for not turning over  the servers to the FBI --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the reason?</p><p>ELROD:  She produced all the e-mails that were asked and those e-mails were  investigated and it was determined by the FBI, and by the Department of  Justice to Hillary Clinton, I did not do anything wrong and she apologized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>ELROD:  But again -- but again, this was in -- this was in 2016, case  closed.  I think there's another way for Republicans to continue to try to  distract from the problems that they are facing at the party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, actually, it was the Democrats that are distracted,  Adrienne, let's be clear.  They didn't give up the server after they were  hacked, and instead, they brought in a private company to investigate the  server rather than giving it to the FBI.  That's where the obstruction lies  right now and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier along with the DNC which  was used to wiretap a member of Donald Trump's team.  That, we know for a  fact, Adrienne.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, we also admit there's a lot of information on the dossier  that has been independently corroborated by the FBI and the Special  Counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Actually, it's unverified.  This was all unverified in the  dossier.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, again, let's let the Mueller investigation play out.  Let's  let it play out, Maria, let's let it play out.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Marc, if you want the Mueller investigation to play out,  shouldn't you also want this investigation to play out?  I mean, why so  much concern about one happening and the other closing up quickly, don't we  need both?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I mean, it's typical, I mean, Democrats want a double  standard, they don't want to go back and look at the things they did with  their collusion with the fact that, Loretta Lynch, according to Jim Comey's  book, may have been compromised and that's why he took the steps that he  took in the -- in the entire situation.  There's a lot of information that  needs to be uncovered here, and, I think, that's where we're going to see  congress continue to look into it.  </p><p>The Inspector General is still looking into the actions that took place at  the FBI, at the Department of Justice.  And we just need to get all of this  information out in public and get it behind us.  We've got too many good  things going on in this country from an economic standpoint, to the way of  our standing on the world stage over the leadership of President Trump.  We  don't need to be going back and always rehashing this.  Let's talk about  the great things that are happening right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is this agreement that Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte  have engineered with the Justice Department, Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, it sounds to me that they're going to go back and get a lot  of the documents that have not been turned over yet, as it may relate to  communications and other documents during that time period.  And so, since  they are investigatory documents, sometimes, obviously, there are some  issues there, there may be some classifications, but it's great that  they're -- that they're working with the Department of Justice.  We're  going to put the politics behind us on this.  And let's just get the  information out there, let the American people decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Adrienne Elrod, Marc  Lotter, good to see you both.  Thank you very much --</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>ELROD:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  for weighing in on all of this.  By the way, the President has  said (INAUDIBLE) he's not going to fire Robert Mueller.  So I don't know  why, you know, this question keeps coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the, media, every time that he is near a microphone,  people are shouting the question at him, are you going to fire Bob Mueller?   Are you going to fire Bob Mueller?  So this is an idea, looking at it from  my perspective, they are goading him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It says if members of the media are goading him to fire Bob  Mueller.  And it's -- you know what it had?  It's a narrative that's  basically concocted by people --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Muddy the waters.  Keep money in the waters.  All right, coming  up, China's largest ride-hailing company, reportedly revving up its IPO  plans, the jaw-dropping valuation for the company, coming up.  And then  Krispy Kreme celebrates spring with a limited-edition donut, but you have  to act fast for this tasty treat.  Plus, two big interviews, coming up,  Senator Rand Paul and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady,  join me later on in the program.  Back in a moment, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news overnight, a major Chinese ride  hailing company reportedly gears up for a multibillion-dollar IPO.  Cheryl  Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Multi-billion, Maria.  Get this, the Wall Street Journal says the  DiDi Chuxing is in talks with bankers about going public; possible  valuation up to $80 billion.  The offering could happen as soon as this  year, and that cash will be used for DiDi to expand internationally.  If  this company went public, DiDi would beat rival Uber to the public markets.  </p><p>Privacy concerns hitting Match.com users after a glitch re-activated some  old accounts.  And while the company maintained, it was a limited number of  accounts, their current privacy statements says that the company can retain  certain information associated with your account even after you close it,  even if you get married, have children, there you go.  Old accounts are  reactivated if you see a password reset e-mail for Match, you don't have an  account any more there were go.  Match landed in 1995, they're now  available in 25 countries.  Shares of match grew; actually, up about 50  percent so far this year.  </p><p>OK, Maria, you may remember we reported on this, there was a big contest to  name the next Krispy Kreme donut flavor.  A lot of strong opinion on set  that day.  Two million votes came in and the winner is lemon glaze.  Lemon  beat out blueberry, caramel, and maple.  I know -- I wanted maple.  The new  donut goes on sale today; only for a week -- whatever, Krispy Kreme.  It's  only available through Sunday.  I forgot who wanted lemon.  I was voting  for maple, but there was a lot of back and forth on that one.    BARTIROMO:  You wanted lemon.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Lemon is the rightful winner here.  There's nothing better on a  donut than lemon glaze.  </p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Way better than maple.</p><p>KELLY:  Speaking of lemon, talk about Uber, they can't even get their IPO  out, their valuations gone to $46 billion.  The Chinese company, they had  to cede control too in China.  Now, valued at 80 billion, can you believe  it?  That's a lemon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will Uber ever go public.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes, yes.  Their CEO has re-affirmed that they are going to go  public in 2019.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got my head on my hands because some the mornings, you just  want to talk about donuts, Kevin.  Some morning --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All business all the time.  That's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, he's our younger brother.  And I just have to  bust your job.  I can't help it.  You're my younger brother too.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  The donut eating and talking younger brother.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You understand the importance of talking about it?</p><p>BRENBERG:  Priorities in life.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but I'm just upset we didn't get maple, that's why, so I had  to pivot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think I'm with you on the maple, by the way.  Coming up,  Mitt Romney's ribbing -- did you see it?  Former presidential candidate  getting into playoff fever last night with courtside tots during the Utah  Jazz playoff game.  And forget sports drinks and shoe endorsements, Steph  Curry has just landed a major entertainment deal.  Sports is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In the NBA Playoffs, the Houston Rockets are  soaring to new heights.  Jared Max with all the details.  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Houston,  Minnesota has a problem.  James Harden pumped the Rocket fuel in the second  quarter like the team have never seen.  Game three Rockets-Timberwolves.   Houston up two games to one.  Harden scores 22 points in the second  quarter, 22 of the Rockets, 50.  One point off the NBA record set 56 years  ago.  For the most points in the playoff quarter, Harden finish with 36,  Rockets win by 19.  They only need one more win to advance Team Wolves  free,  </p><p>Game four in Salt Lake City, between the Jazz and Thunder running for  Senate in Utah.  Former presidential candidate, Massachusetts Governor Mitt  Romney taunting, talking trash to OKC star, Russell Westbrook.  He keeps  holding up his fingers that there's four -- four fouls.  Eventually,  Russell Westbrook gets his fifth foul and the Jazz win by 17.  Donovan  Mitchell's scored 33.  Utah leads three games to one.  </p><p>Veteran Bay Area T.V. sport anchor and one-time 49ers Receiver Mike Shumann  of KGO T.V. in San Francisco allegedly was caught on video last week in San  Antonio appearing to steal a jacket that belonged to the Golden State  Warriors Head of Security, Ralph Walker.  KGO investigating Shumann,  reportedly sent home from NBA Playoff coverage.  </p><p>Move over Lebron James.  You're not the only NBA superstar making waves in  the entertainment world.  Warriors' great Stephen Curry has chosen Sony  Entertainment Pictures after cording with several industry giants to sign  what is described as a wide-ranging multi-year deal, unanimous media --  that's the company that Steph created recently.  Film, television,  electronics gaming, virtual reality, it's all there for Steph whose  production lot will be in Culver City at Sony Pictures -- life after  basketball.  </p><p>On one side, we have Rob Gronkowski, the New England Patriots Tight End.   And on the other, Rob Gronkowski, just Gronkowski, the 3-year-old cult,  named for the Patriots' tight end.  Rob Gronkowski, the player, recently  bought minority stake in the stakes horse, Gronkowski, who is set to run in  next month's Kentucky Derby.  But, Gronkowski, the horse, had a spike and  fever last weekend, and Gronkowski is not going to be running the Kentucky  Derby, and that's going to be May 5th at Churchill Downs.  Rob Gronkowski,  the person, expressing his lament.  Well, I want to know who gets back on  the field first: Rob Gronkowski the player or Rob Gronkowski the horse?  </p><p>KELLY:  I think Rob Gronkowski should run the Kentucky Derby, he's the true  beast.  I bet he could outrun that horse.  </p><p>MAX:  He said he wanted to get on that horse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, he did?</p><p>MAX:  And that was scary right of at that.</p><p>KELLY:  Would he do it shirtless?  </p><p>MAX:  I don't know what he'd do, but he's got a four time the body mass of  a jockey so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, how about this: racing champ, Matt Kenseth, to make a  return to NASCAR, Dagen.  Big news for NASCAR.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's kind of an exclamation point on what's been going on in the  sport.  Matt Kenseth is returning.  He's going to part-time drive for Roush  Racing this -- the rest of this year.  He's spent about a dozen years  racing for Roush, that's where he was when he won his only cup championship  that was back 2003 before the current playoff series was introduced.  Then,  he raced for Joe Gibbs racing.  Joe Gibbs racing replaced him with the  younger cheaper driver, which is a testament to what's happening in the  sport, is they want young blood.  Again, it's not just the ladies who get  cast aside when they get a little bit older, it's the men the too.  They  want young blood because they think millennials, that will attract to  advertising dollars and they're a lot cheaper.  So, they're trying to get  the salaries down on these drives and attract ads -- attract ad dollars.   Matt Kenseth, luckily, is getting back -- </p><p>KELLY:  Is part-time driving, is that a wave of the future?  I've never  heard really, kind of, part-time. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe, I highly doubt it, because it makes it very hard for  somebody to race, somebody who's only in the car part of the time.  And I  think that would impossible for you to -- if you're only racing part-time,  impossible to win a championship.   </p><p>BRENBERG:  Kevin, I don't think you can get into it.  </p><p>KELLY:  OK.  I've got a day job.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that was it.  That was the first sexist comment I've made.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I said it, so.</p><p>MAX:  Hey, how about -- Jenny Cavnar last time, very cool calls of baseball  game, play-by-play for the Colorado Rockies' first woman, who 25 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was cool.  </p><p>MAX:  Cool stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Catch Jared's sports report Fox News  Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, full steam ahead for phase  two of tax reform.  Kevin Brady in the studio, House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.

The S...00 dropped 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq backed off 0.2% apiece.&lt;nl/&gt; Volume was sharply mixed, rising 19% on the NYSE and falling 71% on the Nasdaq, relative to trade at the same time Monday.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> The stock market today[2] felt some early drag from the Commerce Department's weaker-than-expected September durable goods report.&lt;nl/&gt; Case-Shiller's 20-City Composite Home Price Index was a bit more positive, rising 0.1% for August. That was up from a 0.2% slip in July and in line with expectations.&lt;nl/&gt; A preliminary reading on October services-sector activity from researcher Markit put its Purchasing Managers' Index at 54.4, down from 55.6 in September and disappointing forecasts for 55.3.&lt;nl/&gt; Consumer sentiment also pulled back in October, with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading 97.6 vs. a revised 102.6 tally for September and far below estimates for 102.5.&lt;nl/&gt; In stocks, Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA[3]) broad-jumped 7% to join the ranks of big tech names posting solid earnings beats. The China-based diversified Internet play reported a 27% EPS gain and a 32% rise in revenue in its fiscal Q2 \u2014 both easily topping consensus forecasts. Mobile revenue rose 183%. Cloud computing and Internet infrastructure revenues rose 128%.&lt;nl/&gt; The company also announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission gave notice that it concluded its inquiry and no enforcement action would be recommended. The issue revolved around interactions with a regulator in China.&lt;nl/&gt; Alibaba's heavy-volume gain sent shares back above their 200-day moving average within an 11-month consolidation.&lt;nl/&gt; Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO[4]) popped 5%, pulled up by its 15% stake in Alibaba.&lt;nl/&gt; Coach (NYSE:COH[5]) bagged an 8% gain after sneaking past analyst Q3 consensus earnings expectations and meeting revenue forecasts.&lt;nl/&gt; Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW[6]) jumped more than 4% after topping both revenue and earnings expectations for the third quarter. The stock remains just below a 153.45 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.&lt;nl/&gt; Pfizer (NYSE:PFE[7]) grabbed a 3% gain to lead the Dow. The New York-based drugmaker reported a 5% earnings gain vs. expectations for a loss. Revenue fell a less-than-expected 2%. The strong volume gain sent shares past a 34.79 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Pfizer peer Merck (NYSE:MRK[8]) ranked second among the Dow's gains, up nearly 2% after a strong third quarter report.&lt;nl/&gt; Coal miner Consol Energy (NYSE:CNX[9]) tanked 12% after reporting an adjusted loss of 28 cents per share vs. expectations for a 5-cent loss.&lt;nl/&gt; Among leaders, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS[10]) rose 5% to step out to an early lead among IBD 50 stocks. The developer of automated circuit-design software reported earnings and revenue above forecasts, and gave full-year guidance above consensus views. The gain, in massive trade, triggered a break out past a 21.90 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.&lt;nl/&gt; Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM[11]) took the group's largest loss, down almost 5%. That sent the stock below its 10-week moving average in heavy trade, and 12% below a buy point \u2014 triggering two sell signals.&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.investors.com/investing.aspx\">http://news.investors.com/investing.aspx</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today\">http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-alibaba-group-hldg-ads-baba.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-alibaba-group-hldg-ads-baba.htm</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-yahoo-inc-yhoo.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-yahoo-inc-yhoo.htm</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-coach-inc-coh.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-coach-inc-coh.htm</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-edwards-lifesciences-cp-ew.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-edwards-lifesciences-cp-ew.htm</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-pfizer-inc-pfe.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-pfizer-inc-pfe.htm</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-merck-and-co-mrk.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-merck-and-co-mrk.htm</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-consol-energy-inc-cnx.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-consol-energy-inc-cnx.htm</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-cadence-design-systems-cdns.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-cadence-design-systems-cdns.htm</url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-calmaine-foods-inc-calm.htm\">http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-calmaine-foods-inc-calm.htm</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IVBD1164991445960369660538896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVBD-116499</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H7P-WD31-JCMN-Y22W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><timeReceived>3:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stock Market Today</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 27, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

Video game d...</p><p>\u2013 By Ben Egliston, Postdoctoral research fellow, Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology    There has been a clash of clans in mobile gaming, with angry birds Apple, Google and Epic Games in a saga over in-app payments.    Video game developer Epic\u2019s massively popular \u201c\u201d game Fortnite was  from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store last week.    Android players can still download the game directly via the Epic Games mobile app, but for Apple iOS users the decision means no new downloads. Currently installed versions of the game will still work, but iOS players will be unable to update the game and participate in the next season of Fortnite, beginning on August 27.    The boot from Apple and Google was in response to Epic\u2019s implementation of a direct in-app payment system, designed to circumvent Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s own payment systems and their  charged on . Epic\u2019s move is a clear violation of Apple\u2019s  for app monetisation.    The game develoepr also launched the hashtag  and aired an in-game parody of Apple\u2019s  which, at the time it was released, was Apple\u2019s own response to IBM\u2019s dominance of the computing industry.    The parody renders the ad in Fortnite\u2019s graphical style, but retains its original symbolism of oppression and control. Epic, valued at , is attempting to portray itself as Apple did back in 1984: as an underdog facing down a corporate behemoth.    The fight escalated this week, with Apple  Epic\u2019s enrolment in the Apple Developer Program should it not resolve its breach of Apple\u2019s policy.    Membership in the program is required for creating and distributing iOS software. Losing its enrolment wouldn\u2019t just affect Epic, or Fortnite, but potentially anyone using Epic\u2019s widely adopted  game development technology.    Considering there are more than a billion users of Android and iOS based mobile devices, these punitive responses (particularly from Apple) are being characterised by many as anti-competitive and monopolistic, including by Epic\u2019s chief executive Tim Sweeney.    In the past, other companies such as ,  and  have also protested Apple\u2019s 30% fee and strict control over the App Store. But none has so brazenly attacked Apple in the public sphere.    Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s response to this saga has highlighted the power of big tech platforms. As in the case of app stores, these platforms are enclosed and tightly regulated systems. You must play by the owner\u2019s rules, or you\u2019re expelled.    Read more:    In this case, Apple and Google know their app stores \u2013 where millions of users download their apps \u2013 are crucial to the financial success of developers on their platform.    As such they can exert their power over developers, who don\u2019t really have anywhere else to go.    Reminiscent of antitrust charges , critics of Apple and Google have described the tech behemoths as anti-competitive monopolies charging an unreasonable 30% transaction fee.    This falls to 15% in the case of subscription-based apps but only after an initial year of Apple charging the 30% fee. For perspective, PayPal only charges  of the value of each transaction.    Epic argues the mobile games market should be more like the PC market. For instance, Microsoft and Apple don\u2019t get to charge a percentage on every transaction we make through our computers just because they developed the operating system.    Given  to Apple\u2019s ban, it appears Epic anticipated it and was prepared for this outcome.    Is Epic\u2019s lawsuit ultimately aiming to renegotiate the percentage of app store cuts?    Maybe Epic believes it\u2019s in a strong enough position to push back against Apple and Google, given Fortnite\u2019s  and revenues, as well as the uptake of and value created by software using the Unreal Engine.    Or perhaps, given Apple\u2019s previous  of Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud, Epic believes Apple has overplayed its hand.    The mobile games industry is a massive source of revenue for app store operators. Perhaps Epic is banking on Apple and Google eventually deciding gaming is too lucrative to cast aside, and hoping they will succumb to renegotiating fees.    Epic claims, in the long run, it\u2019s doing this for everyone.    If it can force Apple to reduce the 30% fee, or launch an alternative game store on iOS with lower fees, developers will have to sell fewer game copies to make a profit. According to Epic, this means more games for everyone.    But it\u2019s also an opportunity for Epic to amplify its platform power by more aggressively expanding its games store into the mobile marketplace.    Regardless of what happens now, don\u2019t feel too sorry for Epic. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most profitable video game developers and a  in its own right (although at 12% it takes a  than Apple).    While Android players can still access Fortnite, only iOS players who already have the game installed will be able to keep playing. Alternatively, they may have to shell out  for a secondhand iPhone with Fortnite installed.    And whether or not iOS players will experience much of the upcoming season \u2013 that will be determined by Epic\u2019s next move.    Read more:    \u2013 ref.

The planned reforms arose from last year\u2019s  by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which focused squarely on the corporate behaviour of these two tech behemoths.    It is clear Google and Facebook will be the first platforms regulated under the draft mandatory code that will potentially  for content produced by Australian news media companies. The move is a response to what the ACCC  as \u201ca significant bargaining power imbalance [\u2026] between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook\u201d.    This idea that news companies are essentially stuck with Google and Facebook, for better or worse, is a common view. Yet while that might have been true a few years ago, media companies are realising there are other ways to cultivate readers, and there\u2019s no need to be beholden to tech platforms that generate clicks but .    The  completely changed newsroom practices over the past decade, as journalists have weighed editorial considerations against audience metrics.    This dependency developed at a time when major platforms, particularly Facebook, were engaging substantially with the distribution of news. But in recent years this trend has declined, as governments have begun to regulate platforms in response to concerns over \u201c\u201d.    Facebook performed perhaps the most public pivot,  in January 2018 to promote content from users\u2019 friends and family. As a result, traffic to news sites fell, leaving profit-starved media companies to pursue alternative strategies or simply .    Read more:    In our research, , we spoke to 15 Australian journalists and editors who had collectively worked across 11 media companies after the dust had settled from the 2019 crisis.    We asked them whether their companies still depend on Facebook for traffic, or whether they have moved to other platforms, or are now doing something else entirely to cultivate their readership.    Many respondents, particularly those who had worked at newer companies focused on , revealed they had followed the demands of the Facebook algorithm at times. They had pivoted to video and had focused on share counts. However, respondents working at older media companies also noted that lots of readers still visited their publication\u2019s home page, which challenges the idea that companies depend totally on Facebook.    Companies were also exploring different ways of generating revenue. These included placing ads inside content (known as ) and holding events.    The standout trend, however, was a renewed focus on , ensuring that a certain percentage of readers actually paid money for the news product at some point.    The Conversation (which does not charge for access to its content) was one of the newsrooms that saw a steep drop in traffic as a result of the January 2018 algorithm change. As such, it has pivoted its digital strategy to prioritise the channels over which it has the most control, particularly its .    That\u2019s not to say companies have stopped trying to engage with big platforms. Many are consciously trying to make their news easy to find via Google search (a process called . Some companies (including The Conversation) have also begun distributing news through Instagram (which is owned by Facebook).    Yet although the big platforms are doubtless here to stay, our research reveals a distinctly changed relationship between news and social media, compared with the past decade. Many companies, particularly newer ones like Buzzfeed and Vice, previously built huge audiences off the back of social media, and grew at a dizzying rate as a result. Now, companies are more interested in securing a stable revenue stream than in harvesting clicks.    This has become even more important amid the economic chaos caused by COVID-19. Advertising spending has dried up, leading to .    This suggests news media are still struggling to secure an alternative income stream to plug the hole in advertising revenue. The big question is whether big tech platforms will step in and help fill the gap by making financial contributions to news providers. Google\u2019s  against the draft mandatory code suggests they are deeply unwilling to do this.    Read more:    Our research shows the relationship between news media and big tech platforms is far from straightforward. This is supported by a , which found that while many young people access news through social media, older people still prefer television or news websites. Not every Australian gets their news via social media.    There may come a time when platforms become the central access point for news, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. This doesn\u2019t mean the ACCC should abandon platform regulation, but it does mean news companies are probably wise to find other ways of reaching their readers while they still can.    \u2013 ref.

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.    The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook\u2019s long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of , it has announced new applications like the , and will also  for future Oculus devices.    The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant\u2019s . VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we\u2019re likely to invite into our homes in the next decade.    Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for . But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media.    This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning and connecting with others at a distance.    But if the VR future is the one Facebook is \u201c\u201d on, it will function via the company\u2019s existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements.    A VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key  of emerging \u201cmixed reality\u201d technologies.    As AmericanVR researcher :    \u2026commercial VR systems typically track body movements 90 times per second to display the scene appropriately, and high-end systems record 18 types of movements across the head and hands. Consequently, spending 20 minutes in a VR simulation leaves just under 2 million unique recordings of body language.    The way you move your body can be , like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity.    Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.    In late 2019  they \u201cdon\u2019t collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today\u201d. Note the word today , which tech journalist  makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future.    Facebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR).    Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings.    Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you\u2019ve left your keys on the coffee table.    Now Facebook have announced their first steps towards making this a reality: . This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls \u201d, the next big tech platform.    Read more:    People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its  page, and they\u2019re already quick to emphasise that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection.    As we have , framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That\u2019s because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of ) and their .    Read more:    Groups like the  recognise these emerging issues, and are beginning work on  to shape VR and AR development.    Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as : it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change.    We see this playing out right now, in efforts to .    As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to :    Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech \u2026 The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation.    What might regulation of Facebook\u2019s VR look like? Germany offers one such response \u2013 their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook . We can only hope the technology doesn\u2019t become too entrenched to be changed, or challenged.    But regulation has not always stopped Facebook in the past, who paid out  to settle a lawsuit for breaching biometric privacy laws. In the multi-billion dollar world of big-tech, it\u2019s all a cost of doing business.    Another question we might ask ourselves is whether Facebook\u2019s virtual-reality future and others like it really need to exist. Maybe there are other ways to avoid forgetting your keys.    \u2013 ref.

Right now the Australian ...</p><p>\u2013 By Richard Holden, Professor of Economics, UNSW    You might have missed it \u2013 what with the biggest recession since the 1930s and a pandemic going on \u2013 but there may be big, and bad, changes happening to a media landscape near you.    Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to force Google and Facebook to pay local commercial media organisations for the sharing of their content on the digital platforms.    The  proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will require the tech and media companies to make terms through \u201cmandatory binding arbitration\u201d. It will also oblige them to divulge parts of their core intellectual property (such Google\u2019s search algorithm).    It has been lauded as a world-first in addressing the power imbalance between the platforms and traditional news organisations.    What this was all about was the imbalance in bargaining power, the market failure that comes from that, and underpayment for news having a detrimental effect on Australian society.    Who could argue with that? Even federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has described it as \u201ca question of fairness\u201d.    But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.    Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.    As I have  for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.    Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.    Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm  total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.    \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.    Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.    Read more:    The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.    That, as they say in the classics, is show business.    It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.    If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.    That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.    But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.    Read more:    In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.    All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.    For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:    If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.    There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.    An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.    Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.    But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.    Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.    Read more:    Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.    With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.    And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and Facebook that Australian consumers love.    \u2013 ref. Google and Facebook shouldn\u2019t subsidise journalism, but the government could \u2013    \u2013  \u2013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Rather than agree to negotiate with media companies to pay for using news content, Google has  and written an , while Facebook has threatened to .    At first glance, these responses might look like overreactions. For multinational companies with  of  in revenue each quarter, paying for Australian news would be small potatoes.    But their more pressing concern may be that whatever happens in Australia could set a precedent for other countries. Other nations are holding inquiries on how best to regulate big tech platforms, and they are watching developments in Australia very closely.    Both reviews call for new regulations to manage the relationship between platforms and news publishers. The UK specifically mentions a code of conduct. The Canadian inquiry discusses the possibility of a code but also suggests that online platforms could pay money into a fund to support Canadian content (including news).    Read more:    However, neither government has yet taken up these reforms. One reason for the delay in the UK is that the government there has a busy policy agenda around digital platforms, and is waiting for recommendations from multiple reviews before introducing major regulatory reform.    The second reason is that the UK and Canada are watching and waiting to see what happens in Australia.    Watching Australia makes sense. Canada and the UK have similar  to Australia. All three countries also share a common law heritage and often turn to each other for policy ideas.    As a result, it would be relatively easy for these countries to translate aspects of the ACCC\u2019s draft bargaining code to their own codes of conduct.

The Committee has brought together legislators from around the world who are working together to establish baseline regulatory principles for the internet and share policy solutions.    However, Canada is starting to move away from these international discussions and consider national solutions. Canada\u2019s heritage minister Steven Guilbeault recently , which suggests Australian developments might be  Canada\u2019s regulatory response.    Another problem for platforms is that countries without a shared legal heritage with Australia are also pursuing similar reforms. France is the most notable example: in April its competition authority ordered Google to .    The decision essentially forced Google to engage in a bargaining process like the one proposed in Australia. However, Google has been accused of not bargaining in good faith, and French publishers are returning to the regulators to .    French publishers have also tried to streamline the process by joining with their German colleagues with the goal of establishing a  for bargaining.    This combination of active reforms and dormant inquiries helps to explain why Google and Facebook have reacted so dramatically. Australia is engaging in a \u201c\u201d regulatory endeavour. However, it is important to remember that Australia is not the only country considering reforms, they are just the first to implement them. The big question is whether other countries are influenced by the Australian response.    The threat of a consistent international approach that would see Google and Facebook pay for news in multiple countries is what has brought the platforms onto the front foot, engaging in a dedicated public relations exercise.

Right now the Australian ...</p><p>\u2013 By Richard Holden, Professor of Economics, UNSW    You might have missed it \u2013 what with the biggest recession since the 1930s and a pandemic going on \u2013 but there may be big, and bad, changes happening to a media landscape near you.    Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to force Google and Facebook to pay local commercial media organisations for the sharing of their content on the digital platforms.    The  proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will require the tech and media companies to make terms through \u201cmandatory binding arbitration\u201d. It will also oblige them to divulge parts of their core intellectual property (such Google\u2019s search algorithm).    It has been lauded as a world-first in addressing the power imbalance between the platforms and traditional news organisations.    What this was all about was the imbalance in bargaining power, the market failure that comes from that, and underpayment for news having a detrimental effect on Australian society.    Who could argue with that? Even federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has described it as \u201ca question of fairness\u201d.    But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.    Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.    As I have  for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.    Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.    Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm  total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.    \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.    Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.    Read more:    The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.    That, as they say in the classics, is show business.    It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.    If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.    That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.    But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.    Read more:    In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.    All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.    For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:    If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.    There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.    An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.    Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.    But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.    Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.    Read more:    Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.    With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.    And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and Facebook that Australian consumers love.    \u2013 ref. Vital Signs. Google shouldn\u2019t subsidise journalism, but the government could \u2013    \u2013  \u2013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

At this time, it becomes important that we look-out for what the future of industry would be like. We haven't seen an era in which such fast-paced and rapid technological changes took place every day. In 2018, there were overnight transformations in domains like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, machine learning and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The year 2019, however, is bound to bring even better hopes and prospects for the industry. Moreover, since technology is directly connected to trade and growth in industry, it is bound to have implications on business development on a global scale. Here are six major IT trends to watch out for in 2019.</p><p>Chatbots will get mainstream</p><p>Owing to Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is taking multiple strides forward. NLP allows companies to gain immense insight into the users and customers so that the customer services can be improved and better products can be built. It is predicted that more than 40 per cent of the companies will adopt it by the end of 2019 for better services and products.</p><p>Connected clouds will grow</p><p>There seems to be a growing dependence on cloud support for services such as storage, data analytics, optimisation and much more. Organisations such as Amazon and Alibaba have been providing these services for a while now and they are only bound to grow branching into many different domains and verticals. Multi Clouds and Hybrid Clouds seem to be the buzzwords and the major things they provide include seamless, secure and streamlined services.</p><p>The essence of blockchain</p><p>Blockchain technology has been under the limelight for quite some time now and has been projected to be the next big tech break. Although it does seem like blockchain still requires a lot of clean-up before it can be implemented in mainstream markets, especially in financial sectors. This might be the year of realising the better potential of the block chain and in a couple of years, we will see the traction that it has promised.</p><p>Data safety at frontline</p><p>Data protection regulations such as GDPR aim to provide a huge layer of data protection to various users. As of now, data protection and safety is still not the priority of various organisations such as news reporting companies, which deal with huge amounts of information. In 2019, however, it would be common as informed customers will understand, require and seek the companies which truly protect their data and can be relied upon.</p><p>C-Suite professionals will take charge</p><p>C-Suite professionals are bound to start taking charge according to the demands of digital transformations.

The event, known as \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us,\"[1] has garnered nearly 2 million \"I'm going\" responses. How many of those people will actually show up to the event, scheduled for September 20 in Southern Nevada, remains to be seen. </p><p>In nearby town Rachel, Nevada, residents are getting ready as best as they can for the unexpected. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] \"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,\" the Facebook page reads. \"If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.\" In just three short sentences, the Facebook event page[3] titled, \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us,\" issues a tongue-in-cheek call to action. Get to this tourist attraction, coordinate entry, and storm Area 51! The page went from silly goof to viral meme in a shockingly short time, and it's easy to understand why: Aliens are a constant source of cultural interest, and the secretive US Air Force base is notoriously associated with housing secret aliens. And now, ahead of the coming September 20 event date, the nearby town of Rachel, Nevada is getting ready for an influx of new visitors. The Little A'Le'Inn, in Rachel, Nevada, is a tourist-favorite stop near the USAF base known as Area 51. The 25-year-old hotel offers housing, and sells souvenirs \u2014 it is \"booked solid\" for the upcoming event, according to the website. David Becker/Getty Images\"MORE CAMPING MAY BECOME AVAILABLE,\" it says on the website[4].The Little A'Le'Inn sits along Nevada's Route 375, known as the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\" \u2014 that's the official name of the route as of 1996, so-named by state legislators. David Becker/Getty Images Not to be outdone by the US government, the Little A'Le'Inn has its own flying saucer for tourists to snap photos with.

According to AAA, today could be the busiest day for travel in more than a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Rene Marsh is live at Reagan National Airport in Virginia with more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How's it looking, Rene?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RENE MARSH, CNN TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, I can tell you, most people will probably travel by car. Some 48 million more than that. But we are expecting record air travel. More than 30 million people were here at Reagan National Airport, just right outside of Washington, D.C. And you said the rush is on. You're absolutely right. You see all these folks. They're lined up here to go through the TSA checkpoint.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When we talk about record breaking here, more than 6 percent compared to 2017, as far as travelers. We know that U.S. airports are probably going to be the busiest when it comes to Thanksgiving travel season. Airlines are going to cope with all of this by adding more than 150,000 seats. They're going to do that by adding more flights, as well as using large aircraft.</p><p>TSA, which is back there, they are also adding staff. We know that the K-9s are going to be used here at airports across the country as well. That's a way to expedite screening.</p><p>As far as delays and cancelations, good news for people so far, things look good across the board here in the United States. No issues as far as cancelations. There is going to be your only issue, just everyone lined up, everyone trying to get to their destination. This one of the busier travel days of the Thanksgiving travel season.</p><p>Back to you, John.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: I have to say, Rene, that's actually a pretty serious line for Reagan National Airport, even at this hour.</p><p>MARSH: Yes, but it's moving. BERMAN: Rene Marsh live at the airport. And for all the reporters out there doing travel live shots today, as a consolation, I'll tell you, it's two days until Black Friday. So you'll be out on Friday covering shopping.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Back in the cold. So enjoy being inside there.</p><p>BERMAN: Enjoy being inside.</p><p>All right, so if you live in the Northeast, don't forget your parka tomorrow. This Thanksgiving expected to be brutally cold, like the coldest in a century cold.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I get it. I get it.</p><p>BERMAN: CNN's meteorologist Chad Myers with your forecast.</p><p>Chad, I understand it's going to be cold.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, boy.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: It is. Windchill factor probably for the parade in New York City somewhere around six. So -- and then you think about the buildings and the windchill with the wind tunnels and it could be like zero.</p><p>It's already snowing upstate New York, so some travel problems there along the throughway.</p><p>But this weather is brought to you by the Shark Ion Robot Cleaning System. One dock, two Sharks.</p><p>And you may need some snow shovels around parts of upstate New York today. Temperatures still good for today. This is the best travel day so far we've seen for early Thanksgiving. May not saying the same thing on Sunday as you go home. But tomorrow and Friday will be the cold coldest days of the year so far. That arctic air is moving in. So is the wind. It warms up by Saturday and Sunday, but it's the wind that's going to be the problem. At least 20 record lows for tomorrow and windchills are going to be in the single digits for most -- and even well below that if you're standing in line in Syracuse.</p><p>So for the parade, here we go. I know you're going to be out there anyway likely. Seventeen will be the morning low. That is a new record low. You never forecast a record low, but there it is. And there's Snoopy. So don't go too far. The winds are going to be 20 miles per hour. John and Alisyn, the cutoff if they fly or not is 23. So we are still game time decision with that. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAMEROTA: Sounds dicey. Keep us posted. Yes, fingers crossed. Chad, thank you very much.</p><p>MYERS: You're welcome.</p><p>CAMEROTA: As text stocks go, so go the markets.</p><p>BERMAN: As they say.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yesterday we saw a huge drop erasing the gains for the year. Is this a blip or a bigger trend?</p><p>[06:38:49] BERMAN: So the Dow lost more than 500 points yesterday, wiping out all the gains for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is also now down for the year. Investigators are worried. The days of record profits might be near an end and tech stocks are taking the biggest hit.</p><p>Look at your screen. These five big tech names have lost more than $800 billion, a combined market value since August. $800 billion seems like a lot of money.</p><p>Joining us now, Stephen Moore, former Trump economic advisers and distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and Rana Foroohar, global business columnist and associate editor for \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>And I graduated, I have a PhD from the Christine Romans school of business reporting.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: That's pretty good.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST: That's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: It's not bad, right? And she constantly tells me that the stock market is not the economy. I get that.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: However, these companies are part of the economy. So what's going on, Rana? What is the concern? Why has the market taken such a hit over the last six weeks?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I think that you have to look at which companies are leading this. And as you point out, it's being led by the big tech companies. Now, they were the ones that were leading the market over the last few years. They led it up. They're now leading it down.</p><p>The rise of these companies was predicated on the fact that they're very loosely regulated, right? I mean they've been allowed to kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies haven't. They've also been very global. I mean these are the most global companies.</p><p>[06:40:10] We are now in a situation where trade is becoming an issue. There's a U.S./China trade war. It's very much a tech war. These companies are really in the front lines of that. So all the things that led them going up are now in question.</p><p>BERMAN: It's fears of the future to an extent.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which is also beginning to happen a little bit in retail, right? Thanksgiving is tomorrow which means the Christmas rush is on. And Target lowered its sales forecast, which caused a lot of people, I think, to raise their eyebrows and say, hey, what's going on here?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, well, look, I only have a master's degree in the Christine Roman's School of Economics. But, look, you made a key point, there is a difference between the real economy and the financial economy. And the -- one of the most important points I think is if you look at the real economy, things still look really good to me. I mean construction is really good. Manufacturing is good. Industrial production is good. Consumer confidence is good.</p><p>Now you mentioned a good point, the market got spooked yesterday and the day before by some, you know, preliminary bad news on consumer spending. This -- this next two weeks for retailers is everything, right? And Black Friday is huge. And so some of the big, big retail companies were reporting some disappointing numbers. But we'll know much better --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: You know, a week from now about how -- but, look, I went to the mall on Friday.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I couldn't find a parking space, you know. So people are going out there. Maybe they're just not buying.</p><p>BERMAN: There we go. Every economics' PhD is like go -- putting their head in their face right now and saying, no, that's not research. But just to be clear, the Target news, you're absolutely right about -- about the economy until this point over the last several years, but that's why that news from Target doesn't fly in the face of it, but it -- but it --</p><p>MOORE: It's true. It's confounding.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: But, you know, the one piece -- I'm not a stock picker, I'm not a stock analyst, but I always, you know, tell people, if you're in the stock market for the long term, you know, five years, 10 years, don't even -- my wife looks at these returns every day, but don't do that.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, my gosh. A disaster. You cannot do that.</p><p>MOORE: And when you get a -- when you get a dip in the market, that's not a bad time -- I'm actually kind of bullish on (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: That's the other thing that's kind of confounding about this dip in the stock market. Earnings for the companies, which is, as Larry Kudlow likes to say, earnings are the mother's milk in the stock market, those have been pretty good.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, some of it has to do with interest rates too, right?</p><p>MOORE: That's true.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, I mean we're --</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>FOROOHAR: We're about to go through a turn. And we knew that's been coming. Christine Romans School of -- PhD. And if that happens, stocks are probably going to correct, right, because the stock markets like low interest rates. Companies can do more business. They can borrow and buy back their own shares and that raises prices. But if rates go up, that could change things.</p><p>MOORE: But that's, by the way, a big bone -- we've had this discussion on this show many times. You know, I happen to agree with Trump, I think that the Fed has been too tight on interest rates. And if you kind of trace -- because this bear market, it kind of started actually about six weeks ago. And it really did kind of start with when the Fed started raising rates. And, you know, I don't see a lot of inflation out there. I think that the Fed is kind of afraid of growth. And I think that's tied to this bearish market.</p><p>BERMAN: There are two other things, though that are connected to it. And, Rana, you alluded to the first one, which is the idea of a trade war.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which, again, investors are looking long term and saying, you know what, this may start to bite soon.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: This might start to cut into profits. It might start to hurt the real economy.</p><p>FOROOHAR: For sure. And it's going to depend on which sector you're talking about. I mean I think tech stocks are really going to be quite vulnerable. I think some of the most global companies will be very vulnerable. Things like health care, retail, maybe not so much. Things that are U.S.-based not so much.</p><p>But, yes, there's a lot in the market. I mean most Fortune 500 companies today make most of their profits overseas. So if you start getting into a situation where it's not business as usual, then these companies are going to take a hit.</p><p>BERMAN: And right now the United States is doing better than the rest of the economies around the world largely --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>BERMAN: So we're a safe haven, we're an island of stability. But sometimes that can just flip on a moment's notice and we can get dragged down. FOROOHAR: Well, it can. And, you know, I mean -- we were talking earlier about how the real economy and the stock market are separate, but I'm really interested to see how much affect a fall in the market, which, you know, a lot of people have a lot of money in the market right now, how is that going to affect the real economy? I mean, you know, some people think that if you see a big correction, it could really affect consumer spending.</p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>Now, on this issue of the trade, I mean this is a great point.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I mean the -- the investors are watching like every day what's happening with these negotiations between Trump and Beijing on China. I'm not one who thinks that there's going to be an immediate resolution to this.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I agree with that.</p><p>MOORE: It's a long-term. You know, but I will say this, if Trump can pull this off, and he can get a deal with China, then it's just going to be, shew (ph), the stock market's going to go through the roof.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Now when that's going to happen, none of us know.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Whether it's going to happen in six months, or three months or a year. But I do think in the end, there will be a deal. And when that happens, I think people are going to feel -- investors are going to feel very relieved.</p><p>BERMAN: Me time. Me time. We could even talk about the budget deficit, which is whole other issue, which we can talk about soon because it's just going to go up.</p><p>[06:45:00] MOORE: We don't want to depress people the day before Thanksgiving.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, another (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: But that's the point, it's just going to go up, and I think that's hanging over peoples' heads, too, as they think about long term.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Let them digest Thanksgiving dinner and then we'll come back to it.</p><p>BERMAN: Rana Foroohar, Stephen Moore, great to have you with us.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy Thanksgiving to both of you.</p><p>MOORE: You too. Thanks.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I hope Christine Romans was watching. I'm going to alert her.</p><p>OK, meanwhile, to this story. After a year of apologizing for FaceBook's missteps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is sounding more defiant. A \"New York Times\" report claims that FaceBook was not transparent about Russian interference in the 2016 election. It also revealed the company hired a PR firm to dig up dirt on its competition. Now, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall, Zuckerberg dismissed questions about his own performance and about the leadership of COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: There are a lot of questions now about Sheryl Sandberg's role in the latest controversy. Can you definitively say Sheryl will stay in her same role?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: Yes, look, Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest efforts that -- the biggest issues that we have. So when you look at a lot of the progress that we've made over the last 12 to 18 months on issued around elections or content or security, Sheryl was leading a lot of that work. And she's been an important partner for me for ten years. And, you know, I'm really proud of the work that we've done together. And I hope that we work together for decades more to come.</p><p>SEGALL: You are CEO and chairman of FaceBook. That's an extraordinary amount of power given that you rule a kingdom of 2 billion people digitally. Shouldn't your power be checked?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. I think that ultimately the issues that we're working on here, you know, things like preventing interference in elections from other countries, finding the balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe, these are not issues that any one company can address.</p><p>SEGALL: So you are not stepping down as chairman?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: That's not the plan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Zuckerberg also says FaceBook has a different world view than some of the people who cover the company. What does that mean? A lot more of our CNN exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg ahead on NEW DAY.</p><p>BERMAN: So what was with that answer, that's not the plan?</p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't know.</p><p>BERMAN: When a no -- a no would work.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What was with the Cheshire grin?</p><p>BERMAN: I don't know.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Let's find out.</p><p>BERMAN: Much more next hour.</p><p>So you're going to want to check your refrigerator after this next segment. You may have something in there the CDC now says is not safe to eat. We have the details, next.</p><p>[06:51:06] CAMEROTA: A surprise decision overnight. The international police agency, Interpol, elected acting president Kim Jong-yang to permanently take the role. Members of the agency rejected a Russian official who was expected to get this job. U.S. and European critics had opposed the Russian official's candidacy over concerns that he would use the position to target the Kremlin's political foes.</p><p>BERMAN: The death toll from the so-called Camp Fire in California has now risen again to 81 people, 870 people are still unaccounted for. And that number, that is very high. Sheriff deputies say they are still trying to get a backlog of voicemails. The Camp Fire is now 75 percent contained. Heavy rain is predicted in northern California into Saturday. That could help with air quality but authorities are worried about mudslides.</p><p>CAMEROTA: New financial disclosures filed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, reveal close to $1 million in payments from a conservative group that he founded in 2014. The group was known, ironically, as FACT, and it received almost all of its funding from a dark money organization which got at least some of its funding from major Republican donor Charles Koch. Most of Whitaker's income in the past few years came from that conservative group, although CNN also paid him $15,000 as a legal commentator in 2017. The disclosure's magnify the concerns over whether the Senate would ever confirm Whitaker if the president nominated him as permanent attorney general.</p><p>BERMAN: Of course there is no confirmation hearing on this because he's only been nominated or selected as an acting attorney general, which is the issue. Which is the issue. All this kind of stuff would come up in a confirmation hearing which will not exist.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a statement, issuing a major food warning just before Thanksgiving. It says do not eat romaine lettuce at all because it could be contaminated with E. Coli. CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins u now. This is a big, widespread warning, Elizabeth.</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, John.</p><p>Usually you see these things for a particular brand or a particular lot of food, but this is just all romaine lettuce. And let's take a look at the map to see how widespread this is. There have been cases in 11 states going all the way from Massachusetts to California, 32 people sick and the culprit is not just E. Coli, it's E. Coli 015787, a particularly vicious strain of E. Coli that can cause your kidneys to really basically shut down. Of the 32 people who have been sick, 13 have been hospitalized, one of them has had kidney damage.</p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: And, Elizabeth, how close are investigators to pinpointing the source of all this contamination?</p><p>COHEN: You know what, John, they are not close at all. All they can say is just it's romaine lettuce from somewhere. And you may remember that exactly a year ago there was also an outbreak of E. Coli in romaine lettuce, and a year later they still don't know where that came from. The best they can say is that it's from multiple outlets in Arizona, California and Mexico. So even a year later, with the outbreak last year, they still don't know where it came from.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Elizabeth Cohen for us. Thank you very much.</p><p>In the meantime, you know, be careful. Be careful what's in your refrigerator.</p><p>Thanks, Elizabeth.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John, another case of President Trump attempting to abuse his power. He wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. What stopped him?</p><p>[06:58:39] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's just awfully good Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Because you'd be in jail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was told he could face impeachment if he went ahead with this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the sort of stuff of a banana republic. This is what an autocrat does.</p><p>TRUMP: Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president needs to say it's unacceptable and wrong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are seeing our moral standing in the world eroded.</p><p>What is becoming of America?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: It is not clear to me at all that the report is right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: FaceBook downplayed Russia's involvement. They took advantage of user's data.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: A lot of the criticism has been fair, but we have a different world view than some of the folks who are covering this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to your NEW DAY.</p><p>CNN has learned that President Trump repeatedly wanted to order the Justice Department to go after his political rivals. A source tells CNN the president wanted to have Hillary Clinton prosecuted and repeatedly pressed then White House Counsel Don McGahn, to lean on the Justice Department to do so.

According to AAA, today could be the busiest day for travel in more than a decade. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Rene Marsh is live at Reagan National Airport in Virginia with more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How's it looking, Rene? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RENE MARSH, CNN TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, I can tell you, most people will probably travel by car. Some 48 million more than that. But we are expecting record air travel. More than 30 million people were here at Reagan National Airport, just right outside of Washington, D.C. And you said the rush is on. You're absolutely right. You see all these folks. They're lined up here to go through the TSA checkpoint. </p><p>When we talk about record breaking here, more than 6 percent compared to 2017, as far as travelers. We know that U.S. airports are probably going to be the busiest when it comes to Thanksgiving travel season. Airlines are going to cope with all of this by adding more than 150,000 seats. They're going to do that by adding more flights, as well as using large aircraft.</p><p>TSA, which is back there, they are also adding staff. We know that the K-9s are going to be used here at airports across the country as well. That's a way to expedite screening. </p><p>As far as delays and cancelations, good news for people so far, things look good across the board here in the United States. No issues as far as cancelations. There is going to be your only issue, just everyone lined up, everyone trying to get to their destination. This one of the busier travel days of the Thanksgiving travel season.</p><p>Back to you, John. </p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: I have to say, Rene, that's actually a pretty serious line for Reagan National Airport, even at this hour. </p><p>MARSH: Yes, but it's moving.  BERMAN: Rene Marsh live at the airport. And for all the reporters out there doing travel live shots today, as a consolation, I'll tell you, it's two days until Black Friday. So you'll be out on Friday covering shopping.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Back in the cold. So enjoy being inside there.</p><p>BERMAN: Enjoy being inside.</p><p>All right, so if you live in the Northeast, don't forget your parka tomorrow. This Thanksgiving expected to be brutally cold, like the coldest in a century cold. </p><p>CAMEROTA: I get it. I get it. </p><p>BERMAN: CNN's meteorologist Chad Myers with your forecast.</p><p>Chad, I understand it's going to be cold.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, boy.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: It is. Windchill factor probably for the parade in New York City somewhere around six. So -- and then you think about the buildings and the windchill with the wind tunnels and it could be like zero. </p><p>It's already snowing upstate New York, so some travel problems there along the throughway. </p><p>But this weather is brought to you by the Shark Ion Robot Cleaning System. One dock, two Sharks. </p><p>And you may need some snow shovels around parts of upstate New York today. Temperatures still good for today. This is the best travel day so far we've seen for early Thanksgiving. May not saying the same thing on Sunday as you go home. But tomorrow and Friday will be the cold coldest days of the year so far. That arctic air is moving in. So is the wind. It warms up by Saturday and Sunday, but it's the wind that's going to be the problem. At least 20 record lows for tomorrow and windchills are going to be in the single digits for most -- and even well below that if you're standing in line in Syracuse. </p><p>So for the parade, here we go. I know you're going to be out there anyway likely. Seventeen will be the morning low. That is a new record low. You never forecast a record low, but there it is. And there's Snoopy. So don't go too far. The winds are going to be 20 miles per hour. John and Alisyn, the cutoff if they fly or not is 23. So we are still game time decision with that. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAMEROTA: Sounds dicey. Keep us posted. Yes, fingers crossed. Chad, thank you very much. </p><p>MYERS: You're welcome.</p><p>CAMEROTA: As text stocks go, so go the markets. </p><p>BERMAN: As they say.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yesterday we saw a huge drop erasing the gains for the year. Is this a blip or a bigger trend?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[06:38:49] BERMAN: So the Dow lost more than 500 points yesterday, wiping out all the gains for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is also now down for the year. Investigators are worried. The days of record profits might be near an end and tech stocks are taking the biggest hit. </p><p>Look at your screen. These five big tech names have lost more than $800 billion, a combined market value since August. $800 billion seems like a lot of money. </p><p>Joining us now, Stephen Moore, former Trump economic advisers and distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and Rana Foroohar, global business columnist and associate editor for \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>And I graduated, I have a PhD from the Christine Romans school of business reporting.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: That's pretty good.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST: That's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: It's not bad, right? And she constantly tells me that the stock market is not the economy. I get that. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: However, these companies are part of the economy. So what's going on, Rana? What is the concern? Why has the market taken such a hit over the last six weeks? </p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I think that you have to look at which companies are leading this. And as you point out, it's being led by the big tech companies. Now, they were the ones that were leading the market over the last few years. They led it up. They're now leading it down. </p><p>The rise of these companies was predicated on the fact that they're very loosely regulated, right? I mean they've been allowed to kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies haven't. They've also been very global. I mean these are the most global companies. </p><p>[06:40:10] We are now in a situation where trade is becoming an issue. There's a U.S./China trade war. It's very much a tech war. These companies are really in the front lines of that. So all the things that led them going up are now in question. </p><p>BERMAN: It's fears of the future to an extent.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which is also beginning to happen a little bit in retail, right? Thanksgiving is tomorrow which means the Christmas rush is on. And Target lowered its sales forecast, which caused a lot of people, I think, to raise their eyebrows and say, hey, what's going on here? </p><p>MOORE: Yes, well, look, I only have a master's degree in the Christine Roman's School of Economics. But, look, you made a key point, there is a difference between the real economy and the financial economy. And the -- one of the most important points I think is if you look at the real economy, things still look really good to me. I mean construction is really good. Manufacturing is good. Industrial production is good. Consumer confidence is good. </p><p>Now you mentioned a good point, the market got spooked yesterday and the day before by some, you know, preliminary bad news on consumer spending. This -- this next two weeks for retailers is everything, right? And Black Friday is huge. And so some of the big, big retail companies were reporting some disappointing numbers. But we'll know much better --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: You know, a week from now about how -- but, look, I went to the mall on Friday. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I couldn't find a parking space, you know. So people are going out there. Maybe they're just not buying. </p><p>BERMAN: There we go. Every economics' PhD is like go -- putting their head in their face right now and saying, no, that's not research. But just to be clear, the Target news, you're absolutely right about -- about the economy until this point over the last several years, but that's why that news from Target doesn't fly in the face of it, but it -- but it --</p><p>MOORE: It's true. It's confounding.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: But, you know, the one piece -- I'm not a stock picker, I'm not a stock analyst, but I always, you know, tell people, if you're in the stock market for the long term, you know, five years, 10 years, don't even -- my wife looks at these returns every day, but don't do that.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, my gosh. A disaster. You cannot do that.</p><p>MOORE: And when you get a -- when you get a dip in the market, that's not a bad time -- I'm actually kind of bullish on (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: That's the other thing that's kind of confounding about this dip in the stock market. Earnings for the companies, which is, as Larry Kudlow likes to say, earnings are the mother's milk in the stock market, those have been pretty good. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, some of it has to do with interest rates too, right?</p><p>MOORE: That's true.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, I mean we're -- </p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>FOROOHAR: We're about to go through a turn. And we knew that's been coming. Christine Romans School of -- PhD. And if that happens, stocks are probably going to correct, right, because the stock markets like low interest rates. Companies can do more business. They can borrow and buy back their own shares and that raises prices. But if rates go up, that could change things. </p><p>MOORE: But that's, by the way, a big bone -- we've had this discussion on this show many times. You know, I happen to agree with Trump, I think that the Fed has been too tight on interest rates. And if you kind of trace -- because this bear market, it kind of started actually about six weeks ago. And it really did kind of start with when the Fed started raising rates. And, you know, I don't see a lot of inflation out there. I think that the Fed is kind of afraid of growth. And I think that's tied to this bearish market. </p><p>BERMAN: There are two other things, though that are connected to it. And, Rana, you alluded to the first one, which is the idea of a trade war.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which, again, investors are looking long term and saying, you know what, this may start to bite soon.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: This might start to cut into profits. It might start to hurt the real economy.</p><p>FOROOHAR: For sure. And it's going to depend on which sector you're talking about. I mean I think tech stocks are really going to be quite vulnerable. I think some of the most global companies will be very vulnerable. Things like health care, retail, maybe not so much. Things that are U.S.-based not so much. </p><p>But, yes, there's a lot in the market. I mean most Fortune 500 companies today make most of their profits overseas. So if you start getting into a situation where it's not business as usual, then these companies are going to take a hit. </p><p>BERMAN: And right now the United States is doing better than the rest of the economies around the world largely --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>BERMAN: So we're a safe haven, we're an island of stability. But sometimes that can just flip on a moment's notice and we can get dragged down.  FOROOHAR: Well, it can. And, you know, I mean -- we were talking earlier about how the real economy and the stock market are separate, but I'm really interested to see how much affect a fall in the market, which, you know, a lot of people have a lot of money in the market right now, how is that going to affect the real economy? I mean, you know, some people think that if you see a big correction, it could really affect consumer spending. </p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>Now, on this issue of the trade, I mean this is a great point. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I mean the -- the investors are watching like every day what's happening with these negotiations between Trump and Beijing on China. I'm not one who thinks that there's going to be an immediate resolution to this.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I agree with that.</p><p>MOORE: It's a long-term. You know, but I will say this, if Trump can pull this off, and he can get a deal with China, then it's just going to be, shew (ph), the stock market's going to go through the roof. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Now when that's going to happen, none of us know. </p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Whether it's going to happen in six months, or three months or a year. But I do think in the end, there will be a deal. And when that happens, I think people are going to feel -- investors are going to feel very relieved. </p><p>BERMAN: Me time. Me time. We could even talk about the budget deficit, which is whole other issue, which we can talk about soon because it's just going to go up.</p><p>[06:45:00] MOORE: We don't want to depress people the day before Thanksgiving.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, another (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: But that's the point, it's just going to go up, and I think that's hanging over peoples' heads, too, as they think about long term. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Let them digest Thanksgiving dinner and then we'll come back to it.</p><p>BERMAN: Rana Foroohar, Stephen Moore, great to have you with us. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. </p><p>MOORE: You too. Thanks.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I hope Christine Romans was watching. I'm going to alert her.</p><p>OK, meanwhile, to this story. After a year of apologizing for FaceBook's missteps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is sounding more defiant. A \"New York Times\" report claims that FaceBook was not transparent about Russian interference in the 2016 election. It also revealed the company hired a PR firm to dig up dirt on its competition. Now, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall, Zuckerberg dismissed questions about his own performance and about the leadership of COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: There are a lot of questions now about Sheryl Sandberg's role in the latest controversy. Can you definitively say Sheryl will stay in her same role? </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: Yes, look, Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest efforts that -- the biggest issues that we have. So when you look at a lot of the progress that we've made over the last 12 to 18 months on issued around elections or content or security, Sheryl was leading a lot of that work. And she's been an important partner for me for ten years. And, you know, I'm really proud of the work that we've done together. And I hope that we work together for decades more to come. </p><p>SEGALL: You are CEO and chairman of FaceBook. That's an extraordinary amount of power given that you rule a kingdom of 2 billion people digitally. Shouldn't your power be checked? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. I think that ultimately the issues that we're working on here, you know, things like preventing interference in elections from other countries, finding the balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe, these are not issues that any one company can address. </p><p>SEGALL: So you are not stepping down as chairman? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: That's not the plan. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Zuckerberg also says FaceBook has a different world view than some of the people who cover the company. What does that mean? A lot more of our CNN exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg ahead on NEW DAY.</p><p>BERMAN: So what was with that answer, that's not the plan? </p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't know. </p><p>BERMAN: When a no -- a no would work. </p><p>CAMEROTA: What was with the Cheshire grin?</p><p>BERMAN: I don't know.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Let's find out.</p><p>BERMAN: Much more next hour. </p><p>So you're going to want to check your refrigerator after this next segment. You may have something in there the CDC now says is not safe to eat. We have the details, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[06:51:06] CAMEROTA: A surprise decision overnight. The international police agency, Interpol, elected acting president Kim Jong-yang to permanently take the role. Members of the agency rejected a Russian official who was expected to get this job. U.S. and European critics had opposed the Russian official's candidacy over concerns that he would use the position to target the Kremlin's political foes. </p><p>BERMAN: The death toll from the so-called Camp Fire in California has now risen again to 81 people, 870 people are still unaccounted for. And that number, that is very high. Sheriff deputies say they are still trying to get a backlog of voicemails. The Camp Fire is now 75 percent contained. Heavy rain is predicted in northern California into Saturday. That could help with air quality but authorities are worried about mudslides. </p><p>CAMEROTA: New financial disclosures filed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, reveal close to $1 million in payments from a conservative group that he founded in 2014. The group was known, ironically, as FACT, and it received almost all of its funding from a dark money organization which got at least some of its funding from major Republican donor Charles Koch. Most of Whitaker's income in the past few years came from that conservative group, although CNN also paid him $15,000 as a legal commentator in 2017. The disclosure's magnify the concerns over whether the Senate would ever confirm Whitaker if the president nominated him as permanent attorney general. </p><p>BERMAN: Of course there is no confirmation hearing on this because he's only been nominated or selected as an acting attorney general, which is the issue. Which is the issue. All this kind of stuff would come up in a confirmation hearing which will not exist. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a statement, issuing a major food warning just before Thanksgiving. It says do not eat romaine lettuce at all because it could be contaminated with E. Coli. CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins u now. This is a big, widespread warning, Elizabeth. </p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, John.</p><p>Usually you see these things for a particular brand or a particular lot of food, but this is just all romaine lettuce. And let's take a look at the map to see how widespread this is. There have been cases in 11 states going all the way from Massachusetts to California, 32 people sick and the culprit is not just E. Coli, it's E. Coli 015787, a particularly vicious strain of E. Coli that can cause your kidneys to really basically shut down. Of the 32 people who have been sick, 13 have been hospitalized, one of them has had kidney damage. </p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: And, Elizabeth, how close are investigators to pinpointing the source of all this contamination? </p><p>COHEN: You know what, John, they are not close at all. All they can say is just it's romaine lettuce from somewhere. And you may remember that exactly a year ago there was also an outbreak of E. Coli in romaine lettuce, and a year later they still don't know where that came from. The best they can say is that it's from multiple outlets in Arizona, California and Mexico. So even a year later, with the outbreak last year, they still don't know where it came from. </p><p>BERMAN: All right, Elizabeth Cohen for us. Thank you very much.</p><p>In the meantime, you know, be careful. Be careful what's in your refrigerator. </p><p>Thanks, Elizabeth.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John, another case of President Trump attempting to abuse his power.

A source tells CNN the president wanted to have Hillary Clinton prosecuted and repeatedly pressed then White House Counsel Don McGahn, to lean on the Justice Department to do so.

According to AAA, today could be the busiest day for travel in more than a decade. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Rene Marsh is live at Reagan National Airport in Virginia with more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How's it looking, Rene? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RENE MARSH, CNN TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, I can tell you, most people will probably travel by car. Some 48 million more than that. But we are expecting record air travel. More than 30 million people were here at Reagan National Airport, just right outside of Washington, D.C. And you said the rush is on. You're absolutely right. You see all these folks. They're lined up here to go through the TSA checkpoint. </p><p>When we talk about record breaking here, more than 6 percent compared to 2017, as far as travelers. We know that U.S. airports are probably going to be the busiest when it comes to Thanksgiving travel season. Airlines are going to cope with all of this by adding more than 150,000 seats. They're going to do that by adding more flights, as well as using large aircraft.</p><p>TSA, which is back there, they are also adding staff. We know that the K-9s are going to be used here at airports across the country as well. That's a way to expedite screening. </p><p>As far as delays and cancelations, good news for people so far, things look good across the board here in the United States. No issues as far as cancelations. There is going to be your only issue, just everyone lined up, everyone trying to get to their destination. This one of the busier travel days of the Thanksgiving travel season.</p><p>Back to you, John. </p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: I have to say, Rene, that's actually a pretty serious line for Reagan National Airport, even at this hour. </p><p>MARSH: Yes, but it's moving.  BERMAN: Rene Marsh live at the airport. And for all the reporters out there doing travel live shots today, as a consolation, I'll tell you, it's two days until Black Friday. So you'll be out on Friday covering shopping.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Back in the cold. So enjoy being inside there.</p><p>BERMAN: Enjoy being inside.</p><p>All right, so if you live in the Northeast, don't forget your parka tomorrow. This Thanksgiving expected to be brutally cold, like the coldest in a century cold. </p><p>CAMEROTA: I get it. I get it. </p><p>BERMAN: CNN's meteorologist Chad Myers with your forecast.</p><p>Chad, I understand it's going to be cold.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, boy.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: It is. Windchill factor probably for the parade in New York City somewhere around six. So -- and then you think about the buildings and the windchill with the wind tunnels and it could be like zero. </p><p>It's already snowing upstate New York, so some travel problems there along the throughway. </p><p>But this weather is brought to you by the Shark Ion Robot Cleaning System. One dock, two Sharks. </p><p>And you may need some snow shovels around parts of upstate New York today. Temperatures still good for today. This is the best travel day so far we've seen for early Thanksgiving. May not saying the same thing on Sunday as you go home. But tomorrow and Friday will be the cold coldest days of the year so far. That arctic air is moving in. So is the wind. It warms up by Saturday and Sunday, but it's the wind that's going to be the problem. At least 20 record lows for tomorrow and windchills are going to be in the single digits for most -- and even well below that if you're standing in line in Syracuse. </p><p>So for the parade, here we go. I know you're going to be out there anyway likely. Seventeen will be the morning low. That is a new record low. You never forecast a record low, but there it is. And there's Snoopy. So don't go too far. The winds are going to be 20 miles per hour. John and Alisyn, the cutoff if they fly or not is 23. So we are still game time decision with that. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAMEROTA: Sounds dicey. Keep us posted. Yes, fingers crossed. Chad, thank you very much. </p><p>MYERS: You're welcome.</p><p>CAMEROTA: As text stocks go, so go the markets. </p><p>BERMAN: As they say.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yesterday we saw a huge drop erasing the gains for the year. Is this a blip or a bigger trend?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[06:38:49] BERMAN: So the Dow lost more than 500 points yesterday, wiping out all the gains for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is also now down for the year. Investigators are worried. The days of record profits might be near an end and tech stocks are taking the biggest hit. </p><p>Look at your screen. These five big tech names have lost more than $800 billion, a combined market value since August. $800 billion seems like a lot of money. </p><p>Joining us now, Stephen Moore, former Trump economic advisers and distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and Rana Foroohar, global business columnist and associate editor for \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>And I graduated, I have a PhD from the Christine Romans school of business reporting.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: That's pretty good.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST: That's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: It's not bad, right? And she constantly tells me that the stock market is not the economy. I get that. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: However, these companies are part of the economy. So what's going on, Rana? What is the concern? Why has the market taken such a hit over the last six weeks? </p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I think that you have to look at which companies are leading this. And as you point out, it's being led by the big tech companies. Now, they were the ones that were leading the market over the last few years. They led it up. They're now leading it down. </p><p>The rise of these companies was predicated on the fact that they're very loosely regulated, right? I mean they've been allowed to kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies haven't. They've also been very global. I mean these are the most global companies. </p><p>[06:40:10] We are now in a situation where trade is becoming an issue. There's a U.S./China trade war. It's very much a tech war. These companies are really in the front lines of that. So all the things that led them going up are now in question. </p><p>BERMAN: It's fears of the future to an extent.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which is also beginning to happen a little bit in retail, right? Thanksgiving is tomorrow which means the Christmas rush is on. And Target lowered its sales forecast, which caused a lot of people, I think, to raise their eyebrows and say, hey, what's going on here? </p><p>MOORE: Yes, well, look, I only have a master's degree in the Christine Roman's School of Economics. But, look, you made a key point, there is a difference between the real economy and the financial economy. And the -- one of the most important points I think is if you look at the real economy, things still look really good to me. I mean construction is really good. Manufacturing is good. Industrial production is good. Consumer confidence is good. </p><p>Now you mentioned a good point, the market got spooked yesterday and the day before by some, you know, preliminary bad news on consumer spending. This -- this next two weeks for retailers is everything, right? And Black Friday is huge. And so some of the big, big retail companies were reporting some disappointing numbers. But we'll know much better --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: You know, a week from now about how -- but, look, I went to the mall on Friday. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I couldn't find a parking space, you know. So people are going out there. Maybe they're just not buying. </p><p>BERMAN: There we go. Every economics' PhD is like go -- putting their head in their face right now and saying, no, that's not research. But just to be clear, the Target news, you're absolutely right about -- about the economy until this point over the last several years, but that's why that news from Target doesn't fly in the face of it, but it -- but it --</p><p>MOORE: It's true. It's confounding.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MOORE: But, you know, the one piece -- I'm not a stock picker, I'm not a stock analyst, but I always, you know, tell people, if you're in the stock market for the long term, you know, five years, 10 years, don't even -- my wife looks at these returns every day, but don't do that.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, my gosh. A disaster. You cannot do that.</p><p>MOORE: And when you get a -- when you get a dip in the market, that's not a bad time -- I'm actually kind of bullish on (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: That's the other thing that's kind of confounding about this dip in the stock market. Earnings for the companies, which is, as Larry Kudlow likes to say, earnings are the mother's milk in the stock market, those have been pretty good. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, some of it has to do with interest rates too, right?</p><p>MOORE: That's true.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, I mean we're -- </p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>FOROOHAR: We're about to go through a turn. And we knew that's been coming. Christine Romans School of -- PhD. And if that happens, stocks are probably going to correct, right, because the stock markets like low interest rates. Companies can do more business. They can borrow and buy back their own shares and that raises prices. But if rates go up, that could change things. </p><p>MOORE: But that's, by the way, a big bone -- we've had this discussion on this show many times. You know, I happen to agree with Trump, I think that the Fed has been too tight on interest rates. And if you kind of trace -- because this bear market, it kind of started actually about six weeks ago. And it really did kind of start with when the Fed started raising rates. And, you know, I don't see a lot of inflation out there. I think that the Fed is kind of afraid of growth. And I think that's tied to this bearish market. </p><p>BERMAN: There are two other things, though that are connected to it. And, Rana, you alluded to the first one, which is the idea of a trade war.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Which, again, investors are looking long term and saying, you know what, this may start to bite soon.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: This might start to cut into profits. It might start to hurt the real economy.</p><p>FOROOHAR: For sure. And it's going to depend on which sector you're talking about. I mean I think tech stocks are really going to be quite vulnerable. I think some of the most global companies will be very vulnerable. Things like health care, retail, maybe not so much. Things that are U.S.-based not so much. </p><p>But, yes, there's a lot in the market. I mean most Fortune 500 companies today make most of their profits overseas. So if you start getting into a situation where it's not business as usual, then these companies are going to take a hit. </p><p>BERMAN: And right now the United States is doing better than the rest of the economies around the world largely --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>BERMAN: So we're a safe haven, we're an island of stability. But sometimes that can just flip on a moment's notice and we can get dragged down.  FOROOHAR: Well, it can. And, you know, I mean -- we were talking earlier about how the real economy and the stock market are separate, but I'm really interested to see how much affect a fall in the market, which, you know, a lot of people have a lot of money in the market right now, how is that going to affect the real economy? I mean, you know, some people think that if you see a big correction, it could really affect consumer spending. </p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: There's a wealth effect.</p><p>Now, on this issue of the trade, I mean this is a great point. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I mean the -- the investors are watching like every day what's happening with these negotiations between Trump and Beijing on China. I'm not one who thinks that there's going to be an immediate resolution to this.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I agree with that.</p><p>MOORE: It's a long-term. You know, but I will say this, if Trump can pull this off, and he can get a deal with China, then it's just going to be, shew (ph), the stock market's going to go through the roof. </p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Now when that's going to happen, none of us know. </p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Whether it's going to happen in six months, or three months or a year. But I do think in the end, there will be a deal. And when that happens, I think people are going to feel -- investors are going to feel very relieved. </p><p>BERMAN: Me time. Me time. We could even talk about the budget deficit, which is whole other issue, which we can talk about soon because it's just going to go up.</p><p>[06:45:00] MOORE: We don't want to depress people the day before Thanksgiving.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, another (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BERMAN: But that's the point, it's just going to go up, and I think that's hanging over peoples' heads, too, as they think about long term. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Let them digest Thanksgiving dinner and then we'll come back to it.</p><p>BERMAN: Rana Foroohar, Stephen Moore, great to have you with us. </p><p>FOROOHAR: Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. </p><p>MOORE: You too. Thanks.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I hope Christine Romans was watching. I'm going to alert her.</p><p>OK, meanwhile, to this story. After a year of apologizing for FaceBook's missteps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is sounding more defiant. A \"New York Times\" report claims that FaceBook was not transparent about Russian interference in the 2016 election. It also revealed the company hired a PR firm to dig up dirt on its competition. Now, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall, Zuckerberg dismissed questions about his own performance and about the leadership of COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: There are a lot of questions now about Sheryl Sandberg's role in the latest controversy. Can you definitively say Sheryl will stay in her same role? </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: Yes, look, Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest efforts that -- the biggest issues that we have. So when you look at a lot of the progress that we've made over the last 12 to 18 months on issued around elections or content or security, Sheryl was leading a lot of that work. And she's been an important partner for me for ten years. And, you know, I'm really proud of the work that we've done together. And I hope that we work together for decades more to come. </p><p>SEGALL: You are CEO and chairman of FaceBook. That's an extraordinary amount of power given that you rule a kingdom of 2 billion people digitally. Shouldn't your power be checked? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. I think that ultimately the issues that we're working on here, you know, things like preventing interference in elections from other countries, finding the balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe, these are not issues that any one company can address. </p><p>SEGALL: So you are not stepping down as chairman? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: That's not the plan. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Zuckerberg also says FaceBook has a different world view than some of the people who cover the company. What does that mean? A lot more of our CNN exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg ahead on NEW DAY.</p><p>BERMAN: So what was with that answer, that's not the plan? </p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't know. </p><p>BERMAN: When a no -- a no would work. </p><p>CAMEROTA: What was with the Cheshire grin?</p><p>BERMAN: I don't know.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Let's find out.</p><p>BERMAN: Much more next hour. </p><p>So you're going to want to check your refrigerator after this next segment.

The international police agency, Interpol, elected acting president Kim Jong-yang to permanently take the role. Members of the agency rejected a Russian official who was expected to get this job. U.S. and European critics had opposed the Russian official's candidacy over concerns that he would use the position to target the Kremlin's political foes. </p><p>BERMAN: The death toll from the so-called Camp Fire in California has now risen again to 81 people, 870 people are still unaccounted for. And that number, that is very high. Sheriff deputies say they are still trying to get a backlog of voicemails. The Camp Fire is now 75 percent contained. Heavy rain is predicted in northern California into Saturday. That could help with air quality but authorities are worried about mudslides. </p><p>CAMEROTA: New financial disclosures filed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, reveal close to $1 million in payments from a conservative group that he founded in 2014. The group was known, ironically, as FACT, and it received almost all of its funding from a dark money organization which got at least some of its funding from major Republican donor Charles Koch. Most of Whitaker's income in the past few years came from that conservative group, although CNN also paid him $15,000 as a legal commentator in 2017. The disclosure's magnify the concerns over whether the Senate would ever confirm Whitaker if the president nominated him as permanent attorney general. </p><p>BERMAN: Of course there is no confirmation hearing on this because he's only been nominated or selected as an acting attorney general, which is the issue. Which is the issue. All this kind of stuff would come up in a confirmation hearing which will not exist. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a statement, issuing a major food warning just before Thanksgiving. It says do not eat romaine lettuce at all because it could be contaminated with E. Coli. CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins u now. This is a big, widespread warning, Elizabeth. </p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, John.</p><p>Usually you see these things for a particular brand or a particular lot of food, but this is just all romaine lettuce. And let's take a look at the map to see how widespread this is. There have been cases in 11 states going all the way from Massachusetts to California, 32 people sick and the culprit is not just E. Coli, it's E. Coli 015787, a particularly vicious strain of E. Coli that can cause your kidneys to really basically shut down. Of the 32 people who have been sick, 13 have been hospitalized, one of them has had kidney damage. </p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: And, Elizabeth, how close are investigators to pinpointing the source of all this contamination? </p><p>COHEN: You know what, John, they are not close at all. All they can say is just it's romaine lettuce from somewhere. And you may remember that exactly a year ago there was also an outbreak of E. Coli in romaine lettuce, and a year later they still don't know where that came from. The best they can say is that it's from multiple outlets in Arizona, California and Mexico. So even a year later, with the outbreak last year, they still don't know where it came from. </p><p>BERMAN: All right, Elizabeth Cohen for us. Thank you very much.</p><p>In the meantime, you know, be careful. Be careful what's in your refrigerator. </p><p>Thanks, Elizabeth.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John, another case of President Trump attempting to abuse his power.

Latin America is no exception, and has been particularly affected due to very high infection numbers. With more than  and , the region has been described as the world\u2019s worst hit region. That is why, according to the , the Latin American economy will contract 7.2% in 2020 as a whole.    What\u2019s more, some of the promising, if modest, trends of the last two decades are being reversed by the pandemic. This was a region that was starting to reduce huge levels of inequality thanks to significant economic growth from the commodity boom that ended in 2013,  some innovative wage policies and social programmes introduced by progressive governments.    Within this context, younger people are being especially . School closures are hurting education and, as in many countries, job prospects for them are particularly bad. If the region cannot control the virus and kickstart its economy, we will see the growth of a \u201clockdown generation\u201d, trapped in unemployment, informal jobs and in-work poverty.   Unemployment and the gig economy   Both the quantity and quality of jobs are deteriorating rapidly as a result of the economic paralysis created by the pandemic. The UN\u2019s International Labour Organization  the health crisis will push unemployment rates in the region up from 8.1% to 11.5% in 2020, the equivalent of more than 11.5 million newly unemployed.    As a result, an extra 30 million are expected to fall into poverty (and these estimates were made in May, before the effects of the virus really took hold). Young people will be disproportionately affected,  been enduring unemployment rates that were three times higher than that of older adults before the pandemic.    But it\u2019s the historically high level of informal work in Latin America that will make the recovery much more difficult. Before the pandemic, more than half of the workforce across the region was in informal and precarious employment, with no social protections like sick pay or even written contracts. Again, young people make up an even higher proportion of this informal workforce.   Young people are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of coronavirus.  EPA-EFE/JUAN IGNACIO RONCORONI   With economies contracting due to the pandemic, even more people are turning to  throughout the region in search of a daily income. But this . Relying on work as a courier, taxi driver or providing cleaning services through an app was already a tough job. It\u2019s generally low-paid and circumvents minimum-wage laws, as workers are classed as self-employed or they simpy work outside of all national labor laws. It\u2019s precarious, offering no job security or benefits like sick pay or paid holidays. It\u2019s also very isolating, as you are generally working on your own, and it offers very little in the way of career prospects.   Risks and rewards   With the pandemic, the risks involved with gig work increased considerably as these workers come into contact with so many different people. But the pandemic also brought demand for these services, with more people ordering groceries and takeaways under lockdown, or taking taxis instead of public transport.    Yet life as a gig worker has not improved. Across Latin America these key workers have reported a lack of support in terms of personal protective equipment and health insurance. Huge numbers also say their incomes have stayed the same or even worsened, despite carrying out more jobs. In  of 298 drivers across 29 cities, 64% said their pay had dropped. This is due to changes in the terms offered by companies.   Delivery drivers demonstrate in Mexico City to demand job improvements amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Sashenka Gutierrez/EPA-EFE   Thousands have protested for better pay and rights. The last couple of months have seen strikes by delivery drivers in cities across the region, including , ,  and Mexico. Different app companies operate there but the demands are the same: for better pay from the companies and better regulation from governments to prevent exploitation.    The lack of regulation is a big part of the problem. It allows the dark side of the gig economy to develop: a growing pool of workers with no employment protection, underpaid with few other job options, and little power to negotiate with big tech companies managing their workforce through algorithms.    Latin America\u2019s recovery from coronavirus will require significant change to the region\u2019s labour markets. Without better protection from underemployment and in-work poverty, the region risks making inequality worse again.

Latin America is no exception, and has been particularly affected due to very high infection numbers. With more than  and , the region has been described as the world\u2019s worst hit region. That is why, according to the , the Latin American economy will contract 7.2% in 2020 as a whole.    What\u2019s more, some of the promising, if modest, trends of the last two decades are being reversed by the pandemic. This was a region that was starting to reduce huge levels of inequality thanks to significant economic growth from the commodity boom that ended in 2013,  some innovative wage policies and social programmes introduced by progressive governments.    Within this context, younger people are being especially . School closures are hurting education and, as in many countries, job prospects for them are particularly bad. If the region cannot control the virus and kickstart its economy, we will see the growth of a \u201clockdown generation\u201d, trapped in unemployment, informal jobs and in-work poverty.   Unemployment and the gig economy   Both the quantity and quality of jobs are deteriorating rapidly as a result of the economic paralysis created by the pandemic. The UN\u2019s International Labour Organization  the health crisis will push unemployment rates in the region up from 8.1% to 11.5% in 2020, the equivalent of more than 11.5 million newly unemployed.    As a result, an extra 30 million are expected to fall into poverty (and these estimates were made in May, before the effects of the virus really took hold). Young people will be disproportionately affected,  been enduring unemployment rates that were three times higher than that of older adults before the pandemic.    But it\u2019s the historically high level of informal work in Latin America that will make the recovery much more difficult. Before the pandemic, more than half of the workforce across the region was in informal and precarious employment, with no social protections like sick pay or even written contracts. Again, young people make up an even higher proportion of this informal workforce.   Young people are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of coronavirus.  EPA-EFE/JUAN IGNACIO RONCORONI   With economies contracting due to the pandemic, even more people are turning to  throughout the region in search of a daily income. But this . Relying on work as a courier, taxi driver or providing cleaning services through an app was already a tough job. It\u2019s generally low-paid and circumvents minimum-wage laws, as workers are classed as self-employed or they simpy work outside of all national labor laws. It\u2019s precarious, offering no job security or benefits like sick pay or paid holidays. It\u2019s also very isolating, as you are generally working on your own, and it offers very little in the way of career prospects.   Risks and rewards   With the pandemic, the risks involved with gig work increased considerably as these workers come into contact with so many different people. But the pandemic also brought demand for these services, with more people ordering groceries and takeaways under lockdown, or taking taxis instead of public transport.    Yet life as a gig worker has not improved. Across Latin America these key workers have reported a lack of support in terms of personal protective equipment and health insurance. Huge numbers also say their incomes have stayed the same or even worsened, despite carrying out more jobs. In  of 298 drivers across 29 cities, 64% said their pay had dropped. This is due to changes in the terms offered by companies.   Delivery drivers demonstrate in Mexico City to demand job improvements amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Sashenka Gutierrez/EPA-EFE   Thousands have protested for better pay and rights. The last couple of months have seen strikes by delivery drivers in cities across the region, including , ,  and Mexico. Different app companies operate there but the demands are the same: for better pay from the companies and better regulation from governments to prevent exploitation.    The lack of regulation is a big part of the problem. It allows the dark side of the gig economy to develop: a growing pool of workers with no employment protection, underpaid with few other job options, and little power to negotiate with big tech companies managing their workforce through algorithms.    Latin America\u2019s recovery from coronavirus will require significant change to the region\u2019s labour markets. Without better protection from underemployment and in-work poverty, the region risks making inequality worse again. Listening to the demands of striking gig workers is a good place to start.    \u2013 ref.

Tellier Chair in Business and Public Policy, L\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa/University of Ottawa    On July 29, the heads of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google  to defend their dominant market positions in advertising (Facebook and Google), in e-commerce (Amazon) and in applications (Apple).    The hearing was part of the subcommittee\u2019s 13-month investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market power and anti-competitive practices.    Remarkably, the next day, the four companies announced , beating analysts\u2019 expectations. While the economy tanked because of the pandemic, the four companies reported a combined profit of US$28.6 billion in the second quarter.    As a group, their market value is now , making them the most valued companies in the world.    Traditional antitrust measures are not a feasible solution for taming Big Tech\u2019s market power in the data-driven economy. This is because they do not address the source of these firms\u2019 power: data.    An effective way to create a more competitive data-driven economy is to make user data easily accessible to anyone with a legitimate purpose. Data usage may be controlled by a strict regulatory regime modelled on securities regulation that protects the integrity and anonymity of publicly available data.   Bigger, richer, more powerful   The networks these firms provide and the data they collect make them the best at selling access to consumers. If all your friends are on Facebook, you have to be on the platform if you want them to see what you\u2019re doing and thinking and vice versa. If Amazon is where you can find the most products to buy online, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to shop.    It\u2019s also where merchants are going to want to sell their products to you. You want to search for something on the web, you go to Google, because everyone uses Google.

(Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)   As the number of people using online products and services grows,  about them, their preferences and their behaviour. This translates to a more tailored experience to meet people\u2019s specific needs, wishes and interests, which leads to more people joining the network and further data generation.    More people and data mean more money, which means more acquisitions of potential competitors or their technology, thereby adding further people and data to a network.   Taming Big Tech\u2019s power, restoring competition   such as breaking up Big Tech firms and preventing potential competitor acquisitions are never-ending processes. Even if you break them up and block their ability to acquire other, smaller tech firms, Big Tech will start growing again because of network effects and their data advantage.    And how do we know when a tech firm is big enough to ensure competitive markets? What are the size or scope thresholds for breaking up firms or blocking mergers and acquisitions?

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Evan Vucci, Jeff Chiu, Jens Meyer)   A small startup acquired for millions of dollars can be worth billions of dollars for a Big Tech acquirer once integrated in its ecosystem. A series of small acquisitions can result in a dominant position in one area of the digital economy. Knowing this, competition/antitrust authorities would potentially have to examine every tech transaction, however small.    Not only would this be administratively costly or burdensome on resources, but it would also be difficult for government officials to assess with some precision (and therefore legitimacy), the likely future economic impact of an acquisition in a rapidly evolving technological environment.   Open data access, level the playing field   Given that mass data collection is at the core of Big Tech\u2019s power as gatekeepers to customers, a key solution is to open up data access for other firms so that they can compete better.    Anonymized data (to protect an individual\u2019s privacy rights) about people\u2019s behaviour, interests, views, etc., should be made available for free to anyone wanting to pursue a commercial or non-commercial endeavour. Data about a firm\u2019s operations or performance would, however, remain private.    Using an analogy from the finance world, Big Tech firms act as insider traders. Stock market insiders often possess insider (or private) information about companies that the public does not have. Such individuals then have an incentive to profit by buying or selling shares in those companies before the public becomes aware of the information.    Big Tech\u2019s incentives are no different than stock market insiders. They trade on exclusively available private information (data) to generate extraordinary profits.   A stock trader, left, adjusts his mask as he enters the New York Stock Exchange the day soaring profits were reported by Big Tech companies.  (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)   Continuing the finance analogy, financial securities regulators forbid the use of inside or non-publicly available information for personal benefit. Individuals found to illegally use such information are .    They also require companies to publicly report relevant information that affects or could significantly affect their performance. Finally, they oblige insiders to publicly report when they buy and sell shares in a company in which they have access to privileged information.    Transposing stock market insider trading regulation to Big Tech implies that data access and use should be monitored under an independent regulatory body \u2014 call it a Data Market Authority. Such a body would be responsible for setting and enforcing principles, rules and standards of behaviour among individuals and organizations in the data-driven economy.    For example, a Data Market Authority would require firms to publicly report how they acquire and use personal data. It would prohibit personal data hoarding by ensuring that data is easily portable from one platform, network or marketplace to another. It would also prohibit the buying and selling of personal data as well as protect individuals\u2019 privacy by imposing penalties on firms and individuals in cases of non-compliance.    Data openly and freely available under a strict regulatory environment would likely be a better way to tame Big Tech\u2019s power than breaking them up and having antitrust authorities approving every acquisition that they wish to make.    \u2013 ref.

The chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google  on July 29 to defend their market dominance from accusations they\u2019re stifling rivals. Lawmakers and regulators are increasingly talking about  and possibly breaking the companies up into smaller pieces.    I study the effects of  and livelihoods across 90 countries. I believe  of breaking up big technology companies, as well as , are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions.   Myth 1: Comparing Google with Standard Oil   Arguments for and against antitrust action  as reference points.    The massive , for example, has been referred to as the \u201c.\u201d There are also people who are recalling the 1990s .    Those cases may seem similar to today\u2019s situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace.    Currently, there are two \u201cbig tech\u201d clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by . The other is in China, dominated by  and -maker ByteDance.    This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government  of the U.S. companies from entering its market. And the , blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others.    Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government  on championing its own technology companies.    U.S. companies\u2019 size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.   Myth 2: Antitrust is about money   There are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts.    One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken . The other suggests that regulators should look at the  and potential for  their positions.    Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are , and that Amazon\u2019s marketplace power drives its products\u2019 costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that  is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are .    Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users , rather than just money.    Regulators shouldn\u2019t focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in  and whether customers are .   Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothing   There aren\u2019t just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further.    In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn\u2019t broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.    In the 1956 federal consent decree against the  telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn\u2019t split up. Instead, Bell was required to  to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history \u2013 including the , the  and the  \u2013 became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was  in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread  as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier.    The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn\u2019t break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to , previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement.    Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement,  with competitors\u2019 software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple\u2019s Safari, Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Google Chrome.    Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that \u201c.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up.   Myth 4: COVID-19 and the end of tech bashing   The current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies.
