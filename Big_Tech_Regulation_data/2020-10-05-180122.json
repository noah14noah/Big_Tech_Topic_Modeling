The discussions at this event may cover global economic outlook, financial sector, sustainable development and gender equality.<br/>According to IMF head Kristalina Georgieva, the world economy is experiencing a \"synchronised slowdown\" and in some of the largest emerging market economies such as India and Brazil, the slowdown is even more pronounced this year.</p><p><br/>There is a serious risk that services and consumption could soon be affected as global trade growth has come to a near standstill. On the economic side, discussions on economic policy in turbulent times, global trade and development and the current situation of global value chains (GVCs). <br/>Escalating trade tensions are taking a toll on the global economy and have spread into sensitive areas like technology and currencies. Many central banks have appropriately lowered interest rates, but there are limits with this strategy. No-one can doubt that we are once more living through a period of turmoil. But there has been no comparable questioning of the basic ideas determining economic policy. <br/>The failure to re-examine those ideas risks another financial crisis. Global value chains powered an economic revolution over the past three decades: Growth accelerated, incomes rose, and poverty rates plunged. Today, almost 50% of global trade involves GVCs, but rising trade tensions and uncertainties over market access threaten their future.<br/>On sustainable development, concerns continue to mount over the impact of climate change and central banks are taking action in a range of areas within their mandates. Discussions are going to happen as to how central banks can support fight against climate change.<br/>In relation to sustainable development goals, discussions will evolve on how to get the goals to reality by 2030 and whether the needed financing is in place. It is also expected to cover catalysing environmental, social and governance investment. <br/>The world is suffering a historic loss of biodiversity, threatening nature's ability to supply nutritious food, clean air and water, sustain livelihoods, regulate climate and to act as a buffer against extreme weather. Discussions are expected to happen on how to plan to shape the new global biodiversity framework. <br/>The role of gender equality has drawn attention in recent years. There is a discussion on \"women, work, and leadership\" with IMF head, Kristalina Georgieva.<br/>It will focus on the macro-criticality of gender equality, including the need to increase the presence of women at the highest levels of decision-making, and how to address barriers to women's career growth, such as unpaid work and how it influences women's decisions to enter the labour market.<br/>Discussions are also going to be held on unleashing the potential of women entrepreneurs through finance and markets and promoting women's financial inclusion through capacity development.<br/>On technology discussions are the role of fintech in inclusive growth of economies. Fintech innovators are transforming financial services around the world. While the world has made progress towards universal inclusion, 3bn people are still left out or are poorly served by the formal system. <br/>Fintech promises to play a central role in addressing this gap. Technology enables innovators and incumbent financial service providers to expand access to services, while improving quality. <br/>Rich data offers new ways of evaluating loan eligibility or estimating risk. Advances in technology and connectivity are spurring a new wave of business models. Big Tech are entering fintech. <br/>They bring technology, deep pockets, massive networks, mountains of data, and great user experiences. <br/>The opportunities and the risks that are emerging as the financial sector, is reshaped and how regulatory strategies can be adopted to foster sound, inclusive financial innovation and expand the reach of financial services. <br/><br/>n Dr R Seetharaman is Group CEO of Doha Bank.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/44/157091045083.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/44/157091045083.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-156808668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X85-J8D1-F11P-X4BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

According to Press TV, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted Thursday to roll back net neutrality rules which required internet providers to treat all traffic equally, a move critics say would curb online freedom. </p><p> The FCC, in a three-to-two vote, adopted a proposal by Republican-appointed Chairman Ajit Pai, who said his plan would scrap what he called the \"heavy-handed\" rules, which he argued discouraged investment and innovation.  Appointed by Trump in January, Pai was a fierce critic of the neutrality rules adopted under then President Barack Obama in 2015 and earlier this month unveiled his plan named the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" order.  It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so consumers will not see any of the potential changes right away.  Democratic member of the FCC Mignon Clyburn, one of the two dissenters, charged that the agency was \"handing the keys to the internet\" to \"a handful of multibillion dollar corporations.\"  \u201cI dissent, because I am among the millions outraged,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cOutraged, because the FCC pulls its own teeth, abdicating responsibility to protect the nation\u2019s broadband consumers.\u201d  Critics of the vote believe that internet service providers might take advantage of the freedom to prioritize certain types of web traffic which could ultimately have an effect on speeds or pricing.  Supporters have argued that removing the regulations will boost innovation and competition.  What is net neutrality?  Net neutrality prevents Internet service providers from slowing down connections for people attempting to access certain sites, apps and services, and blocking legal content.  Without the rules, they will no longer have to treat all internet traffic equally, and will be able to prioritize certain websites and services over others.  Some also fear internet service providers will seek to extract higher fees from services that are heavy data users, like Netflix or other streaming services, with these costs passed on to consumers, but new startups without the resources of major companies would be more likely to feel the pain.  Reactions to FCC ruling  Net neutrality activists have staged a series of protests in cities around the US and online, amid fears that dominant broadband providers could change how the internet works.  Many of the world\u2019s biggest internet companies also staged a day of protests earlier this year, to highlight what could happen if net neutrality was ended.  Reddit, for instance, altered its logo to make it look like it was loading extremely slowly, while the likes of Netflix and Amazon added banners to its home page.  Following the Thursday FCC rule, tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google opposed the decision. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.  Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit.  <br/><br/><br/>For more information please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@plusmediasolutions.com\">info@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRGOVN-RLPMN443444720171220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRGOVN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R78-5YP1-J9XT-P1MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400358</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Iranian Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

The private equity maven, however, believes it could be an opportunity for India if the government makes it easier to do business by streamlining processes. Blackstone is one of the largest investors in India, with $16 billion invested in Indian companies so far. In an interview with Vinod Mahanta and Samidha Sharma, the man once called the New King of Wall Street talks about the threat from the virus, Blackstone's India journey, the US-China trade deal and teaching finance to Jack Welch, the legendary GE chief executive who passed away last week. Edited excerpts:You've seen seven different recessions, the Covid-19 virus outbreak is probably leading to an eighth one...The virus will disrupt economic activity globally; it will also lead to modifications in supply chain. </p><p>I have never seen anything like this. We don't know how long the economic impact will be if you create recessions in certain countries. These things (the outbreak) are happening spontaneously and people are reacting in a way we haven't seen before. Meanwhile, things will become cheaper as people's confidence is damaged. That is an opportunity to invest, which almost always happens when you have some down cycle. Certain types of assets will become cheaper, like aeroplanes. If nobody gets on them, airline companies will start having trouble. There is going to be a lot of dislocation other than for a few companies like Alibaba that do all these deliveries in China. They're doing great. The way you'd normally re-stimulate economies is by lowering interest rates, but they're so low (in developed economies), that there's not much firepower left...governments will have to start using budgetary stimulus and spend a lot of money to spend their way out of the downturn...So yes, we're at a point of inflection.As a long-term investor, do you see it as an opportunity for Blackstone to invest at cheaper multiples?At our meetings, we talk about, first of all, what's happening to our existing portfolio, because some of those will temporarily be worthless on a mark-to-market basis. On the other hand, we're discussing what areas are going to become cheaper and taking a look at those. In countries that don't have strong banking systems...companies will have trouble raising money. Blackstone can raise additional money for almost anything because the investment community trusts us. The pressure on companies located where banking systems are under stress is like a piece of good fortune because we're prepared to step in and help those companies as well as buy them.What would you tell your portfolio companies at this time? Will there be correction in the private market?There's a lot of capital of a certain type. Firms like us have raised significant money, it's very hard to raise new money by selling stock when you have this kind of global difficulty. Bonds probably will be relatively easy to sell in jurisdictions that have long-term bonds but not long-term 10-year bonds. The reason is, interest rates are so low that as long as you pay a higher rate, some of them will most probably give you debt money. Equity money will be hard to come by from public sources, but from people like us who have plenty of money for the right type of situation.In your book, What It Takes: Lessons in Pursuit of Excellence, you said you taught finance to legendary GE CEO Jack Welch (who passed away last week) ... What made Welch such a great leader?Jack was a unique talent, like Michael Jordan was in basketball. He was extremely smart, he was an attack oriented, intellectual analyst. He would throw himself into a situation. He always spoke the truth. He could learn faster than anyone I've ever met. He wrote notes to people at the company to add that personal touch. He would always press for decisions, and he was fearless. You don't meet people who are like warriors in civilian life; he had charm and energy. He raised everybody's game. If you were around him...you would sense that you had to play better.You are involved in the US-China deal. How do you think the trade dispute will pan out now that the phase one pact has been signed?The phase one deal was really a breakthrough. It's the first significant trade agreement US and China have done since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Think about this for a second - you know why was there no agreement? USA has agreements with almost everybody. China didn't want an agreement. The fact that China wanted to do something, because it was good for them, is really important. They were quite positive about getting the second phase agreement done. The only problem (was) the virus, which has stopped virtually everything in China. So, that's going to have to wait...the combination of China in great difficulty and US going into elections sort of minimises any prospects that something will happen over the next few months.Over the next five years, what is your forecast on Blackstone's investments in India, including real estate?We are not very mechanistic, and the current financial difficulties...may provide us with more opportunities than we anticipate. So, when we look at doubling our real estate exposure, that can happen in 3-4-5 years. It just depends on what the projects are... I know this sounds a little odd, but we practically have pretty much unlimited ability to deploy money here if the opportunities are good. We are planning on doubling our investment in real estate. We have ended up so far investing $16 billion in India. In fact, our Indian operations have our highest returns in the entire world; so, thank you, India.SoftBank's Masayoshi Son recently tried to raise another $100 billion fund but has had a tough year with the WeWork debacle. Your thoughts?My friend Masayoshi Son raised $100 billion, which is the largest for equity venture investing by a factor of four; he did it right out of the box and it was an astonishing thing. The reason why he did it is, there have been a lot of big tech startups that basically watched what Amazon did. Amazon made no profit for about 20 years and it was like a mystery they just kept growing, they kept pricing their products so low they were forcing other people out of business...They appeared to be unstoppable force... in the tech business, the idea of not making money (and) becoming Jeff Bezos or Amazon might be an attractive model. So, a lot of these companies were started in this last cycle...where they do not make money. I come from a more traditional background where if you do not make money it is something very bad... Masayoshi said, 'I can deploy enormous amounts of money and I will be the only place to go'. He found money with governments and other sources and it was a stroke of genius... Some of the companies that (he has) invested in apparently have not been the right ones at the right time or the right price...but that is just an execution thing. If you were in a business school class, this would get an A plus for strategy. No one else thought about it.Every MNC is now looking at a China plus one strategy after the virus scare and resultant supply chain disruption. Can India benefit?In India, you have not experienced the sense of panic... (seen in) the developed world. What will happen is that supply chains will be more diversified - that does not mean everyone is leaving China, that is not even vaguely possible. There is going to be a list of other places to go. There will also be a number of industries or companies that will make sure more of their supply chain is in their own country, even though it will be more expensive for a country like India. This is really a great potential opportunity, but to realise that opportunity, you really have to get organised and it is not just going to happen because India is a difficult country for people who have not operated in it. There are complex approvals, tough to get things done. For you to win this race, you are going to have to organise differently.What are the big regulatory changes you would like the Indian government to make?I think what I would look for is...addressing the issue of how you get more capital into the banking systems to enable the country to grow faster.

The commission won some praise for standing up to big tech. But theatrics aside, this decision is misguided, harmful to consumers, and almost entirely beside the point. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Start with the alleged offenses. Google licenses its Android software to phone-makers for free. If they want to offer its app store, called Google Play, they must also install a suite of the company\u2019s other products, such as its search engine and web browser. All told, this is a pretty popular trade-off: Android is now used in about 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. </p><p>Europe\u2019s regulators object. \u201cThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits,\u201d says Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. \u201cThey have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\u201d </p><p>This statement is wrong in nearly every particular. </p><p>For starters, Google isn\u2019t unduly inhibiting competition. Android users can select among more than 3 million apps on the Play store, including plenty of alternatives to the Google products that come pre-installed. It may be true, as Vestager says, that few users \u201care curious enough to look for another search app or browser.\u201d But fostering curiosity probably isn\u2019t a job for antitrust regulators. </p><p>More to the point, the decision conceives of competition too narrowly. Android may be a dominant operating system. But because it\u2019s free and open-source, it has vastly expanded the range of choices otherwise available to consumers. Developers around the world have built products using Android \u2014 including many of the 1.6 million Europeans who make apps for a living \u2014 and often offer them free of charge. </p><p>All this, though, is premised on that initial trade-off: Manufacturers get a free operating system; consumers get cheap phones and free apps; and Google gets the resulting data and advertising dollars. If the EC throws a wrench into this cycle by making it harder for Google to serve ads, the likely result is that it will start charging for Android \u2014 thus leading to more expensive phones, reduced innovation and less choice for consumers. </p><p>The damage doesn\u2019t end there. One way Google imposes quality control over this ecosystem is by prohibiting manufacturers from using \u201cforked\u201d or customized versions of Android if they want to keep offering Google\u2019s apps. The EC wants to stop this practice in the interests of competition. Yet doing so would erode security and worsen the problem of \u201cfragmentation,\u201d or inconsistencies across different versions of Android. Neither is in the interests of consumers. </p><p>For all that, the EC\u2019s decision comes about a decade too late to achieve even its stated goals. Because Google\u2019s apps benefit from network effects and the power of big data, they get better as they become more popular. The better they are, in turn, the more people want them. After so many years of Google\u2019s dominance, few consumers want to do without its apps and few manufacturers want to make products that exclude them. No amount of meddling by Europe\u2019s bureaucrats is likely to change that dynamic. </p><p>In imposing this admittedly arbitrary penalty, then, the European Commission is threatening to harm consumers, impede innovation, make life difficult for developers, and undermine the security and usability of applications, all in pursuit of thoroughly implausible goals. If it is solving any problems along the way, it has yet to explain how. </p><p>\u2014 Bloomberg Opinion </p><p>CREDIT: BLOOMBERG OPINION</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYWOS-2074112782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYWOS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW5-H2M1-JBHT-D4T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322651</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Record Jul 23, 2018</copyright><publicationName>Daily Record;

If Trump likes business and capitalism (or pretends to like them), we must hate them. Take over their boards, control their prices, regulate anything they do. As the author notes, Bernie Sanders unceasingly attacks corporations, and Elizabeth Warren is not far behind. </p><p>Cowen says most of the common prejudices against Big Business, which such politicians pander to, are undeserved or overstated. In the first place, corporations are not people with feelings and attitudes. They are legal constructs. The people who work in large companies are not better or worse than people in other walks of life. Businesses encourage us to anthropomorphize them because people find \"a singing raisin\" more persuasive than \"a raisin that just sits in the box.\" But when the raisin behaves like a profit-motivated corporation, we feel betrayed.</p><p>Cowen does not think companies should be devoted to purely mercenary goals - nor, generally, are they. Well-run businesses, he says, encourage employees to engender trust. Market and public pressures induce adherence to diversity and other social goals. He acknowledges the scandals at Theranos, Wells Fargo and other corporations, but asserts that business scarcely has a monopoly on fraud. </p><p>Cowen points out that doctors, on occasion, deliberately overprescribe, and frauds occur in nonprofit as well as for-profit institutions. He provokes us by saying, \"You're more likely to be ripped off by your local TV repairman\" than by McDonald's. If that offends, consider that people in noncorporate contexts also cheat - on their taxes, for instance, or on their dating profiles. </p><p>Cowen thinks the bad name of big banks is \"an overreaction to a single event,\" meaning the mortgage crash and the ensuing recession, in which job totals fell for eighteen straight months. He might have said a little more on that. </p><p>He reminds us that finance performs an important function, allocating the capital of savers. The flaws of the financial system more nearly reflect the traits of Americana writ large: Since the westward expansion, we have been a country of risk takers and (though he does not say this) of hucksters. </p><p>Cowen rejects the familiar protest that business controls government. The biggest budget items, Social Security and Medicare, are favorites with, and demanded by, the voters. This argument overlooks that Business lobbied earnestly for the tax cuts. </p><p>Likewise, Cowen says the fear of monopoly is overstated. Airlines are plenty competitive (I wonder). Big Tech is concentrated but, with the exception of Apple, it does not charge luxury prices. </p><p>Cowen does see problematic concentration in hospitals, cellphone service and cable TV. He also worries that Big Tech might eventually lead to an Orwellian invasion of privacy. His most damning criticism is that, on the whole, \"American business is better at talking people into spending money than at helping them save money.\"</p><p> This criticism is welcome, because Cowen's tone is often fawning and credulous. His subtitle is \"A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero,\" and the love is too evident. He faults corporate critics for seeing only the bad, but Cowen would be more persuasive had he written a critique, as distinct from a sonnet. He lists seven also-ran search engines to suggest that Google faces more competition that you think. </p><p>Really? When is the last time you ran a search with DuckDuckGo? Too often, he seems to be stretching the evidence. He argues that, given the social aspects of the workplace, \"companies are actually responsible for some of our most important relationships.\" But that's a function of work - not of corporate life. People at nonprofits make friends, too. Cowen asserts in defense of Amazon, \"My options as a book consumer never have been better.\" He includes as evidence of a competitive book market the option (which he doesn't condone) of \"illegal downloads of free PDFs.\" Jeff Bezos must rue such defenders. (Bezos founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Cowen is at his most disappointing in defending CEO pay. He buys into the myth of the superstar, claiming that CEOs are not only talented executives, they also are our modern \"philosophers.\" He forgets that people who are worth a lot can still be overpaid. He seems unaware that CEOs who get hugely rewarded over a series of short-term intervals can retire with a great, and undeserved, fortune if their overall performance turns out to be mediocre or worse. That isn't reliance on \"anecdote\" (his swipe at journalists like me who write about examples of CEO excess); it's a systematic flaw. </p><p>I also wish Cowen had said more about income inequality. He celebrates America as \"the world's largest and most successful hedge fund,\" but half of Americans don't participate. He could have made the case that, on balance, Big Business lifts the incomes of the poor and makes the society better, if not fairer. He mostly avoids this urgent subject. </p><p>Nonetheless, Cowen raises trenchant points and his theme is correct. Big Business is not the ogre it is made out to be. It is no more deserving of being scapegoated than are other familiar targets. As 2020 approaches, I especially hope Cowen is read by Democrats. Capitalism remains the best engine of prosperity and growth, and the party of the working woman and man should not abandon it. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:business@washpost.com\">business@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3291dc9c618a11e9bfad36a7eb36cb60</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXH-V531-DXKP-J3V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><timeReceived>2:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009QQH</classCode><className>COWEN GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

It is trusted less than labor unions or (egads) newspapers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among young people, more disapprove of capitalism than favor it. According to much public discourse, including from some presidential candidates, Big Business is corrupt, loathsome and responsible for just about everything bad. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Have we forgotten that business makes the stuff that we consume and enjoy and also gives a great many people jobs? Have we forgotten that the charities that do good works are funded by profits that came from private business - likewise the taxes that fund our schools, Defense Department and national parks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist and prolific blogger, has written a defense of, in particular, American Big Business. \"Big Business\" is a contrarian polemic, a cri de coeur that, he protests, \"ought not to be contrarian at all.\"</p><p>Given how much wealth, opportunity and innovation Big Business has enabled and created, he says it arguably has outperformed any other set of private institutions. You may not agree, but I think he is right that \"business has become underrated.\"</p><p>Cowen could have written this book at any time over the past few years; I suspect its appearance at the start of the 2020 election cycle is no accident. I think he is asking us not to fall into the Trump trap.</p><p>The Trump trap is the urge among President Trump haters to demonize whatever the president is associated with. Cowen is careful to point out that Trump, with his trade wars and anti-immigration hysteria, is no avatar of free-market capitalism. But Trump has done some things that benefit business - namely, tax cuts and deregulation. </p><p>In the current polarized moment, many act as though it must be all or nothing. If Trump likes business and capitalism (or pretends to like them), we must hate them. Take over their boards, control their prices, regulate anything they do. As the author notes, Bernie Sanders unceasingly attacks corporations, and Elizabeth Warren is not far behind. </p><p>Cowen says most of the common prejudices against Big Business, which such politicians pander to, are undeserved or overstated. In the first place, corporations are not people with feelings and attitudes. They are legal constructs. The people who work in large companies are not better or worse than people in other walks of life. Businesses encourage us to anthropomorphize them because people find \"a singing raisin\" more persuasive than \"a raisin that just sits in the box.\" But when the raisin behaves like a profit-motivated corporation, we feel betrayed.</p><p>Cowen does not think companies should be devoted to purely mercenary goals - nor, generally, are they. Well-run businesses, he says, encourage employees to engender trust. Market and public pressures induce adherence to diversity and other social goals. He acknowledges the scandals at Theranos, Wells Fargo and other corporations but asserts that business scarcely has a monopoly on fraud. </p><p>Cowen points out that doctors, on occasion, deliberately overprescribe, and frauds occur in nonprofit as well as for-profit institutions. </p><p>He provokes us by saying, \"You're more likely to be ripped off by your local TV repairman\" than by McDonald's. If that offends, consider that people in noncorporate contexts also cheat - on their taxes, for instance, or on their dating profiles. </p><p>Cowen thinks the bad name of big banks is \"an overreaction to a single event,\" meaning the mortgage crash and the ensuing recession, in which job totals fell for 18 straight months. He might have said a little more on that. </p><p>He reminds us that finance performs an important function, allocating the capital of savers. The flaws of the financial system more nearly reflect the traits of Americana writ large: Since the westward expansion, we have been a country of risk takers and (though he does not say this) of hucksters. </p><p>Cowen rejects the familiar protest that business controls government. The biggest budget items, Social Security and Medicare, are favorites with, and demanded by, the voters. This argument overlooks that business lobbied earnestly for the tax cuts. </p><p>Likewise, Cowen says the fear of monopoly is overstated. Airlines are plenty competitive (I wonder). Big Tech is concentrated but, with the exception of Apple, it does not charge luxury prices. </p><p>Cowen does see problematic concentration in hospitals, cellphone service and cable TV. He also worries that Big Tech might eventually lead to an Orwellian invasion of privacy. His most damning criticism is that, on the whole, \"American business is better at talking people into spending money than at helping them save money.\"</p><p> This criticism is welcome, because Cowen's tone is often fawning and credulous. His subtitle is \"A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero,\" and the love is too evident. He faults corporate critics for seeing only the bad, but Cowen would be more persuasive had he written a critique, as distinct from a sonnet. He lists seven also-ran search engines to suggest that Google faces more competition that you think. Really? When is the last time you ran a search with DuckDuckGo? Too often, he seems to be stretching the evidence. He argues that, given the social aspects of the workplace, \"companies are actually responsible for some of our most important relationships.\" But that's a function of work - not of corporate life. People at nonprofits make friends, too. Cowen asserts in defense of Amazon, \"My options as a book consumer never have been better.\" He includes as evidence of a competitive book market the option (which he doesn't condone) of \"illegal downloads of free PDFs.\" Jeff Bezos must rue such defenders. (Bezos founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Cowen is at his most disappointing in defending CEO pay. He buys into the myth of the superstar, claiming that CEOs are not only talented executives, they also are our modern \"philosophers.\" He forgets that people who are worth a lot can still be overpaid. He seems unaware that CEOs who get hugely rewarded over a series of short-term intervals can retire with a great, and undeserved, fortune if their overall performance turns out to be mediocre or worse. That isn't reliance on \"anecdote\" (his swipe at journalists like me who write about examples of CEO excess); it's a systematic flaw. </p><p>I also wish Cowen had said more about income inequality. He celebrates America as \"the world's largest and most successful hedge fund,\" but half of Americans don't participate. He could have made the case that, on balance, Big Business lifts the incomes of the poor and makes the society better, if not fairer. He mostly avoids this urgent subject. </p><p>Nonetheless, Cowen raises trenchant points and his theme is correct. Big Business is not the ogre it is made out to be. It is no more deserving of being scapegoated than are other familiar targets. As 2020 approaches, I especially hope Cowen is read by Democrats. Capitalism remains the best engine of prosperity and growth, and the party of the working woman and man should not abandon it. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:business@washpost.com\">business@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-d10448f6612111e99412daf3d2e67c6d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXW-CWX1-DYX1-H1F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1196\"/><timeReceived>11:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009QQH</classCode><className>COWEN GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

So, what is the national discourse on the issue?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just how much do Indians care about data privacy? The latest surveys show that a whopping 70 percent of Indian users see data protection as an area of concern, with nearly 60 percent of users worrying about the unauthorised collection of their data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the world's largest consumer of mobile data, these fears are legitimate, given the massive volume of personal information that Indians share online on a daily basis.</p><p>Awaiting a national law on data protection</p><p>The national discourse on the importance of privacy came to a head in 2018, when the Supreme Court of India recognised the 'Right to Privacy' as a fundamental right in the Puttaswamy judgment. However, India is yet to adopt specific legislation that regulates data protection. The proposed 'Personal Data Protection Bill', 2018 (\"PDP Bill\"), notwithstanding its listing for the Budget session, has still not been introduced in Parliament.</p><p>Each day that goes by without a dedicated national data protection law to regulate the use of this data, Indians expose their personal information to greater risks.</p><p>Take the recent case of a state health department exposing the medical records of over 12.5 million Indian women online, without a password. While the sensitive information was removed over a period of three weeks following the discovery of the error, it has been reported that the database continues to be accessible - still without a password.</p><p>In July 2019, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari revealed that the government has collected a total of Rs 65 crore in revenue by selling data related to vehicle registrations and driving licenses. Meanwhile, data leaks hit Aadhaar, India's national ID database, on an almost periodic basis. These leaks explain why Indian consumers have reported feeling more wary about sharing data with the government, as compared to online businesses.</p><p>As these incidents become more frequent, concerns about data privacy, and its lack thereof gather pace. This apprehension is traditionally reserved for cybercriminals, hackers, and big tech companies.</p><p>However, with no specific data protection law in place, India is among the top countries where heightened government surveillance has caused data privacy concerns. This is not to say that tech companies have been left unaffected.</p><p>The Central government in 2018 introduced draft rules that empower law enforcement agencies to direct online platforms to trace the origins of encrypted messages, monitor, and hand over personal data, and also remove content deemed unlawful within 24 hours.</p><p>The proposed rules face considerable opposition from industry and civil society alike, who believe that they violate our freedom of speech and privacy rights.</p><p>Privacy versus convenience</p><p>While businesses and the government scramble to safeguard personal data and privacy, the average Indian's apprehensions about the misuse of personal data continue to grow. This concern is best exemplified by the case of 49-year-old Ramesh Kurhade, who refused to comply with a government rule mandating the linking of Aadhaar with salary accounts, causing his salary to be withheld.</p><p>Three years later, the Mumbai Port Trust employee's determination to protect his personal information paid off. The Bombay High Court recently directed the Mumbai Port Trust to pay simple interest of 7.5 percent on his salary, which had been delayed for nearly thirty months.</p><p>However, Ramesh Kurhade may well be the exception, rather than the rule. While the slew of recent studies suggests an awareness of the fundamental right to privacy, most respondents did not know how to exercise this right, or what constituted a violation of it.</p><p>The studies indicated that the respondents were not reading privacy policies or taking appropriate action to protect their personal information. In fact, studies indicate that 7 out of 10 Indian consumers are willing to share their personal information with banks in exchange for lower pricing.</p><p>That many Indians seem willing to trade their privacy in exchange for convenience is a worrying trend, one that can only be dealt with through effective consumer education. If the PDP Bill is to truly cater to Indians' privacy interests, it must facilitate effective public education on informational privacy rights and enable their enforcement.</p><p>(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRSTRY-0049047701</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRSTRY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTW-J6G1-DXMP-K54F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389309</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yourstory.in, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yourstory.in</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 15, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001URE</classCode><className>NATIONAL SUPER SERVICE CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002HTC</classCode><className>NATIONAL LATEX PRODUCTS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS333318 OTHER COMMERCIAL &amp;

Themed 'Are all the independent directors truly independent' the event was attended by Chairmen, Board members and CEOs of Waqf Fund member institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr. Nabil El-Hage, an expert on corporate governance and a former professor of Harvard Business School, led the workshop. He presented four cases and an article during the session, including the case of an insurance company, a Big Tech company, a toy manufacturer and a GCC-based family owned conglomerate. These cases presented real life situations for independent directors and invoked interesting discussion among the participants about how they would respond. Another topic discussed was directors' diversity and business expertise. The key lessons learned from these case studies are mentioned below:</p><p>1. Independence is essentially a state of mind, but the importance of structures and incentives cannot be ignored. If an independent director is paid in equity then his independence can be compromised.</p><p>2. If a person is an independent director on the parent company's Board he may be nominated as independent director for its subsidiary's Board, but not its associates. Nevertheless, it is not a clear-cut situation.</p><p>3. When a CEO nominates his father's best friend as Chairman of the company or his own best friend, he may not be breaching any law or regulation but the nominees may not be considered as truly independent.</p><p>4. Regulators may need to place a ceiling on the number of years a person can remain as an independent Board member of a company. To be more effective companies may use a search firm to look for independent directors.</p><p>5. Independent directors should not be afraid of asking tough questions especially when there is a whiff of self-dealing or when the CEO's or CFO's actions raise questions about their duty of loyalty.</p><p>6. It is important to design the CEO's performance incentives (Key Performance Indicators) correctly and carefully in order to elicit the kind of behavior that the Board wants to encourage. People do what you pay them to do.</p><p>7. To be effective on a Board the independent director needs to build rapport and form alliances with other Board members (remember Warren Buffet's quote - 'Boards are 50% business enterprises and 50% social clubs').</p><p>8. The job of an independent director becomes more difficult if other directors are conflicted or do not fully appreciate what is going on (due to lack of understanding of the business).</p><p>9. The independent director should reassess whether he/she wants to remain in the Board in certain situations, e.g. overly defensive CEO while the other Board members are overly protective or accept management viewpoint unquestioningly.</p><p>10. An independent director must be clear in his mind about his reasons to join a Board, what he is willing to do and what he is not willing to do.</p><p>11. Regulators may consider taking a more proactive role to increase the effectiveness of independent directors.</p><p>12. Diversity of opinions, backgrounds and perspectives on a Board is a very welcome thing and should always be encouraged.</p><p>13. Board members must remember their duties of candor, care and loyalty - always make full disclosures, always be informed, always put the company's interest first.</p><p>14. When a company becomes insolvent or approaches the \"zone of insolvency\" the directors need to prioritize the creditors' interests ahead of the shareholders'.</p><p>15. Boards can rely on the management for facts, but they are entitled to question the management's judgment.</p><p>The Waqf Fund, which hosted the workshop, has been serving the Islamic finance industry in Bahrain since 2006. It offers several programs targeted to Islamic finance practitioners, Shari'ah resources and other stakeholders. The Waqf Fund has 22-member institutions including the Central Bank of Bahrain.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from 24*7 News.

But unlike banks, their parent companies are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means those companies are not subject to any federal supervision, regulations or standards. For this reason, there has historically been considerable opposition to the charter, and both Congress and the FDIC have placed temporary moratoria on ILCs.</p><p>Big Tech company ownership of an ILC introduces a new concern: that consumer data, including sensitive personal financial information, will be inadequately safeguarded and used in inappropriate and unauthorized ways. With global e-commerce giant Rakuten recently joining tech firms such as Square and Nelnet in applying to form ILCs, the risk associated with this legal loophole is greater than ever.</p><p>\"In the era of dominant Big Tech, we should be cautious before giving technology companies even greater reach into the economic life of Americans by allowing them to own banks,\" the groups wrote. \"The integration of technology and banking firms would not only result in an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets but also would pose conflicts of interest and privacy concerns to our banking system.\"</p><p>The groups further noted, \"A growth in ILCs poses broader consumer protection risks as well, because non-bank lenders, including very high-cost lenders, view the ILC charter as a far easier way to obtain banking privileges than obtaining a traditional bank charter and, consequently, becoming subject to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision.\"</p><p>In March, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to parent companies of industrial banks and industrial loan companies. BPI, CRL, ICBA and a coalition of civil rights groups wrote to the FDIC requesting that the FDIC not approve ILC deposit insurance applications until its ILC rulemaking is final. However, in recent months, the FDIC has approved some ILC applications and is reviewing others, including some whose parent companies engage in commercial activities.</p><p>The moratorium can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BPI-CRL-ICBA-ILC-Letter-re-Moratorium-2020.07.29.pdf\">https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BPI-CRL-ICBA-ILC-Letter-re-Moratorium-2020.07.29.pdf</url></p><p>[Category: Financial Services]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7192755 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7192755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-HGJ1-JC11-1038-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><timeReceived>5:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The ILC loophole in the Bank Holding Company Act allows commercial interests to own full-service banks, avoid consolidated supervision, and threaten the financial system. Conditions imposed by the FDIC, whether in the approvals or the proposed rule, are insufficient to alleviate these concerns.</p><p>\"To mitigate risks to the financial system, ICBA continues to call on the FDIC to refrain from approving any additional deposit insurance applications submitted by ILCs until the proposed rulemaking is finalized. Further, the FDIC should hold a hearing on each of the remaining ILC applications and require applicants' owners and affiliates to commit to divesting their commercial interests and meeting the same restrictions as community bank holding companies.</p><p>\"In a comprehensive white paper issued last year, ICBA fully detailed the transformation of the ILC charter into the fashionable charter of choice for fintech and Big Tech firms seeking to benefit from the federal safety net while avoiding legal restrictions and company oversight.</p><p>\"Recognizing the dangers of mixing banking and commerce, both the FDIC and Congress have previously placed moratoriums on the use of ILCs. ICBA continues to strongly support legislation that would permanently close the ILC loophole. Introduced by Senate Banking Committee member John Kennedy (R-La.), the Eliminating Corporate Shadow Banking Act of 2019 would support a safe and sound financial system, level the regulatory playing field between ILCs and community banks, and maintain the important separation of banking and commerce.</p><p>\"ICBA looks forward to continuing to work with all concerned policymakers to close the ILC loophole and maintain the separation of banking and commerce.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>About ICBA</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America(R) creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. With more than 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute 99 percent of all banks, employ nearly 750,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties. Holding more than $5 trillion in assets, nearly $4 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.4 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their customers' dreams in communities throughout America.

Of the 1,000 \"smart cities\" currently being built worldwide, half are in China, according to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/public-sector/articles/super-smart-city.html#\"> a report </url>released earlier this year by Deloitte.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the term \"smart city\" can mean different things to different people, it generally refers to any place that employs internet-connected sensors and other gizmos to make it more convenient to live in and easier to manage. A smart city project can be anything from parking spaces capable of alerting nearby drivers when they are open to widespread use of surveillance equipment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While China's efforts have so far focused on building smart city projects and developing related industry standards at home, local governments have grown increasingly interested in reaching out overseas in search of business opportunities.</p><p>These efforts were laid bare late last month at the three-day Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona, where dozens of Chinese cities sent officials to attend, giving China an unprecedented presence at the event. In 2013, one Chinese exhibitor attended. This year, 48 showed up, taking up 15% of the expo's available floor space.</p><p>\"After years of technological advancement in areas such as telecommunications, Chinese governments are now more willing to work with the West and are more open in global cooperation,\" said Luis Miao, head of the China region at Fira de Barcelona, the organizer of the annual expo.</p><p>Industry experts, however, said concerns about China's ambition to export its surveillance technology, as well as different mindsets about the issue of data privacy could be obstacles to China and Europe working together more closely on smart cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> City-to-city cooperation </emphasis></p><p>Initially flagging the smart city concept in 2008, Beijing made creating smart cities a national development strategy in 2015, when President Xi Jinping endorsed the concept at a national urbanization convention.</p><p>While the technologies touted for use in smart city projects are roughly the same, such as artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT), there are some key differences between the Chinese and European governments in terms of their approaches to development and areas of focus.</p><p>In China, smart city projects are more focused on public security and digitalization of government services, such as using mobile apps to make services more convenient to citizens, said Lu Hongfeng, deputy director at the Shenzhen Institute of Standards and Technology. In Europe, by contrast, governments are more interested in sustainability and environmental projects, such as deploying intelligent water meters.</p><p>In China, governments tend to partner with big tech companies to take advantage of their large mobile platforms and user bases. For example, Chinese citizens can now pay utility bills, enter subway stations, book doctor appointments and access many other public services through the country's near ubiquitous WeChat \"super app.\"</p><p>Due to the app's large user base, governments only need to sign a deal with WeChat's operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. to roll out a new service.</p><p>This level of convenience for governments in China is largely due to the public's willingness to cede privacy rights to large companies, as well the government, Lu said. \"In Europe, however, these digital services are hard to roll out because privacy remains a much more sensitive issue than in China,\" he said.</p><p>Lu said different mindsets regarding data privacy regulation remain one of main obstacles to more smart-city cooperation between China and Europe. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strictly limits how tech companies and government agencies can collect and use personal data. While in China, most of data-related security guidelines emphasize government scrutiny over online content.</p><p>China's global tech ambitions come as Washington has since this year aggressively sought to push back against the former's efforts by cutting off supplies of technology to some of the county's leading companies, in cluding telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., surveillance-camera maker Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. and a slew of artificial intelligence (AI) startups.</p><p>In a nod to sensitivities regarding cooperation on the state level, Beijing has increasingly shifted focus to collaboration at the local level - in other words, Chinese cities working directly with cities elsewhere. \"More and more Chinese cities are willing to reach out to other global cities,\" Miao said. By cooperating with global platforms like Fira Barcelona - which attracted representatives from 700 cities this year - Chinese cities could also take advantage of opportunities to promote their local businesses by putting them on the global stage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Bringing the business along </emphasis></p><p>Five local Chinese agencies had booths at this year's Smart City Expo in Barcelona, including the little-known city of Huzhou in East China's Zhejiang province.</p><p>With the exception of several well-off companies such as Huawei, most of the Chinese exhibitors at the show were sent and funded by their local governments.</p><p>By participating in the event, they hoped to showcase their products to the overseas market. A sales head at Shenzhen AOA Technology Co. Ltd., a manufacturer of fiber-optic products, told Caixin that his company is currently working with third-party agents to sell products in the European market. \"Our products are widely used in areas such as security. As European governments are pushing a smart city agenda, that would certainly be a benefit for us,\" he said.</p><p>Other Chinese exhibitors in attendance were data management providers such as Shanghai Data Exchange Corp., a firm established in 2016 by Shanghai government to coordinate data among government agencies.</p><p>Although China's presence at the expo was largely a public relations move aimed at an audience back home, these companies still attracted crowds of foreigners to their booths. Many of the visitors were keen to hear about these companies' experiences in China in regard to a common obstacle to smart city projects around the world - fragmented data among different government agencies, Caixin has learned.</p><p>Huawei - which also sells surveillance equipment - has managed to stay on its feet despite sanctions that cut off its access to U.S. technology. At the expo, Huawei, which says it has worked on smart city projects in cities such as Amsterdam and Rome, announced that it will partner with the Barcelona city government to work on smart city projects together.</p><p>\"The European Union has a unified standard for rolling out smart-city projects. As smart city turns from concept to reality in many European countries, the market potential for Huawei is huge,\" Ernest Zhang, who oversees Huawei's enterprise businesses in Western Europe, said in an interview with Caixin.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Caixin's trip to Barcelona, where some of the interviews in this story took place, was partly funded by Fira de Barcelona.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Contact reporter Mo Yelin </emphasis>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yelinmo@caixin.com\">yelinmo@caixin.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAIXIN-101490731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAIXIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNB-3521-DY28-G42T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468180</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1191\"/><timeReceived>8:03 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Caixin Global Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Caixin Global</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

This will no doubt be welcomed after criticism that the loss of ARM Holdings, the first big UK takeover announced after the UK's vote to leave the European Union, was a significant blow for the industry.</p><p>\"Every sector of the FTSE 100 is higher on the Micro Focus deal because it's a good sign for the continued growth of UK business and technology post-Brexit. British firms still have the confidence to buy overseas assets despite the drop in sterling,\" commented Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.</p><p>The deal also brings back to the UK the business of Automony Corp PLC, which was acquired by Hewlett Packard Co in 2011, although Micro Focus will snap up those assets for significantly less than the USD11.7 billion that Hewlett Packard paid.</p><p>The Autonomy deal was controversial for HP, facing scrutiny for its hefty price tag, and ultimately proving even more costly for the US tech giant as it then wrote down USD8.8 billion of the investment, amid accusations of accounting improprieties and misrepresentations by Autonomy. The dispute between Hewlett Packard and Autonomy's Mike Lynch, who left Autonomy in May 2012, became subject to investigations from the UK's Serious Fraud Office and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Micro Focus Executive Chairman Kevin Loosemore told journalists Thursday that it had had no discussions with any managers of Autonomy, and had dealt solely with Hewlett Packard on the acquisition. He also noted that some products it will be acquiring with Autonomy are \"very exciting\", whilst some are more mature. </p><p>Loosemore told journalists that he had approached Hewlett Packard Enterprise following its spin-out from Hewlett Packard, which split into two legal entities late last year serving consumers and business. </p><p>Loosemore said he had contacted HP Enterprise in February, as he was intrigued what their new strategy would be after the separation. HP Enterprise was looking to spin-off the software unit, with a number of private equity firms having been linked with bids for the division, and Loosemore said that HP Enterprise didn't see this part of their business as strategic for their future direction. </p><p>As such, the two parties realised there was potential for a deal to be done. </p><p>Under its terms, HP Enterprise shareholders will be issued American Depositary Shares, giving them a 50.1% share of the combined group following completion of the deal, and HP Enterprise will be paid a pre-completion payment of USD2.5 billion. </p><p>The deal is considered a reverse takeover under UK takeover code, and is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction under US rules, although Loosemore stressed to journalists that it was not the case that HP Enterprise will have a share in the business once the transaction is done, but only that HP shareholders would become Micro Focus's majority shareholders. </p><p>Micro Focus has entered into commitments for a total USD5.5 billion of debt financing related to the deal with investment JP Morgan, including a revolving credit facility of USD500 million.</p><p>The deal is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2017, and is subject to shareholder approval. The companies said that the deal had been unanimously approved by both boards, and Micro Focus's board said it believes the deal is in the \"best interest\" of shareholders.</p><p>Micro Focus said the combined company will generate annual revenue of around USD4.50 billion and annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of USD1.35 billion, creating \"one of the world's largest pure-play infrastructure software companies\".</p><p>The company expects the transaction to enhance its adjusted earnings per share in its first full year from completion, with \"scope for further benefits\" as it realises operational improvements. </p><p>Whilst Loosemore was confident in Micro Focus's ability to improve margins, he noted that, due to regulatory processes required to complete the deal, it won't actually take control of the business for between nine to twelve months. As such it is targeting three years after completion to bring HP Enterprise software's margins in line with the equivalent margin of its own mature software assets. </p><p>Loosemore and Chief Financial Officer Mike Phillips will continue in their positions, and HP Enterprise will be entitled to nominate one executive director to the board, as well as one half of the Micro Focus board's independent non-executive directors.</p><p>Ahead of completion, Micro Focus intends to return USD400 million to its shareholders, equivalent to USD1.68 per share based on the company's fully diluted share capital as at Tuesday, and the company reiterated that it intends to continue its dividend policy of distributions equal to around half of its adjusted net income going forward. </p><p>In addition, Micro Focus said it and HP Enterprise will enter a partnership whereby Micro Focus's SUSE unit will become HP Enterprise's preferred Linux partner.</p><p>Investec analysts Jullian Yates and Roger Phillips said the combination of the two companies will create one of the largest enterprise software businesses in the world. \"There should be scope for significant cost savings but it does bring integration risk considering the quantum of assets being acquired,\" Yates and Phillips said.</p><p>If there is a successful integration, Investec forecasts the deal to be \"materially accretive\" with over USD1.8 billion long-term profit potential.</p><p>Investec placed its rating and forecasts under review for Micro Focus following the deal announcement, but said that on first glance it sees share price potential of between 2,100p and 3,000p depending on the extent of margin uplift.</p><p>By Hana Stewart-Smith; <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hanassmith@alliancenews.com\">hanassmith@alliancenews.com</email>; @HanaSSAllNews</p><p>Copyright 2016 Alliance News Limited.

If a company has a big market cap and is actively traded in the market, it should be included in the index or otherwise the index cannot represent the \u00adlocal market in full,\" said Clement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO.</p><p/><p>\"However, there are concerns from passive fund managers that dual-class shareholding companies do not follow the one share, one vote principle. The index compiler will need to consider the corporate governance and shareholder protection angle.\"</p><p/><p>On the financials sector weighting, the compiler said the industry had dominated the benchmark for some time, with 11 finance stocks accounting for 48.3 per cent of the aggregate weighting in the main index and 34 per cent of the broader Hang Seng Composite Index.</p><p/><p>HSI Company asked in the consultation paper if it should add a cap on individual constituent weightings, such as 8 per cent on a financial constituent or 10 per cent on a company from another sector, or if there should be a cap on the number of constituents in any sector.</p><p/><p>Gordon Tsui, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, agreed with the idea of \u00adreforms that would enable tech giants to join the benchmark \u00adindex, but urged regulators to put in place a limit on each sector to prevent any disproportionate \u00adinfluence on the market.</p><p/><p>\"If they are included in the \u00adindex, they and the financial \u00adsector may dominate the index,\" he said. \"The exchange should add a cap in each sector to make a balanced composition.\"</p><p/><p>There are currently 23 \u00adexchange-listed products tracking the HSI, representing more than US$20 billion in assets under management. On average, more than 280,000 HSI futures and \u00adoptions contracts were traded in Hong Kong daily last year.</p><p/><p>Mainland companies account for 60 per cent of listings, 70 per cent of capitalisation and 80 per cent of trading volume in Hong Kong.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-c2cbe2fe-352d-11ea-9400-58350050ee52</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYX-4721-DYRW-R234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 South China Morning Post Ltd.

Of the 37.68 million videos removed in India, only 225 videos and 8 accounts were removed or blocked at the government's request; all others were removed by TikTok of its own volition, indicating that India led in the creation of violative content. It is unlikely that India's ban on the app had a significant impact on the numbers (more on that below).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">India and USA were followed by Pakistan (6.45 million), Brazil (5.53 million) and United Kingdom (2.95 million) in terms of total videos removed. It removed a total of 104,543,719 (104.54 million) videos globally in the first half of 2020, less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok. Of these, 96.4% were removed before a user reported them and 90.3% were removed before they received any views.</p><p>Reasons for removal: Of the more than 104.54 million videos removed globally, 30.9% (~32.3 million) were removed for showing adult nudity and sexual activities, 22.3% (~23.3 million) for being child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and endangering safety of children, 19.6% (~20.5 million) for showing illegal activities and sale or promotion of regulated goods, 13.4% (~14 million) for showing suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts, and 8.7% (~9 million) for showing violent and graphic content. Other reasons for removal include harassment and bullying (2.5%), hate speech (0.8%), dangerous individual and organisations, and deceptive activities such as spamming, impersonation or disinformation campaigns. (1.2%).</p><p>TikTok revealed this is in its transparency report for the first half of 2020 released on September 22. In the second half of 2019 too, most videos (16.45 million) were removed from India.</p><p>Impact of India's ban on the app?</p><p>India's ban on the app due to national security reasons would have had minimal impact on the numbers since the ban was imposed on June 29, just a day before the first half of the year ended. If the removal of 37 million videos was distributed equally across all days of the first six months, then, on the June 30, another 209,349 videos could have been removed.</p><p>India leads in govt, legal requests for content removal as well</p><p>TikTok's transparency report gives country-specific data for two parameters - law enforcement requests for user information, and government requests for content restrictions.</p><p>TikTok complied with 79% requests for user information in India: Indian law enforcement agencies (LEAs) sent a total of 1206 requests for user information - 1187 normal requests and 19 emergency requests. These requests sought information about 1851 accounts and for 79% of these requests, TikTok gave LEAs some information. For a normal request for user information, LEAs have to provide a valid legal document, such as a subpoena, court order, or warrant, which is then reviewed by TikTok for legal sufficiency. In case of emergency requests, TikTok discloses user information without legal process when it believes there is \"imminent risk of death or serious physical injury to any person\".</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"6\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\" colwidth=\"184\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Period</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Number of Legal Requests</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Number of Emergency Requests</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Total Requests</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Total Accounts Specified</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Percentage where some information was produced</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2020 H1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1187</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">19</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1206</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1851</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">79%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2019 H2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">291</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">302</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">408</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">90%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2019 H1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">107</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">143</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">47%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><br/><br/>* Between 2019 H2 and 2020 H1, legal requests from Indian LEAs grew almost 4 times while the number of accounts specified grew by 4.5 times.

If it doesn't comply, it is removed. If it does comply, TikTok may still restrict access to such content in the country where it is allegedly taken. In case of compliance, the platform may choose to take no action as well.</p><p>Copyright notices: The short video platform gives bulk data for copyright-related takedown notices. It got 10,625 notices globally to remove content that violates different copyright laws and in 89.6% of these requests, it removed \"some\" content.</p><p>'Create an inter-platform hash database of violent content': TikTok</p><p>TikTok's interim head, Vanessa Pappas, who stepped in after Kevin Mayer quit as the CEO in August, wrote to nine unspecified social and content platforms, that they should create an inter-platform database with hashes of violent and graphic content that can be used to reduce the prevalence of such content on different social media platforms. A hash is a unique digital fingerprint of electronic content that can be indexed. In this case, it would mean creating a database of hashes of all identified violent content across the 10 platforms. The platforms would then keep scanning for recurrence of these particular hashes and automatically take the problematic content down. We have reached out to TikTok to find the 9 companies the letter was sent to.</p><p>Big Tech have already started multiple industry-wide coalitions to fight CSAM. In June 2020, Technology Coalition, a group that includes Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc., announced Project Protect.</p><p>The industry also uses a hash-based technology to remove CSAM. PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth University, is used by Google, Facebook, and multiple other technology companies to scan for CSAM. The service, which is also available to child rights organisations and as a service on Microsoft Azure, creates a hash of the illegal image and compares it against hashes of other photos to find copies and take them down. WhatsApp also uses PhotoDNA to scan profile photos of groups for CSAM and remove all accounts within that group.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054540217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XG-6D51-DXMP-K39H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), has passed[2] the Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, which states in part: 'No service provider shall offer or charge discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content.' Though this legislation will apply to all companies, it's clear that Facebook's recent initiatives in the country have played a major part in bringing the new law to pass. </p><p>Facebook's free Internet program, Free Basics[3], has been widely criticized[4] for violating the principles of net neutrality. By handpicking which Internet services are included and which aren't, it's argued that Facebookis serving as the gatekeeper for so-called zero-rating services[5]. Indeed, Facebookitself features prominently in the Free Basics app, meaning locals can access Facebookwithout incurring data charges. While Facebookclaims north of 1.5 billion monthly active users[6] (MAUs), it's approaching a saturation point in many Western markets, which is why it is looking to other markets for growth. Cofounder and CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has been on a huge charm offensive in India[7]\u00a0of late,\u00a0as he eyes the hundreds of millions of people still to come online across the country. 'Our mission is to give everyone in the world the power to share what's important to them and to connect every person in the world,' explained <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>at a Townhall Q...t the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), back in October. 'And India is the world's largest democracy. There are a billion people in India who do not have access to the Internet yet, and if we care about connecting everyone in the world, you can't do that if there are so many people who don't have access to basic connectivity.' While that mission in itself is commendable, the way Facebookhas gone about implementing Free Basics has rankled many. India has been making it clear that it doesn't want Facebook's idea of a walled-garden Internet[8], and now this sentiment has been backed by legislators too.

Open Digital Ecosystems or National Open Digital Ecosystems (NODEs) are frameworks or structures that consist of a set of protocols and digital systems that can be used by government departments, private companies and the public to offer services, collaborate on and innovate new technology solutions.

It has three layers, the tech layers...India has made progress in building a consensus that these need to be modular, interoperable etc. India has progressed here...the second layer is the governance layer,\" said Roopa Kudva, managing director of Omidyar Network India. The governance layer includes entities responsible for creating and maintaining the ODE - such as the government, other regulators and the rules associated with the ODE. \"The third layer is what we call community engagement - entrepreneurs, builders who ensure the infrastructure actually gets used and services and solutions are built on top of it. This also refers to developers and civil society,\" said Kudva. The importance of the community engagement was seen when civil society offered suggestions and improvements after the Aarogya Setu Covid-19 contact tracing app was launched. The report further details the necessary building blocks of ODEs in India and suggests a roadmap for the adoption and implementation of 'responsible' ODEs.

This episode shows that...</p><p>The tussle between tech giant Google and payments unicorn Paytm has put the focus back on India\u2019s competition laws pertaining to digital markets. \u201cFor long, Google and Apple have been exercising too much control over app developers. This episode shows that it can happen anytime and with any apps. This time they played by the rules, but they can always make these decisions to suit their business interests,\u201d said Gurshabad Grover, senior policy officer at Centre for Internet and Society (CIS).    There is \u201cno clear judgement\u201d when it comes to the Play Store and App Store, about whether they are intermediaries, such as Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, Grover said. \u201cIn the Fermat Education vs Sorting Hat Technologies case of 2018, Madras high court specifically said that if you are pre-screening uploaded content or if some sort of money is involved, then you are moving away from the definition of intermediary, which protects you from liability,\u201d he said.    This isn\u2019t the first time Google has been pulled up in India for one of its platforms. The company has run into trouble with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for abusing its dominance with Search in 2018, for monopoly in mobile operating systems in 2019, and even in May for a case against Google Pay. CCI slapped a fine of \u20b9135.6 crore on it for abusing its dominant position in online general web search and web search advertising services.    \u201cWe need to have a modular approach to this. India needs to fix the competition law for the digital market. The 2020 proposed amendments to the competition law are a step in the right direction and the government should implement more of the recommendations by the Competition Law Review Committee,\u201d said Grover.    There is also a lack of clarity in how things work in the digital space. Tech policy advisor Prasanto K. Roy said a clear set of instructions from companies like Google is more important in such cases. \u201cIt appears there were gaps on both sides. Paytm has a different take on what happened, including that Google was classifying scratch cards and cashback as gambling. Google said that was not the case. It is not clear how much time was given. Paytm says zero, Google says otherwise,\u201d he said.    Self-regulation of platforms such as Google is also required, Roy said. \u201cWhy the action is taken should be clear and enough time should be given. When a dominant app in a critical area such as payments is affected, the action should be internally escalated and reviewed,\u201d he said.    CCI is empowered to rein in the power of big tech just like it is done globally. Anisha Chand, partner at law firm Khaitan and Co., said CCI has been investigating various tech companies, including Indian ones, such as Flipkart and MakeMyTrip. \u201cIf the question is whether the regulation can be more robust so that these things can be caught in a more timely manner, the answer is probably yes,\u201d she added.    Regulation of big tech is under question worldwide, Chand said. The struggle regulators face is in finding a method that allows regulation without stifling innovation. \u201cThe challenge is to strike the right balance between an adequate amount of intervention and at the same time ensure that technology players aren\u2019t disincentivized to come up with creative and innovative ways to make our lives better,\u201d Chand said.

In the U.S., the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness  emerged last week (Sept. 24) with a goal of pushing for legal and regulatory changes regarding Big Tech\u2019s app stores, in particular.   In India, the TV channel ET Now reported on Thursday (Oct. 1) that government sources said the move would be part of a bid by the country to become more self-reliant. According to The Economic Times of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government may build up its Mobile Seva App Store for this purpose.   Economic Times sources commented that \"Android has a 97 percent market share in India. So, we should intervene and hand-hold Indian startups.\" The Times newspaper launched ET Now in 2009.   One key feature of the Indian government\u2019s plan: The new app store would not charge the 30 percent fees that Google's and Apple \u2019s stores do.   The formation of the Coalition for App Fairness heightened the war against Apple\u2019s App Store in particular. The coalition targets Apple, saying that \u201cno app store should charge unreasonable or excessive fees.\u201d   The coalition includes such companies as  Spotify , Tinder owner  Match Group  and  Epic Games , maker of Fortnite.   The group argues that the big app stores collect hefty commissions from app developers\u2014 and continue to undercut the competition by giving unfair advantages to their own products and services. The coalition argues on its website that, currently, \u201cOne company has near-total control over the mobile ecosystem and what apps consumers get to use. After nearly a decade with no oversight, regulation or fair competition, it\u2019s time for Apple to be held accountable.\u201d   For its part, Google is looking to lower the boom on apps that have avoided Google Play Store rules on in-app purchase billing. Google wants a 30 percent cut of purchases inside of apps on Android. Spotify, Match Group, Netflix and Epic Games have managed to avoid that commission.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS TV LIVE OCTOBER SERIES: B2B PAYMENTS 2021 \u2013 WHAT WILL YOU CHANGE?

We've been watching our neighbours do the trick for years. It's called export-oriented growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's all about building a big manufacturing sector. You encourage under-employed rural workers to move to the city and take jobs in factories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because your one big economic advantage is an abundant supply of cheap labour, you start by concentrating on making low-cost, simple, labour-intensive items such as textiles, clothing and footwear.</p><p>Since the locals don't have much capacity to buy this stuff, you concentrate on exporting it. Foreigners will lap it up because to them it's so cheap.</p><p>As the plan works and the country's income rises, you plough a fair bit back into raising the education level of your workers, which allows you to move to making more elaborate goods and to paying higher wages. You're on the way to being a developed country.</p><p>Over the decades we've seen a succession of countries climb this ladder: Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, China and now even Vietnam and Bangladesh at the bottom. It's like pass-the-parcel: as each country's labour gets too expensive to be used to produce low-value thongs and  T-shirts, some poorer country takes over and starts the climb to prosperity.</p><p>That's the way it's always done. Except for one country: India. Its economy started growing strongly in the 1990s and now it's the world's third-biggest (provided you measure it correctly, allowing for differences in purchasing power).</p><p>India has got this far without building a big, export-oriented manufacturing sector. It's done something that's probably unique: skipped the manufacturing stage and gone straight to the rich-country stage, in which most growth in jobs and production comes from services.</p><p>The Indians have done it by being so good with software and other information and communications technology and the things that hang off it, such as call centres. It's a big export earner.</p><p>It's an impressive effort, and there's no reason a developing country shouldn't have a big tech sector.</p><p>But, even so, the experts are saying India would be a lot better off if it had a bigger, more vibrant manufacturing sector, employing a lot more people who, by Indian standards, would be on good wages. This is a key theme in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-india.htm\">report on the Indian economy</url>, issued this week.</p><p>The report offers suggestions on what could be done to encourage the growth of manufacturing, which go a fair way towards explaining why manufacturing never really got going the way it did in other \"emerging market economies\".</p><p>First, some basic facts. India has a population of 1250 million and  before long it will  overtake China's. About 29 per cent of the population is younger than  15.</p><p>Manufacturing accounts for only 13 per cent of India's gross domestic product, which is low compared with the other BRIICS emerging economies Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and China, but  not South Africa.</p><p>Indian manufacturing probably accounts for a slightly smaller share of its total employment. Huh? It's normally the other way round. You'd expect it to be quite labour intensive. But despite abundant, low-skilled and relatively cheap labour, Indian manufacturing is surprisingly capital and skill intensive, the report says.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of manufacturing employment is in companies  with fewer than 10 employees. That compares with Brazil's 9 per cent. This tells us the sector's many small firms mean it isn't exploiting its potential economies of scale.</p><p>And, indeed, its manufacturing productivity is low, with productivity 1.6 times higher in China and and 2.9 times in Brazil.</p><p>India's employment in manufacturing hasn't grown much over the years, with the sector hardest hit by the economy's recent slowdown. What new jobs have been created have been \"informal\", with workers not covered by social security arrangements.</p><p>Manufacturing's share of India's \"merchandise\" or goods exports (that is, ignoring the big and rapidly growing exports of IT services) fell from 77 per cent to 65 per cent over the decade to 2013.</p><p>My guess is an important reason for the sector's unusual configuration and weak growth is excessive regulation. India has been and still is a highly, and badly, regulated economy. The socialists' obsession with manufacturing means I wouldn't be surprised if the newer technology sector has taken over the running because, being outside the Left's traditional preoccupations, it wasn't so heavily regulated.</p><p>Some regulation has been removed but, particularly as they apply to manufacturing, India's labour and tax laws, which are tougher on bigger than smaller firms, have inhibited and distorted the industry's development.</p><p>As the report puts it, manufacturing firms have little incentive to employ and grow, since by staying small they can avoid taxes and complex labour regulations.</p><p>A second part of the explanation the report points to is what it calls \"structural bottlenecks\". As with all developing countries, the whole Indian economy suffers under inadequate economic and social infrastructure.</p><p>But manufacturing is particularly reliant on good transport links - more so than the tech sector - and India's transport infrastructure is still bad.</p><p>Every business needs a reliable electricity supply, but manufacturing probably needs it more than most. A business survey has found that 48 per cent of manufacturing firms experience power cuts for more than five hours a week. About 60 per cent of firms feel that erratic power supply affects their competitiveness and they would be willing to pay more for a more reliable supply.</p><p>As usual with developing economies, the list of things that need reform is  long. The challenge for governments is to give priority to the ones that would do <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">most</emphasis>\u00a0 to help, even though everything is interconnected.</p><p>In the case of Indian manufacturing, however, the OECD's top recommendation is to introduce simpler and more flexible labour law, which doesn't discriminate by the size of the enterprise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ross Gittins is the economics editor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-63411900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DN7-B2K1-JB5F-94DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><timeReceived>01:34 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Foreigners will lap it up because to them it's so cheap.</p><p>As the plan works and the country's income rises, you plough a fair bit back into raising the education level of your workers, which allows you to move to making more elaborate goods and to paying higher wages. You're on the way to being a developed country.</p><p>Over the decades we've seen a succession of countries climb this ladder: Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, China and now even Vietnam and Bangladesh at the bottom. It's like pass-the-parcel: as each country's labour gets too expensive to be used to produce low-value thongs and  T-shirts, some poorer country takes over and starts the climb to prosperity.</p><p>That's the way it's always done. Except for one country: India. Its economy started growing strongly in the 1990s and now it's the world's third-biggest (provided you measure it correctly, allowing for differences in purchasing power).</p><p>India has got this far without building a big, export-oriented manufacturing sector. It's done something that's probably unique: skipped the manufacturing stage and gone straight to the rich-country stage, in which most growth in jobs and production comes from services.</p><p>The Indians have done it by being so good with software and other information and communications technology and the things that hang off it, such as call centres. It's a big export earner.</p><p>It's an impressive effort, and there's no reason a developing country shouldn't have a big tech sector.</p><p>But, even so, the experts are saying India would be a lot better off if it had a bigger, more vibrant manufacturing sector, employing a lot more people who, by Indian standards, would be on good wages. This is a key theme in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-india.htm\">report on the Indian economy</url>, issued this week.</p><p>The report offers suggestions on what could be done to encourage the growth of manufacturing, which go a fair way towards explaining why manufacturing never really got going the way it did in other \"emerging market economies\".</p><p>First, some basic facts. India has a population of 1250 million and  before long it will  overtake China's. About 29 per cent of the population is younger than  15.</p><p>Manufacturing accounts for only 13 per cent of India's gross domestic product, which is low compared with the other BRIICS emerging economies Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and China, but  not South Africa.</p><p>Indian manufacturing probably accounts for a slightly smaller share of its total employment. Huh? It's normally the other way round. You'd expect it to be quite labour intensive. But despite abundant, low-skilled and relatively cheap labour, Indian manufacturing is surprisingly capital and skill intensive, the report says.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of manufacturing employment is in companies  with fewer than 10 employees. That compares with Brazil's 9 per cent. This tells us the sector's many small firms mean it isn't exploiting its potential economies of scale.</p><p>And, indeed, its manufacturing productivity is low, with productivity 1.6 times higher in China and and 2.9 times in Brazil.</p><p>India's employment in manufacturing hasn't grown much over the years, with the sector hardest hit by the economy's recent slowdown. What new jobs have been created have been \"informal\", with workers not covered by social security arrangements.</p><p>Manufacturing's share of India's \"merchandise\" or goods exports (that is, ignoring the big and rapidly growing exports of IT services) fell from 77 per cent to 65 per cent over the decade to 2013.</p><p>My guess is an important reason for the sector's unusual configuration and weak growth is excessive regulation. India has been and still is a highly, and badly, regulated economy. The socialists' obsession with manufacturing means I wouldn't be surprised if the newer technology sector has taken over the running because, being outside the Left's traditional preoccupations, it wasn't so heavily regulated.</p><p>Some regulation has been removed but, particularly as they apply to manufacturing, India's labour and tax laws, which are tougher on bigger than smaller firms, have inhibited and distorted the industry's development.</p><p>As the report puts it, manufacturing firms have little incentive to employ and grow, since by staying small they can avoid taxes and complex labour regulations.</p><p>A second part of the explanation the report points to is what it calls \"structural bottlenecks\". As with all developing countries, the whole Indian economy suffers under inadequate economic and social infrastructure.</p><p>But manufacturing is particularly reliant on good transport links - more so than the tech sector - and India's transport infrastructure is still bad.</p><p>Every business needs a reliable electricity supply, but manufacturing probably needs it more than most. A business survey has found that 48 per cent of manufacturing firms experience power cuts for more than five hours a week. About 60 per cent of firms feel that erratic power supply affects their competitiveness and they would be willing to pay more for a more reliable supply.</p><p>As usual with developing economies, the list of things that need reform is  long.

We've been watching our neighbours do the trick for years. It's called export-oriented growth and it's all about building a big manufacturing sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You encourage under-employed rural workers to move to the city and take jobs in factories. Because your one big economic advantage is an abundant supply of cheap labour, you start by concentrating on making low-cost, simple, labour-intensive items such as textiles, clothing and footwear. Since the locals don't have much capacity to buy this stuff, you focus on exporting it. Foreigners lap it up because to them it's so cheap.</p><p>As the plan works and the country's income rises, you plough a fair bit back into raising the education level of your workers, which allows you to move to making more elaborate goods and to paying higher wages. You're on the way to being a developed country.</p><p>Over the decades we've seen a succession of countries climb this ladder: Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, China and now even Vietnam and Bangladesh at the bottom. It's like pass-the-parcel: as each country's labour gets too expensive to be used to produce low-value thongs and T-shirts, some poorer country takes over and starts the climb to prosperity.</p><p>That's the way it's always done. Except for one country: India. Its economy started growing strongly in the 1990s and now it's the world's third-biggest (provided you measure it correctly, allowing for differences in purchasing power).</p><p>India has got this far without building a big, export-oriented manufacturing sector. It's done something that's probably unique: skipped the manufacturing stage and gone straight to the rich-country stage, in which most growth in jobs and production comes from services.</p><p>The Indians have done it by being so good with software and other information and communications technology and the things that hang off it, such as call centres. It's a big export earner.</p><p>It's an impressive effort, and there's no reason a developing country shouldn't have a big tech sector. But, even so, the experts are saying India would be a lot better off if it had a bigger, more vibrant manufacturing sector, employing a lot more people who, by Indian standards, would be on good wages. This is a key theme in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's report on the Indian economy, issued this week.</p><p>The report offers suggestions on what could be done to encourage the growth of manufacturing, which go a fair way towards explaining why manufacturing never really got going the way it did in other ''emerging market economies''.</p><p>First, some basic facts. India has a population of 1250 million and before long it will overtake China's. About 29 per cent of the population is younger than 15.</p><p>Manufacturing accounts for only 13 per cent of India's gross domestic product, which is low compared with the other BRIICS emerging economies Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and China, but not South Africa.</p><p>Indian manufacturing probably accounts for a slightly smaller share of its total employment. Huh? It's normally the other way round. You'd expect it to be quite labour intensive. But despite abundant, low-skilled and relatively cheap labour, Indian manufacturing is surprisingly capital and skill intensive, the report says.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of manufacturing employment is in companies with fewer than 10 employees. That compares with Brazil's 9 per cent. This tells us the sector's many small firms mean it isn't exploiting its potential economies of scale.</p><p>And, indeed, its manufacturing productivity is low, with productivity 1.6 times higher in China and and 2.9 times in Brazil.</p><p>India's employment in manufacturing hasn't grown much over the years, with the sector hardest hit by the economy's recent slowdown. What new jobs have been created have been ''informal'', with workers not covered by social security arrangements.</p><p>Manufacturing's share of India's ''merchandise'' or goods exports (that is, ignoring the big and rapidly growing exports of IT services) fell from 77 per cent to 65 per cent over the decade to 2013.</p><p>My guess is an important reason for the sector's unusual configuration and weak growth is excessive regulation. India has been and still is a highly, and badly, regulated economy. The socialists' obsession with manufacturing means I wouldn't be surprised if the newer technology sector has taken over the running because, being outside the Left's traditional preoccupations, it wasn't so heavily regulated.</p><p>Some regulation has been removed but, particularly as they apply to manufacturing, India's labour and tax laws, which are tougher on bigger than smaller firms, have inhibited and distorted the industry's development.</p><p>As the report puts it, manufacturing firms have little incentive to employ and grow, since by staying small they can avoid taxes and complex labour regulations.</p><p>A second part of the explanation the report points to is what it calls ''structural bottlenecks''. As with all developing countries, the whole Indian economy suffers under inadequate economic and social infrastructure.</p><p>But manufacturing is particularly reliant on good transport links - more so than the tech sector - and India's transport infrastructure is still bad.</p><p>Every business needs a reliable electricity supply, but manufacturing probably needs it more than most. A business survey has found that 48 per cent of manufacturing firms experience power cuts for more than five hours a week. About 60 per cent of firms feel that erratic power supply affects their competitiveness and they would be willing to pay more for a more reliable supply.</p><p>As usual with developing economies, the list of things that need reform is long. The challenge for governments is to give priority to the ones that would do most to help, even though everything is interconnected.</p><p>In the case of Indian manufacturing, however, the OECD's top recommendation is to introduce simpler and more flexible labour law, which doesn't discriminate by the size of the enterprise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CARTOON: GLEN LELIEVRE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-6i0aekkw8pswlde8k7a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DN6-1201-JD34-V3S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 22, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Industry/Manufacturing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Economics Economists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Trade/Exports and Imports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Standards of living</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Profile</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The venue was a hotel in Mumbai, a five-star fortress of foyers and finger food. The guests of honour were politicians. Grey-haired, well-fed executives sat and talked in jargon. It was hard to spot anyone close to India's median age of 26. Things have come a long way since 1981 when Infosys, a bellwether Indian IT firm, was founded in a flat by seven hungry engineers with $250.</p><p>Yet if you walk to the exit of that hotel and reject the option of an expensive limousine, or of hailing a bashed-up street taxi, and instead press \"Book now\" on your phone screen, another Indian tech scene appears. The application links a network of taxis using satellite positioning, cheap Chinese-made smartphones, souped-up Google maps and credit cards. A 6km (4-mile) drive north in a modern car will deliver you to a snack shop, above which is the firm that runs the system. Olacabs was set up in 2010. Its co-founder, Bhavish Aggarwal, is a 26-year-old engineer who has worked for Microsoft in Seattle. He has raised a slug of venture capital, some of it American, and says business is growing at 30% a month. \"When you start you are viewed as a fool,\" he says. \"But if you are worried about that, you're in the wrong line of work.\" His goal is to transform transport in India's congested cities.</p><p>India needs a million Olacabs: start-ups that use technology to overcome everyday problems. The economic benefits would be huge. And in a country with a stuffy business culture, in which commercial and political dynasties are all too common, a technology revolution would be a colossal breath of fresh air. It would help unleash the energy of a generation of young people. But will it happen?</p><p>India has already had one technology revolution. In the 1980s middle-class engineers from a dirt-poor socialist India somehow persuaded Western firms to outsource their back-office functions and bits of their IT operations to the subcontinent. Thus began a three-decade-long boom.</p><p>The revolution fed its children well. Thanks to IT, some 3m Indians now work in well-paid formal jobs of the kind that India needs so badly. Perhaps another 10m knock-on jobs have been created for maids, drivers and the like. Technology services have saved India from bankruptcy--exports were 4% of GDP in 2012, keeping the balance of payments in passable shape. As well as local champions such as Infosys, TCS and Wipro, 750 multinational firms have outsourcing and technology hubs in India. Many perform research and development. The cultural impact of all this has been huge. The best-selling novels of Chetan Bhagat, such as \"One night @ the call center\", record the angst and romances of India's young workers.</p><p>Yet all is not peachy. The IT-services industry is maturing. Other countries are building rival call centres. (Americans find Filipino accents easier to understand.) The gap between Indian and Western technology workers' wages is shrinking, although it will probably not vanish for a decade or more. Rich countries are putting up barriers to stop jobs moving overseas.</p><p>And another thing worries Indian geeks. Their country has so many advantages: the English language, engineers with global experience, a conspicuously successful diaspora in Silicon Valley. Why, then, has it failed to produce a new generation of big tech firms? In contrast to America's constant regeneration, India's champions have spare tyres and grey hair.</p><h>False dawns, elusive profits</h><p>Indian IT has seen several false starts. Between 1998 and 2002 a crowd of dotcom start-ups were born. Most died. In 2006-08 India had a mini-boom in mobile \"value-added-services\" such as ringtones and text-based products. That, too, fizzled out. In 2010-11 venture capitalists lavished cash on weak e-commerce firms, inflating a bubble. About 70% of the 50-odd firms that got funding are now dead or on life support, reckons Allegro, an investment bank in Bangalore.</p><p>The gulf between Indian hype and reality over the past decade is best shown in numbers. One veteran venture capitalist reckons the investments made in \"new-generation\" (ie, excluding IT services) technology firms are worth $5 billion-6 billion today. The largest listed firm has a market capitalisation of $700m. By way of comparison, China's listed internet firms have a combined value of over $100 billion and its e-commerce sales are about 18 times India's. Other emerging economies, such as Russia, Argentina and South Africa, have produced multi-billion-dollar internet champions. During the past decade India has fallen behind.</p><p>Fortunately things are changing. First, the internet is becoming popular. Penetration is just 3-4% of the population, if judged by the number of moderately fast fixed internet lines and smartphones that use 2.5G and 3G services. About two-thirds of these connections are mobile. If you include people who access the web through caf\u00e9s, at work, on friends' computers or through basic phones with small screens, penetration is 10%. Most surfers are young. Many live in provincial towns that the IT revolution has hitherto bypassed.</p><p>That 10% is a big figure in absolute terms--122m people--and it will rise as smartphones get cheaper. (The fixed-line network, largely in state hands, will probably remain hopeless.) Some applications are already popular. Almost half of all reserved train tickets are bought online, saving hundreds of millions of man-hours spent queuing at stations.</p><p>The second change for the better is that the start-up scene now has depth, partly as a result of all those mini-booms and busts. The venture-capital industry, with a mix of local and American firms, is now well developed and capable of writing big cheques. And a new generation of entrepreneurs has emerged, most of whom combine technical skills with global experience. Of the 15 technology-firm founders interviewed by The Economist for this article, 12 have worked in America or for multinationals in India. Unlike the older generation, these tigers do not fear failure. Many boast of their early misadventures, much as Silicon Valley types do.</p><h>My phone is my temple</h><p>Deep Kalra, the founder of Makemytrip, a travel site, previously worked at ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank, and General Electric. He also spent time setting up bowling alleys in India, without much success, and managed to survive the dotcom bust in 2002. Prashant Tandon of Healthkart, an online health store, studied at Stanford University and worked in San Francisco for McKinsey, a consultancy, before returning home. He and his partner's first venture, a network linking doctors and patients, failed. Their second looks healthier.</p><p>What kind of companies are these new entrepreneurs creating? Sandeep Singhal of Nexus, a venture-capital firm, describes India's new tech scene as a mixture of Israel and China. The \"Israeli\" bit involves selling clever innovations to foreigners. It is still fairly small. InMobi, which sells technology and services for advertising on the mobile internet, is unusual in that it broke into other emerging markets, such as Indonesia and South Africa, before cracking America. \"A lot of firms struggle to innovate because the [Indian] market is too small,\" says its founder, Naveen Tewari. They need to look farther afield, adds Mr Tewari, a Harvard and McKinsey alumnus who has become something of a hero for budding entrepreneurs.</p><p>Only a brave few follow this advice. Cloudbyte, for example, makes storage software for use in data centres. It has just moved one of its co-founders to America. \"The market is largely in the US. We want to be a global company with our engineering talent in India,\" says the co-founder still in India, Srivibhavan Balaram. Another firm, Magzter, puts magazine content onto phones. It began with Indian magazines read by the diaspora but now has hundreds of non-Indian titles on board and customers everywhere. Its app has been downloaded 600m times. Its co-founder, Girish Ramdas, holds the under-21 Indian record for 0.22 rifle shooting. He previously ran a poultry farm, then a website about his home city of Chennai, then a film magazine. He spends a lot of time abroad signing up more publishers.</p><p>The \"Chinese\" part of the industry is much bigger. The label refers to local firms that sell to locals, as China's internet giants do. Such firms account for about three-quarters of activity by next-generation Indian tech firms (see table). Some sniff that Indian e-commerce firms are mere copies of Western ones, or that they largely serve the rich. Such gripes miss the mark. The real achievement of India's digital merchants has been to create reliable supply chains and systems in a country where few things work smoothly.</p><p>Flipkart, a leading firm, built its own warehouses and delivery teams. It accepts cash on delivery from customers reluctant to use credit cards. To stock 80% of the books printed in India, it needs to deal with no fewer than 1,000 suppliers, says its co-founder, Sachin Bansal. Even \"marketplace\" sites, which avoid holding inventory, must work hard to make sure suppliers and couriers do what they promise.</p><p>Nor is it true that e-commerce sites cater only to an elite. Kunal Bahl of Snapdeal, an online marketplace, says it gets 60% of its orders from outside the big cities, from people who may have little experience of formal bricks-and-mortar shops (as opposed to informal wood-and-corrugated-iron ones). Bangalore-based Redbus has begun to transform long-distance bus travel by bringing a fragmented market of over 1,000 private coach firms online and centralising ticket sales onto its system. Its 32-year-old boss, Phanindra Sama, the son of a farmer, recalls the early days traipsing round bus depots trying to persuade grizzled operators to sign up. \"It was painful,\" he says. The site spread by word of mouth among young office workers.</p><p>These firms are exciting but still small. All e-commerce sites in India between them had sales of $10 billion in 2012, about four-fifths from travel products such as plane tickets, according to McKinsey. It forecasts that sales will approach $100 billion in the next five years, roughly the same size as the conventional Indian IT industry is today. Most of that growth is expected to come from a surge in the number of people accessing the web on their phones. In this scenario India will bypass the PC era and leapfrog straight to the mobile internet.</p><p>It is at this point that veterans of the telecoms industry chortle. India's 700m mobile subscribers are stingy. Only 5% pay for mobile broadband and only a fifth of those engage in e-commerce, says one network boss. Handsets using Google's Android operating system are available at $100 or less, but their quality is poor. About a fifth of smartphone buyers use them only for voice calls and as a fashion accessory.</p><p>Thrifty customers make profits elusive. Sundar Lakshmanan, an engineer in Bangalore, designed \"Suruk\", a mobile app that checks if your rickshaw driver is ripping you off. It became a media sensation, but he made no money from it. Mr Lakshmanan has now moved away from mobile to set up a travel site called Tripthirsty.</p><p>Yet the mobile internet is spreading. About a quarter of internet traffic in India is now from mobile phones, reckons Rajan Anandan, the head of Google in India. The global figure is 14%, according to StatCounter. E-commerce sites are seeing a shift towards mobile. Flipkart says phones account for 6-7% of sales, most of it from new users. This should reach 20-25% in a year. Hrush Bhatt of Cleartrip, a travel site, reckons 8% of his sales are now from mobile and this will reach 25-30% in a year. \"People underestimate how quickly India will adopt the mobile internet,\" he says.</p><p>Existing e-commerce firms have a head start, but no one knows who will win in the long run. The mobile-network operators, such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, will probably be \"dumb pipes\" without a big role in content, as they are elsewhere. The most downloaded mobile apps by Indians are foreign, such as WhatsApp, a messaging service, and Facebook.</p><p>Yet in time more India-specific apps may emerge. Some 300km south of Goa on India's balmy west coast is the town of Udupi, where Rohith Bhat runs Robosoft Technologies. It is a big developer of mobile apps globally (mainly for the iPhone) and builds sites for third parties as well. Thus far only a small part of Mr Bhat's business is in India, but he expects that to change. \"In 2013 you'll see some success stories. By 2014 it will be huge.\"</p><p>The hope is that as mobile e-commerce booms, it will boost software and hardware start-ups. Vani Kola, a venture capitalist, says that \"India will never build the next Oracle. We don't have pure science innovation--we're not winning Nobel prizes. But India will develop technologies that could take off around the world, from cheap internet-access systems to payments processes.\" If that happens, the boom would change India and create a new generation of exporters.</p><p>To lead a mobile-internet revolution, India's entrepreneurs must overcome three problems. The first is payments systems. Only about a fifth of Indians have debit or credit cards and those who do are scared of using them online. When they try the process is clunky--a quarter of attempts to pay on the Indian Railways site, probably India's most frequently used, fail. The good news is that regulators are easing the rules for small transactions. Anish Williams quit HSBC to co-found Transerv, a firm that has just launched a pre-paid mobile wallet that can be bought from street vendors and downloaded onto phones. It piggybacks on the credit-card payments system and should make buying online easier. Firms like this could make a big difference.</p><p>The second bottleneck is capital. India's e-commerce industry will need billions of dollars to grow. But local venture-capital firms struggle to write cheques of over $100m. Some fear that foreign investment in e-commerce may fall under the same rules as apply to bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart. These let individual states ban activity.</p><p>The third impediment is India's telecoms sector. Once celebrated, it is indebted, loss-making and fragmented. To blame are a price war, graft and licensing rules that prevent consolidation and roaming. The industry is cutting investment in networks at exactly the wrong time. There are multiple different spectrum and licence charges; big operators pay up to a third of their sales on such levies and on taxes. Telecoms firms are so fed up they refuse to participate in new spectrum auctions.</p><p>One potential saviour is India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who owns a licence for 4G services and whose secretive firm, Reliance Industries, has the firepower to invest $10 billion. Rival executives think his project is stalling--the spectrum he has is at an unattractive frequency, they think, that requires too many base stations to work well, and will struggle to be compatible with global handset standards. Even if they are wrong, it would be uncomfortable if India's mobile-internet boom relied on a single politically connected tycoon. What India really needs is a complete clean-out of its rotten telecoms bureaucracy. That would help investment to recover.</p><h>The competence trick</h><p>Ministers now bask in its reflected glory, but India's outsourcing revolution happened despite the government. All the best firms needed was a little deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Once politicians stopped restricting access to global bandwidth and imported computers and cut taxes, these firms were set free. Even today they are unusually self-reliant, educating their own staff and running their own backup power plants.</p><p>A mobile-internet boom, by contrast, will need a more competent state: one that unshackles payments systems, regulates telecoms sensibly and does not throttle everything with red tape. India has all the other ingredients it needs: entrepreneurs brimming with ideas and customers hungry for change. With the right framework, they could bring about a second technology revolution that dwarfs the first.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201303160009\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201303160010\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20130316t1620000018xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FJJ-JT21-DYWT-T04T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2726\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2013 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

It has literally transformed the country, allowing everyone to communicate, gain knowledge, transact commerce, summon a taxi, order food, and stream Bollywood songs. Imagine how much more painful the Covid-19 pandemic would have been without the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same technologies that have done a lot of good, however, also imperil India's freedoms. They have widened the global equity gap, created echo chambers of disinformation and empowered a small group of foreign companies. It is isn't one East India Company that is looking to colonize India, but several. And they come from both the East and the West.</p><p>The reality now is that technology is taking over every part of our lives; every part of society; every waking moment of every day. Once, technology could be put in a box, a discrete business dominated by business systems and some cool gadgets. Thanks to the internet, it has slowly but surely crept into more corners of our lives. In everything from biology to energy to media to politics to food to transportation, unprecedented change is redefining our future.</p><p>What are we heading for? From the East, you see an aggressive Chinese government, shedding its sheep's clothing, styling itself as a Wolf Warrior. It has become so deeply entrenched in industries such as technology, communications, social media, medicine, and high-value manufacturing that it could literally control the world. It has been perfecting the capabilities of spying on every person on the planet by spying on its own people, and seeks to influence global public opinion through social media and monopolize almost every supply chain by controlling digital infrastructure.</p><p>Now look to the West, where US policy makers from both sides of politics have been grilling the CEOs of some of the largest technology companies, trying to have them take responsibility for the global carnage their products have caused. Yet both the ruling and opposition parties are helpless in controlling these companies' influence and power. The hearings served to document the abuses they had committed, but not to correct them.</p><p>Then there are widening income inequality and a growing technological divide. As the present pandemic decimates global economies, hundreds of millions of people lose their jobs, and hundred of thousands succumb to coronavirus disease, the market valuations of these companies are reaching all-time highs, their owners becoming wealthier by the day. In the US and Europe, more and more people, paying the price but largely excluded from the benefits of technological progress, are protesting however they can. And technologies such as social media are being used to fan the flames and to exploit ignorance and bias.</p><p>As I had discussed in The Driver in the Driverless Car, a book that warned about the dark sides of technologies, the situation will get only worse - unless we find ways to share the prosperity we are creating and chart higher standards for its use. For India, the future could also hold a modern form of colonialism, with foreign companies dominating its industries and taking all the spoils.</p><p>The problem is that the same technologies that bring us together also monitor everything we do.</p><p>Through our smartphones and their applications, Apple, Google, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Facebook track our movements and habits. They know who we speak to. They know what we say. They read our texts and e-mails. And our web searches and the videos we watch tell them our thoughts and preferences. When we post our photos on social media, they store them, recognise our faces and our friends', and use them to learn who we know and where we were and are.</p><p>These companies use all these data to sell ads to us. That is how they make their billions. The problem, as we saw with the US Congressional hearings on Big Tech, is that they lack scruples and the guidance of the most basic ethics. They will allow a person or a government to serve misinformation and propaganda to anyone who fits specified criteria. And this gives them more power than governments have.</p><p>Chinese companies carry the greater risks of the Communist Party's ambition of making the rest of the world subservient to China as it has succeeded in doing to neighbouring states and even imposing force as it has done in Hong Kong. That ambition rests on technological reach. Phone applications such as TikTok and the software on Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, and other Chinese phones are probably not doing much damage just yet; but they have that potential. Almost any technology that connects to the internet can get a software update that turns it into spyware and worse. China's National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires every company and citizen to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". So the Chinese government can induct these companies whenever it wishes to.</p><p>Mastery over our lives is not the role that we envisaged for these technologies. And it's not the future that India wants to build for itself.</p><p>That is why India's prime focus for Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) should be the technologies it chooses to base its digital infrastructure on. India needn't build the semiconductors or mine the rare minerals for electronic components; rather, it can focus on the layers of technology built on top of these, both the assembled hardware and apps.</p><p>India also needs laws that are more stringent than Europe's Data Protection Regulation. Yes, it needs to prevent the export of data; more fundamentally, it must ensure that all Indian residents' data remain their own, for use only with their explicit permission. This will entail dramatically strengthening India's privacy laws, to limit any company's ability to spy on its users.</p><p>India doesn't have to lose this battle to the modern-day East India companies from the East or West. It has the talent to build its own infrastructure and to leap ahead. Its millions of engineers, trained to develop IT systems for the West, give it a huge advantage. It could be creating world-changing technology companies that challenge Silicon Valley as well as China. Let it do so.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Pune.

It has literally transformed the country, allowing everyone to communicate, gain knowledge, transact commerce, summon a taxi, order food, and stream Bollywood songs. Imagine how much more painful the Covid-19 pandemic would have been without the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same technologies that have done a lot of good, however, also imperil India's freedoms. They have widened the global equity gap, created echo chambers of disinformation and empowered a small group of foreign companies. It is isn't one East India Company that is looking to colonize India, but several. And they come from both the East and the West.</p><p>The reality now is that technology is taking over every part of our lives; every part of society; every waking moment of every day. Once, technology could be put in a box, a discrete business dominated by business systems and some cool gadgets. Thanks to the internet, it has slowly but surely crept into more corners of our lives. In everything from biology to energy to media to politics to food to transportation, unprecedented change is redefining our future.</p><p>What are we heading for? From the East, you see an aggressive Chinese government, shedding its sheep's clothing, styling itself as a Wolf Warrior. It has become so deeply entrenched in industries such as technology, communications, social media, medicine, and high-value manufacturing that it could literally control the world. It has been perfecting the capabilities of spying on every person on the planet by spying on its own people, and seeks to influence global public opinion through social media and monopolize almost every supply chain by controlling digital infrastructure.</p><p>Now look to the West, where US policy makers from both sides of politics have been grilling the CEOs of some of the largest technology companies, trying to have them take responsibility for the global carnage their products have caused. Yet both the ruling and opposition parties are helpless in controlling these companies' influence and power. The hearings served to document the abuses they had committed, but not to correct them.</p><p>Then there are widening income inequality and a growing technological divide. As the present pandemic decimates global economies, hundreds of millions of people lose their jobs, and hundred of thousands succumb to coronavirus disease, the market valuations of these companies are reaching all-time highs, their owners becoming wealthier by the day. In the US and Europe, more and more people, paying the price but largely excluded from the benefits of technological progress, are protesting however they can. And technologies such as social media are being used to fan the flames and to exploit ignorance and bias.</p><p>As I had discussed in The Driver in the Driverless Car, a book that warned about the dark sides of technologies, the situation will get only worse - unless we find ways to share the prosperity we are creating and chart higher standards for its use. For India, the future could also hold a modern form of colonialism, with foreign companies dominating its industries and taking all the spoils.</p><p>The problem is that the same technologies that bring us together also monitor everything we do.</p><p>Through our smartphones and their applications, Apple, Google, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Facebook track our movements and habits. They know who we speak to. They know what we say. They read our texts and e-mails. And our web searches and the videos we watch tell them our thoughts and preferences. When we post our photos on social media, they store them, recognise our faces and our friends', and use them to learn who we know and where we were and are.</p><p>These companies use all these data to sell ads to us. That is how they make their billions. The problem, as we saw with the US Congressional hearings on Big Tech, is that they lack scruples and the guidance of the most basic ethics. They will allow a person or a government to serve misinformation and propaganda to anyone who fits specified criteria. And this gives them more power than governments have.</p><p>Chinese companies carry the greater risks of the Communist Party's ambition of making the rest of the world subservient to China as it has succeeded in doing to neighbouring states and even imposing force as it has done in Hong Kong. That ambition rests on technological reach. Phone applications such as TikTok and the software on Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, and other Chinese phones are probably not doing much damage just yet; but they have that potential. Almost any technology that connects to the internet can get a software update that turns it into spyware and worse. China's National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires every company and citizen to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". So the Chinese government can induct these companies whenever it wishes to.</p><p>Mastery over our lives is not the role that we envisaged for these technologies. And it's not the future that India wants to build for itself.</p><p>That is why India's prime focus for Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) should be the technologies it chooses to base its digital infrastructure on. India needn't build the semiconductors or mine the rare minerals for electronic components; rather, it can focus on the layers of technology built on top of these, both the assembled hardware and apps.</p><p>India also needs laws that are more stringent than Europe's Data Protection Regulation. Yes, it needs to prevent the export of data; more fundamentally, it must ensure that all Indian residents' data remain their own, for use only with their explicit permission. This will entail dramatically strengthening India's privacy laws, to limit any company's ability to spy on its users.</p><p>India doesn't have to lose this battle to the modern-day East India companies from the East or West. It has the talent to build its own infrastructure and to leap ahead. Its millions of engineers, trained to develop IT systems for the West, give it a huge advantage. It could be creating world-changing technology companies that challenge Silicon Valley as well as China. Let it do so.</p><p>Vivek Wadhwa is distinguished fellow, Labour and Worklife Program, Harvard Law School, US, and co-author of the forthcoming book, From Incremental to Exponential: How Large Companies Can See the Future and Rethink Innovation.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

A typical response goes like this - what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though - this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. </p><p>Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1 are perfect examples of bad policy making.Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way - our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.

Global technology players like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Intel, HP, IBM and others choose either Israel or India as their most preferred R&amp;D locations. It is often said that India's Bengaluru and Israel's Tel Aviv are challenging Silicon Valley, while the Silicon Valley itself is dominated by the Indian and Israeli minds. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once referred in his speech that \"in Silicon Valley, there are two dialects you hear - Hindi and Hebrew, and only a little English.\"</p><p>Now the question before both countries is whether our young energy should make challenging Silicon Valley or replicating their culture a key goal? That's too narrow for a goal and too limited for the scope of competition. Our young minds should leverage the technology for providing solutions to those global problems that are not yet addressed, create those examples that are not yet anticipated and should try to build a culture where technology and innovation contribute to the Nation Building and global growth. The youth of countries like India and Israel have a lot to offer to the world, which they can do by becoming more relevant in the future world order, not rebel. But it appears that the new generations of technology and social media tools (produced by big tech companies) are dedicated more on stimulating the 'rebel' part in the youth than creativity - an idea with which they made their products popular.</p><p>This shift in the purpose of the technology industry from 'problem solver' to 'problem creator' to 'problem accelerator\" (in some scenarios) has made the idea of \"human creativity\" an irrelevant subject. Shaping the narratives, supporting the protests, impacting the elections and enabling the non-state actors to achieve their goals   these were not the ideas with which the Internet and digital technologies made their way into the common people's life but today almost all energy and resources of some major tech companies are dedicated to catering to these activities or to the management of the issues which these activities produce.</p><p>Instead of providing the vehicles of effective governance, these social and digital tools are now becoming the new means of distorting the social consensus and creating unnecessary chaos on each and every move of the democratically elected governments. One such experiment of these tech products was recently seen in India, where on the issue of some amendments in the Citizenship Act, hundreds of people from a religious community (organized via social media apps) put the lives and properties of the common people in danger.</p><p>From the \"United States v. Microsoft Corporation\" case of 2001 to Android anti-trust case of 2018, issues of regulation, anti-trust breach and monopolistic approach in technology industry always makes the headlines. And these days the discussion around social media's terrorism support problems is also common but one of the least discussed yet crucial aspects is the gross impact of these technologies cum media and entertainment products on the psychological and social behavior of its users.</p><p>When the consumers became 'prosumers' it was seen as another improvisation of technology business but none had anticipated that the whole concept of the consumer will soon get evaporated from the business model of the tech companies. Technology giants like Google and Facebook deal with more than two billion users monthly and their revenues are growing exponentially, too, but they are following a flawed advertising-based business model which allows them to stay free yet profitable. Approximately 95% of Google's revenue and 98% of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising. The word 'advertising' sounds natural with the business, but those who belong to the technology sector can realize what the scale of information exploitation could be when one billion users voluntarily allow themselves to become the product of some unknown entities.</p><p>From the business perspective too, these major tech companies have obstructed the very basic need of the customer - the freedom of choice and the availability of options to choose from. When a user will have some options to select from, the psychological effect of these apps will automatically get minimized as after that the user will take the product as the product, not as some final universal truth. When a user will have different versions of Google, each representing different perspectives, then it will naturally make him use his own wisdom and developing his own perspective. If different versions of Twitter will exist in the digital market, the psychological effect of making \"followers\" and participating in the blind race for that will get minimized, as then it will sound more like a common product feature, not a special social status. And if different Facebook kind of apps (equally impressive) will be there, the strong appetite for getting Likes would naturally disappear from the user's mind.</p><p>Today, it seems that the technology is driving the people and making them lose their control, one can say that we are using the smart technologies but becoming dumb as a Human.</p><p>There is a need to recognize that AI, big data, IoT, machine learning, cloud data centers, robotics and other technologies can be leveraged for producing some deterministic outcomes but for the real progress of the technology and economy, it is the human creativity and intelligence that are needed and no algorithm can substitute that.</p><p>It is often said \"disrupt, or get disrupted.\" The time for disrupting the tech industry has come. Young Indian and Israeli minds should be encouraged to brainstorm how they can build a better version of Google, an effective Facebook or a less-cluttered Twitter. When the users will be given the freedom to use their wisdom and make choices, the tech companies will get motivated again to work on gaining the trust of the customers and bringing transparency about the use of their data. As John Chambers, ex-CEO Cisco, mentions in his recent blog: \"The currency of today and of the future is three-fold: trust, track record, and relationships.\"</p><p>The writer promotes advanced technologies, the start-up ecosystem and the Indian government's business- and technology-related initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, Smart Cities and Startup India, among others.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JPOST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y50-DCB1-F12G-D1CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10911</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Jerusalem Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Jerusalem Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Approximately 95% of Google's revenue and 98% of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising. The word 'advertising' sounds natural with the business, but those who belong to the technology sector can realize what the scale of information exploitation could be when one billion users voluntarily allow themselves to become the product of some unknown entities.From the business perspective too, these major tech companies have obstructed the very basic need of the customer \u2013 the freedom of choice and the availability of options to choose from. When a user will have some options to select from, the psychological effect of these apps will automatically get minimized as after that the user will take the product as the product, not as some final universal truth. When a user will have different versions of Google, each representing different perspectives, then it will naturally make him use his own wisdom and developing his own perspective. If different versions of Twitter will exist in the digital market, the psychological effect of making \"followers\" and participating in the blind race for that will get minimized, as then it will sound more like a common product feature, not a special social status. And if different Facebook kind of apps (equally impressive) will be there, the strong appetite for getting Likes would naturally disappear from the user's mind.Today, it seems that the technology is driving the people and making them lose their control, one can say that we are using the smart technologies but becoming dumb as a Human.There is a need to recognize that AI, big data, IoT, machine learning, cloud data centers, robotics and other technologies can be leveraged for producing some deterministic outcomes but for the real progress of the technology and economy, it is the human creativity and intelligence that are needed and no algorithm can substitute that.It is often said \"disrupt, or get disrupted.\" The time for disrupting the tech industry has come. Young Indian and Israeli minds should be encouraged to brainstorm how they can build a better version of Google, an effective Facebook or a less-cluttered Twitter. When the users will be given the freedom to use their wisdom and make choices, the tech companies will get motivated again to work on gaining the trust of the customers and bringing transparency about the use of their data. As John Chambers, ex-CEO Cisco, mentions in his recent blog: \"The currency of today and of the future is three-fold: trust, track record, and relationships.\"The writer promotes advanced technologies, the start-up ecosystem and the Indian government's business- and technology-related initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, Smart Cities and Startup India, among others.<br/>All rights reserved  The Jerusalem Post 1995 - 2020  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/46/158033183160.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/46/158033183160.jpeg</url></p><p>PRIME MINISTER of India Narendra Modi looks on during his 2017 visit to Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a document of cooperation.

India is its biggest international market, with at least 120 million monthly active users \u00adreported before the ban.</p><p/><p>But a border clash between China and India that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian troops in mid-June has led to a backlash against Chinese technology.</p><p/><p>In a week after the India ban, the average negative sentiment towards the Chinese-owned app on social media rose to 80 per cent from 55 per cent the week before, according to data provided by \u00adglobal media intelligence \u00adcompany Meltwater.</p><p/><p>It is not just Indian domestic rivals that stand to benefit from the international resistance against TikTok.</p><p/><p>Facebook-owned Instagram, for instance, said yesterday it was testing its TikTok-like new \u00adfeature, Reels, in India.</p><p/><p>\"People across the big and small cities of India come to \u00adInstagram to express themselves safely, and also to be entertained,\" Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit \u00adMohan said in a statement.</p><p/><p>Google-owned video giant YouTube is also reportedly \u00addeveloping a short-form video-sharing feature, Shorts, inside its mobile app by the end of 2020, \u00adaccording to tech news website The Information, citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p/><p>\"Looking at the current \u00adsituation, the ban is not expected to go any time soon,\" said Sanjeev Kumar, an analyst at the New Delhi office of United States-based research firm \u00adForrester.</p><p/><p>TikTok was losing its \"first mover advantage\" and while it was possible that India would eventually lift the ban, the precious months in between could be a \"bonus for all these Western players and Indian apps\", he said.</p><p/><p>Western apps owned by tech giants such as Facebook and Google were \"more than equipped\" to latch onto the disruption, while local apps were mostly seeing a surge in users because of the \u00adrelative shortage of short-form options from established Western players, but they could \"certainly catch up\" in time, Kumar added.</p><p/><p>Given the importance of the India market to TikTok, the ban is set to deal a major blow, possibly leading to as much as US$6 billion in losses for its parent company, ByteDance, according to a report last week by mainland media \u00adoutlet Caixin, which cited anonymous sources.</p><p/><p>It is not just in India that \u00adTikTok is facing challenges. It has already come under fire in a \u00adnumber of countries, particularly the US, over issues relating to data \u00adprivacy and security.</p><p/><p>The Australian defence \u00addepartment has left TikTok out of its list of approved apps for \u00addevices used by its military \u00adpersonnel, \u00adtaking a similar stance to the US Army and the US Navy.</p><p/><p>In light of the new national security law in Hong Kong, TikTok this week went a step further than other social media giants, which have said they would suspend user information requests from Hong Kong authorities, and \u00adannounced it would exit the city entirely within days.</p><p/><p>But it continues to face \u00adregulatory scrutiny worldwide, especially in the US.</p><p/><p>On Tuesday, US Vice- \u00adPresident Mike Pence said the country would \"continue to take a strong stand\" regarding Chinese entities that posed national \u00adsecurity threats.

According to Sensor Tower, TikTok and its Chinese version, Douyin, have been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally by the end of April.</p><p/><p>In June, TikTok and Douyin earned more than US$90.7 \u00admillion in user spending, 8.3 times their revenue in June 2019, \u00adaccording to Sensor Tower, \u00adalthough most of that came from Douyin.</p><p/><p>But Alex Capri, a research \u00adfellow at the \u00adHinrich Foundation, said that with big tech firms being seen as \"wealthy\" and \"powerful\", TikTok would find it hard to avoid being pulled into geopolitical \u00adtensions despite all its efforts to distance itself from China.</p><p/><p>\"The Chinese market is closed to foreign competition.

American firms are betting billions on the Indian market because, unlike China's, it has been relatively open to foreign competitors. That might be about to change.</p><p>\"It is unprecedented and it needs to be taken very seriously,\" said Vinay Kesari, a Bangalore-based technology lawyer specialising in regulatory matters who has worked with US tech firms. \"It could have huge implications.\" A draft of a new e-commerce policy, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, repeatedly calls for a \"level playing field\" and outlines new rules for \"encouraging domestic innovation and boosting the domestic digital economy to find its rightful place with dominant and potentially non-competitive global players\".</p><p>Data created by users in India from e-commerce platforms, social media and search engines would need to be \"stored exclusively in India\", the draft says, adding that the government would have access to it.</p><p>The policy draft also suggests closing some of the loopholes that allow foreign e-commerce companies to skirt restrictions on foreign ownership of retail.</p><p>Indian policymakers and some local start-ups are worried the South Asian nation is missing an opportunity to develop its own world-beating tech titans.</p><p>They see how China's restrictive policies have helped it create some of the world's biggest and most innovative tech brands, including Alibaba and Tencent, and want to give Indian companies more breathing room to grow.</p><p>For US companies, India is a prize worth fighting for. It now has 390 million internet users, more than the US and second only to China, according to a report from consultancy Bain &amp; Co. Its e-commerce market is expected to be worth $US33 billion this year, three times greater than what it was in 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.Amazon is spending $US5bn to boost its operations here. It dominates the e-commerce market along with Flipkart, a homegrown company that Walmart bought for $US16bn earlier this year. A handful of smaller, local online shopping start-ups are vying for the few remaining online shoppers. Amazon and Walmart declined to comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-609faace9f6b11e886209b9dad719bca6e31d5b5f343bf0ab5e49d2a894f6ff3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1M-TGW1-JD3N-52RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 15, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00028PO</classCode><className>BAIN &amp;

The industry does not trust projects in which they have to invest because non-recovery of investment in government projects is still an issue. Other than GST, which has a streamlined payment mechanism, few other projects are seeing active participation,\" said an industry source.</p><p>Indian IT companies have said that over '. 5,000 crore of payments are stuck with the government.While delayed payments have been a long standing issue that prevents Indian IT companies from bidding for government projects, the lack of clarity and changes in requirements in the middle of an ongoing project have also held them back.</p><p>\"The interest in the industry on bidding for projects where there is back-ended payment is low,\" said Neel Ratan, leader government and public sector at consultancy PwC India.</p><p>Last month, Infosys chairman Narayana Murthy said there was not a single government project the company had undertaken where it had not lost money . The firm is among the five bidders of the GST project, along with TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and Microsoft.</p><p>Anant Gupta, chief executive of <person><nameText>HCL </nameText></person>Technologies, told ET earlier this month that payment terms of government projects were \"as</p><p>challenging as they were\", but it was unfair to expect a major overhaul given the regulatory requirements of transparency that government projects come with.</p><p>\"Government projects are now becoming very large, so one company cannot bid, and they (companies) want to take part in a consortium model. But in this model, if one party runs out of energy , cash or resources...everybody suffers because government will not pay unless everything is over,\" said an IT consultant who did not wish to be named.</p><p>Recently , the finance ministry put out a nearly '. 150-crore tender for building a system called Project Insight, which will help catch tax evaders, using technologies such as enterprise data warehouse, data mining, web mining, predictive modelling, data exchange, master data management, centralised processing, compliance management and case analytics capabilities.</p><p>The project has not found many takers because payment will be made on a transactional basis over</p><p>a period of five years. \"A lot of contracts are also becoming managed services contracts, which mean you don't just have to build the system but you also have to operate them.Therefore, the cycles are even longer,\" said the IT consultant quoted above.</p><p>The lack of interested bidders could also be leading to oversight about the credentials of interested companies.</p><p>For example, one of the companies shortlisted for providing the analytics platform for the government's crowdsourcing platform MyGov is Zylog Systems, which has a courtappointed liquidator since November last year. Other bidders include IBM, HP, PC Solutions and SAS Institute India.</p><p>Microsoft India chairman Bhaskar Pramanik agreed that the government's payment terms were \"a little lopsided\".</p><p>While the formal policy of the Government of India covers most of contentious issues about the ability to make payments appropriately, they are not always followed in practice, he added.</p><p>However, not all companies necessarily see a reduced interest in government contracts.</p><p>\"The opportunities in Digital India are exciting. We have been cautious on government projects. You can't generalise and say people won't participate because different companies will have different risk appetites,\" said Aruna Jayanthi, chief executive of Capgemini India.</p><p>ET VIEW</p><p>Don't Let Down Software Biggies</p><p>The government should not let down India's IT industry, globally recognised for best practices in technology, processes and project execution. Prime Minister Modi has promised a transformational approach to national development through Digital India over the next four years. But unless the screening and procurement processes are streamlined, transparency and efficiency brought in, viability ensured through clarity on project requirements and timely payments, our IT industry may stay off. NR Narayana Murthy has offered sage advice to enthuse participation in Digital India. Modi must listen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_83_11082015007022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GN6-K8S1-JB3N-T1B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

UK based security solutions provider Topsgrup is looking at securing India's upcoming smart cities. The company has been operating some key projects like the Quick Response Time in Mumbai, and is keen to tap into the huge digital and mobile based security opportunity that India is likely to offer in the near future. We talked to their CEO Ramesh Iyer, who told ET that security is still mostly an afterthought in India. And we need stronger policy frameworks for security if we want to move towards threat-proof smart cities. Excerpts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How is Topsgrup planning to tap the security opportunity in the smart cities space in India?</p><p>Due to India's rapid rate of urbanisation and with kind of population density Indian cities are managing, there is an ever increasing necessity for private sector security companies to play their part in working alongside both state governments and central government to develop, deploy and manage a comprehensive and fully integrated security system.</p><p>Topsgrup and the Indian government work closely to provide the nation with the necessary guidelines to establish fully-functional smart cities, which will not only provide infrastructural services to its citizens, but, very crucially, will also focus on providing comprehensive security, ensuring every city is kept safe and secure. I believe that in order to tap the security opportunity in India, there needs to be more public-private partnerships between state institutions, like the police and government bodies, and private security companies. This kind of synergy will be able to fill any gaps in security service provision.</p><p>What is the growth you are looking at from India?</p><p>The budgets for securing smart cities are yet to be factored by the government. Thus, when the data is disclosed, Topsgrup will be able to accurately pinpoint what type of growth trajectory it is looking at. Topsgrup is in the process of planning several acquisitions of key security brands, which we will soon announce. Topsgrup will attain Rs. 1200 crore revenue in FY 15 with an EBITDA of Rs. 120 crore and we are expecting to have EBITDA of Rs. 190 crore with revenue of Rs. 2000 crore during FY 16.</p><p>Technology led solutions, such as Kay holding mechanism, centralised alarm monitoring systems and security solutions using new age platforms like mobile app are likely to fuel our growth. We have already started working on these projects and currently some of these are in the testing phase.</p><p>What are some of the key projects you are doing in India?</p><p>One of our projects which we are particularly proud of is the TOPSLINE 1252 initiative, which is Mumbai's first and fastest Emergency Response Service (Quick Response Time) with guaranteed response time of 9 minutes. However, for the last 11 years, Topsline's average response time is 6.45 minutes. The service is modelled on US 911 service. Our staff was the first and only people, other than the police, who were allowed at the scene of the Mumbai Terrorist attacks in 2008. Our team played a key role in helping victims of the attacks at the Taj Hotel and the Oberoi Hotel.</p><p>\\xA0</p><p>Outside Mumbai, Tops' Quick Response Time (QRT) has already been launched in the city of Bangalore with one of our big tech clients. The vehicles here are fitted with tracking devices that can be monitored from the control centre. Tracking includes time track, route deviation, vehicle response confirmation. Other features in the QRT vehicles provided are first-aid kit, fire extinguisher, flashlights, and portable mini air compressors with tubeless tyre puncture repair kits. We are also in the process of launching QRT in cities like Ahmedabad, Pune, Delhi, NCR, Gurgaon, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad. We are in talks to implement Geographical Information Systems for certain cities in northern Indiaand to play our bit in National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) program.</p><p>Coming to policy- what do you think needs to change in India? What are some regulations we need put in place to secure cities of the future?</p><p>There needs to be a focus on more integrated, comprehensive and efficient security initiatives to safeguard vital infrastructure, such as airports, railways, highways, hotels, malls. More centralised and digitised operational security monitoring centres would also be a way forward. Security systems must be standardised and made to work in tandem with local police operational systems.</p><p>While everyone talks about smart transportation, smart IT/communications, health, education, no one really cares about security, without which all the other facilities are incomplete. What a smart city really needs is firstly a security solution - general public security, electronic, facility management, training etc. The security aspect of a smart city needs to be prioritized. Other countries that are in the race to achieve smarter cities have established priority programmes for security- prime examples being cities in US and the UK. Like the UK and US, the Indian government should dictate a \"minimum security requirement\" program under which every household and establishment needs to follow standard security measures followed by a regulatory body authorizing and certifying the property or site before possession.</p><p>What are the investment and capital raising plans for the company?</p><p>We are in process of raising $100 million from private equity to fund acquisitions and exit to the present investors. The new acquisition is of market leader in Southern India and with that Tops will become the number one security company in South India in terms of market share.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-47870820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GB4-KTT1-JB3N-T1K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Brand recall for companies like ours is improving every year, we are slowly getting there,\" he said.</p><p>US talent pool much smaller</p><p>\"There is no big cost difference because we have to pay American salaries even to our Indian employees going there,\" he added.</p><p>However, unlike India, which produces nearly 600,000 engineering graduates every year, the US pool is much smaller, ensuring a much more intense fight for whatever talent is available.</p><p>\"Though IT is a popular choice, compared to Indian colleges, the pool of students looking out for a career in IT is smaller and all tech firms are tapping into this pool; so definitely, the war for talent is there,\" said Priti Rajora , global head, talent acquisition, Wipro Technologies .</p><p>On their part, India's top outsourcing companies TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL have already started setting up development centres in locations such as Atlanta and Michigan. While TCS aims to double its foreign workforce from 10,000 currently to 20,000 over the next five years, Infosysand Wipro could see non-Indians account for 10-15% of their total employee base in next 3-5 years, from around 5% currently.</p><p>Wipro, for instance, wants US locals to account for more than half of its workforce in the country, and hiring from local campuses is a strategic shift to achieve that goal.</p><p>These companies have kicked off several initiatives to build a brand on campuses and attract the best talent. Wipro, for instance, has hired a senior campus relationship manager responsible for keeping the company visible in campuses throughout the year. The company says it has managed to create a buzz in these campuses by showcasing alumni, being a part of campus fairs and being present on multiple other forums.</p><p>\"It is true that Wipro is not as big a brand name in the US as it is in India but we have been able to generate significant interest. IT is a buzzword there too and India and China are being seen as the places to be. We have been doing a lot of work in campuses to showcase ourselves,\" Rajora of Wipro said.</p><p>IT firms pay at least 20-25% more to tech graduates in the US compared to Indian colleges. But they do not see this leading to a big increase in employee costs as they are able to charge higher for onsite employees. At the same time, Indian employees sent on H1B visas also prove to be as expensive as they draw salaries on a par with local US talent.</p><p>\"The view of Indian companies in these campuses has changed a lot over the past few years. In the US, campus connect programmes are much deeper and more developed than in Indian colleges and it would be difficult to enter a good college if you were not known.</p><p>Indian IT companies are now finding a place in these colleges; they are now slowly being seen as alternatives to the big tech firms there like IBM and Accenture ,\" said Thiruvengadam P , leader, human capital advisory services, Deloitte.</p><p>Cognizant has a team of 60 full-time recruiters in the US who are solely responsible for hiring candidates locally, both from campuses and the lateral market. The company views this is a sign of a maturing industry.</p><p>\"Just like the manufacturing supply chain went atomically global, we are seeing the early signs of the services value chain go atomically global.</p><p>While we have done undergraduate recruiting from campuses for specific needs of practices earlier, this is the first time we are aggressively focusing on key universities for our pan organisation needs and we are trying to build deep, long-term relationships,\" Shankar Srinivasan, chief people officer, Cognizant said.</p><p>Local experts such as Morley J Nair, who is based in Philadelphia and advises on immigration, say the rate of visa denials by US consulates is among the reasons for increased campus hiring.</p><p>\"Actually, the trend of hiring graduates from US campuses seems to have picked up momentum last year itself, with increased enforcement of H-1B-related regulations by US consulates abroad, and even by the immigration inspectors at US entry points.</p><p>If you recall, the deportation of Indian H-1B workers from Newark, New Jersey airport, in January 2010 was big news, which sent shockwaves through the H-1B community, both employers and employees,\" says Nair.</p><p>\"So the logical conclusion is that if employers are able to hire candidates from US campuses, the 'hazards' of US consulate interviews and overbearing questioning at US entry points can be avoided, at least in the short term, i.e., until they have to travel overseas again and obtain visas to re-enter the US,\" adds Nair.</p><p>Most of these companies are going to the tier-I tech colleges in universities like Carnegie Mellon , Emory, Stanford, Massachusetts, Connecticut and North Maryland, among others.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOI-7522378</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOI2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:526N-9TC1-DXJR-H0CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Brand recall for companies like ours is improving every year, we are slowly getting there,\" he said.</p><p>US talent pool much smaller</p><p>\"There is no big cost difference because we have to pay American salaries even to our Indian employees going there,\" he added.</p><p>However, unlike India, which produces nearly 600,000 engineering graduates every year, the US pool is much smaller, ensuring a much more intense fight for whatever talent is available.</p><p>\"Though IT is a popular choice, compared to Indian colleges, the pool of students looking out for a career in IT is smaller and all tech firms are tapping into this pool; so definitely, the war for talent is there,\" said Priti Rajora, global head, talent acquisition, Wipro Technologies.</p><p>On their part, India's top outsourcing companies TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL have already started setting up development centres in locations such as Atlanta and Michigan. While TCS aims to double its foreign workforce from 10,000 currently to 20,000 over the next five years, Infosys and Wipro could see non-Indians account for 10-15% of their total employee base in next 3-5 years, from around 5% currently.</p><p>Wipro, for instance, wants US locals to account for more than half of its workforce in the country, and hiring from local campuses is a strategic shift to achieve that goal.</p><p>These companies have kicked off several initiatives to build a brand on campuses and attract the best talent. Wipro, for instance, has hired a senior campus relationship manager responsible for keeping the company visible in campuses throughout the year. The company says it has managed to create a buzz in these campuses by showcasing alumni, being a part of campus fairs and being present on multiple other forums.</p><p>\"It is true that Wipro is not as big a brand name in the US as it is in India but we have been able to generate significant interest. IT is a buzzword there too and India and China are being seen as the places to be. We have been doing a lot of work in campuses to showcase ourselves,\" Rajora of Wipro said.</p><p>IT firms pay at least 20-25% more to tech graduates in the US compared to Indian colleges. But they do not see this leading to a big increase in employee costs as they are able to charge higher for onsite employees. At the same time, Indian employees sent on H1B visas also prove to be as expensive as they draw salaries on a par with local US talent.</p><p>\"The view of Indian companies in these campuses has changed a lot over the past few years. In the US, campus connect programmes are much deeper and more developed than in Indian colleges and it would be difficult to enter a good college if you were not known. Indian IT companies are now finding a place in these colleges; they are now slowly being seen as alternatives to the big tech firms there like IBM and Accenture,\" said Thiruvengadam P, leader, human capital advisory services, Deloitte.</p><p>Cognizant has a team of 60 full-time recruiters in the US who are solely responsible for hiring candidates locally, both from campuses and the lateral market. The company views this is a sign of a maturing industry.</p><p>\"Just like the manufacturing supply chain went atomically global, we are seeing the early signs of the services value chain go atomically global. While we have done undergraduate recruiting from campuses for specific needs of practices earlier, this is the first time we are aggressively focusing on key universities for our pan organisation needs and we are trying to build deep, long-term relationships,\" Shankar Srinivasan, chief people officer, Cognizant said.</p><p>Local experts such as Morley J Nair, who is based in Philadelphia and advises on immigration, say the rate of visa denials by US consulates is among the reasons for increased campus hiring.</p><p>\"Actually, the trend of hiring graduates from US campuses seems to have picked up momentum last year itself, with increased enforcement of H-1B-related regulations by US consulates abroad, and even by the immigration inspectors at US entry points. If you recall, the deportation of Indian H-1B workers from Newark, New Jersey airport, in January 2010 was big news, which sent shockwaves through the H-1B community, both employers and employees,\" says Nair.</p><p>\"So the logical conclusion is that if employers are able to hire candidates from US campuses, the 'hazards' of US consulate interviews and overbearing questioning at US entry points can be avoided, at least in the short term, i.e., until they have to travel overseas again and obtain visas to re-enter the US,\" adds Nair.</p><p>Most of these companies are going to the tier-I tech colleges in universities like Carnegie Mellon, Emory, Stanford, Massachusetts, Connecticut and North Maryland, among others.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-7518791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:526F-BKD1-JB3N-T3NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The Indian minister showed his scrutiny by the public and also spoke more about the Libra project.[1] During the 2019 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, DC - which included a discussion of the Libra project[2] - the Indian minister Sitharaman told reporters[3] from the New Indian Express the following: 'On our side, the Reserve Bank Governor spoke about it during our turn to intervene. </p><p>I got the sense that many countries were cautioning on rushing into this []. Countries will have to show extreme caution much before anything is said or moved on this.' Sitharaman also noted that representatives of other nations had argued against the use of the term 'stable currency' or 'stablecoin' but instead emphasized the token and its links to cryptocurrency. As we previously reported in our Libra latest news[4], the stablecoin has been designated by Facebook as a type of digital asset that is designed to mitigate price volatility. As such, it was initially proposed to be backed by a basket of national fiat currencies such as the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Singapore dollar. The Indian minister also said that while presentations at the annual meetings had conceded the prospective strengths of such virtual currencies, 'everyone without fail spoke about the challenges together with talking about it as a necessary step forward. So everyone was stepping cautiously on it.' Circumspection in regards to Libra has indeed been reverberating among the citizens, cryptocurrency industry figures, governments, regulators as well as central bankers worldwide. Besides the Indian minister, China was also in the cryptocurrency news[5] for ratcheting up its existing plans for a central bank digital currency in a bid to protect against the perceived threat to its monetary sovereignty and legal currency status. As the news then showed, the former governor of the People's Bank of China argued that 'people valuing Libra is inseparable from the global dollarization trend.'

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as she descended an escalator at a convention center to greet a throng of cheering supporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the most memorable entrance of the nearly two dozen Democratic presidential candidates who spoke at a party pep rally here over the weekend - and a sign that Harris, who has struggled to establish a political philosophy to compete with her most prominent rivals, is still seeking to distinguish herself.</p><p>Throughout the weekend, she cast herself as a candidate of action, seeming to embrace the notion that the Harris brand is one built on practicality as much as any sort of sweeping vision.</p><p>\"I think it's important to have grand and broad ideas for how to fix this world,\" Harris told voters at a Friday night meet-and-greet. \"But it's also important, and I believe for me it's a priority, how can I address the things that wake people up in the middle of the night?\"</p><p>Harris' performance, which had the feel of a reboot, reflected the challenge confronting her as she seeks to capitalize on her prime spot this week in the first candidate debates in which she will share center stage Thursday with polling leaders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.</p><p>In a crowded field in which Sanders' Democratic socialism and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's heavily regulated capitalism are elbowing for supremacy on the far left and Biden is positioning himself as a centrist best positioned to beat President Donald Trump, Harris is known more for her prosecutorial performance in Senate hearings than she is for advocating any particular approach to policy.</p><p>\"Everybody has their little niche, and I don't think Kamala has a niche yet,\" said Leslie Stein, an engineer and California transplant to Las Vegas who attended a Harris speech last week in that city and has been following Harris's career from her district attorney days. \"She's saying a lot of what's out there, but she hasn't made anything her own.\"</p><p>Stein's reaction is one offered by many people who attend Harris's campaign events. While many say they see Harris as a trailblazer who represents change, few can articulate exactly what kind of change a Harris administration would yield - particularly in contrast to the well-defined agendas of other contenders.</p><p>\"I know about Elizabeth Warren because that's her thing: plans and ideas. Bernie Sanders I know because he's run before,\" said Shirley Sandoval, a 76-year-old Las Vegas resident. \"And I know Joe Biden because he's been around so long - you just kind of know him, even though he's changed his mind on things. Even big things, like abortion.\"</p><p>\"(Harris) hasn't spoken as much on policy as I would like to hear her speak on it,\" Sandoval said. \"She's got some good ideas, but I haven't heard as much as I would like.\"</p><p>Those who have counseled Harris, 54, a former prosecutor and California attorney general elected to the Senate in 2016, say she hews to a sense of pragmatism rather than a strict ideology.</p><p>\"She's pretty much a fundamentally pragmatic person ... always asking about: What is the real impact this is going to have on people's lives?\" said Jill Habig, who served as an adviser to Harris when she served as attorney general and in her Senate campaign. \"But in terms of the methodology of how you get to that goal, she's not very ideological.\"</p><p>The result, so far, is a policy portfolio that often seems comprised of one-off announcements that put her largely in line with long-held, mainstream Democratic positions.</p><p>The thread that has connected her proposals is an emphasis on what she has presented as practical actions that can be put in place while long-term solutions are hammered out. Harris' proposals for tightened controls on guns and a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants and their parents rely on executive action, an approach used by Trump and President Barack Obama in the face of opposition from Capitol Hill. Her proposals for rent assistance and a middle-class tax credit of up to $6,000 per year, her campaign staff argues, provide more short-term tangible benefits than, say, more dramatic moves like Warren's pledge to break up big tech companies.</p><p>She and her campaign aides argue her policy to raise teacher salaries by an average of $13,500 to match those of \"similarly educated professionals\" would improve student outcomes and school environments, achieving broad benefits by addressing the problem directly. But outside of a broader education policy, it was possible to see such a policy as an appeal to the highly influential teachers' unions and suburban women Harris is courting, rather than a piece in a broader policy puzzle.</p><p>When it comes to her broader policy drive, Harris doesn't spare much time for labels. Of all the words she has used since declaring her presidential candidacy, she has allocated few to positioning herself left of center, right of the far left, or anywhere in between.</p><p>When a voter in Ankeny, Iowa, said she heard the media labeling Harris as a moderate, the candidate raised her eyebrows and stifled a smile. When a reporter asked her if she would call herself \"an Obama Democrat,\" Harris said simply, \"I call myself Kamala.\"</p><p>Her approach to date has fostered support. She has raised millions of dollars, begun growing her ground operations in the four early voting states and even has a devoted fan club called \"the K-Hive,\" a takeoff on Beyonce's fan group.</p><p>Harris is also making a hiring push in Iowa that she says will give her more staffers there than any other candidate. In South Carolina, local organizer Brenda Price and her \"Reckoning Crew\" of 100 organizers just threw themselves behind Harris.</p><p>Early state polls show Harris' limitations and her potential. When California voters' first and second choices were tabulated by the Berkeley IGS poll, Harris was tied in her home state with Biden and Warren. But when voters were asked their first choice, Harris trailed those two candidates as well as Sanders. The results, which had Harris trailing even in her home turf of the Bay Area, echoed the results of a Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters, far more of whom were considering Harris than firmly committed to her.</p><p>In South Carolina over the weekend, a must-win state for Harris, she maintained one of the largest and most vocal groups of supporters that was as big as Biden's, Sanders' and Warren's, and thanks in part to that drum line, just as loud. The Rev. Jesse Jackson sneaked into her pre-convention rally.

A bit of a wobble in the morning, which we will need to discuss and find out why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic news here, the market likes what it is seeing. It is up pretty much across the board. We have records on the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P. Those are the markets and these are the reasons and factors why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conversation goes from recession to rebound. Revised growth numbers show the U.S. economy is picking up steam.</p><p>Manchester City, one of the world's most valuable sports franchises, after a new investment shows just how valuable.</p><p>Now, 40 pizzas in 30 days. Papa John himself says he gorged on his former company's pizza and he found it wanting.</p><p>We are live in the world's financial capital, New York City. It is Wednesday, it is November the 27th. I'm Richard Quest and of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, a Thanksgiving treat for Donald Trump has revised GDP numbers showed the U.S. economy grew faster than initially expected and faster than the quarter that came before it. The numbers are encouraging. Q3 up to 2.1 percent from 1.9 showing an economic slowdown may not be as severe.</p><p>Cristina Alesci is here. Look at those graphs. Look at the numbers. We were 1.9 and 2.1 now. This shows the economy is growing.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, normally, we wouldn't be talking about revised GDP numbers, but we're talking about it because everyone, a couple of months ago was worried about a potential recession, a downturn.</p><p>This obviously very good news politically for Donald Trump and his reelection bid. This is what he is hanging his hat on and telling the American people, you know, as of September that the market will crash, and the economy will hit a downturn if he is not reelected. So he is definitely playing on those concerns.</p><p>QUEST: But if we look at the other numbers. The only one I can see that's a bit worrying is consumer confidence, which is a sort of a strange number because that continues to trend downwards. But it's not empirical in the sense of a GDP number.</p><p>ALESCI: You're absolutely right. Consumers have been the backbone of this economy, and the reason that we're growing the way we are, it's offsetting some of the decline in business investment.</p><p>To your point, if we start to see weakness and that is a leading indicator as opposed to this GDP number that looks backwards. So if we start to see some of the leading indicators getting softer, that's when you know, people will start to worry -- analysts and investors will start to worry again.</p><p>But I think it's important to note, although this number is very good for Donald Trump, this is not that much different in terms of growth than the kind of growth that Obama generated.</p><p>So in terms of making a comparison, you know, we have to look at this as he inherited a pretty resilient economy to begin with.</p><p>QUEST: But six months ago, we were talking I'm worried about recession.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: That's now -- I was going to say gone, but certainly not around.</p><p>ALESCI: I think it's not around because the global economy seems to be holding up a little bit better than people expected. And also, the trade war hasn't hit the U.S. consumer, which again, is the backbone. That's why we saw you know, this sort of thawing of tensions between the U.S. and China because Donald Trump knows that if he hits, you know, consumer goods with tariffs, that that could impact the very good narrative that he has out there right now.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, no good narrative, the market up 47 at the moment, but we're at a record, successive records over multiple days. And, you know --</p><p>ALESCI: And new highs.</p><p>QUEST: Donald Trump is very good at sort of ignoring it when the market goes down. Extremely trumpeting it once it's at record, but there is valid reason for that. The markets are at records.</p><p>ALESCI: Are there valid reasons? I don't know that there are valid reasons. I think there's just a lot of optimism about future growth, but I'm not sure what it's rooted in.</p><p>I mean, it seems to be rooted in the potential for corporate profits to grow. But where is the growth going to come from? Where is this exponential growth going to come from?</p><p>Look, a lot of this sort of is trading feeding on itself. If you feel good, other people feel good, and there's a sense of optimism about the future. But at any given moment, and you know this, the sentiment can change on Wall Street.</p><p>You know, if we don't get some kind of resolution, if we don't get to a Phase 1 trade deal, then that can turn really quickly.</p><p>[15:05:09]</p><p>QUEST: Have a good Thanksgiving. You doing duty?</p><p>ALESCI: Just for you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. Excellent.</p><p>ALESCI: Just for you.</p><p>QUEST: Thanks very much, Cristina Alesci. The new GDP numbers weren't the only good news on Wednesday. Other economic data showed that U.S. economy is still solid. There you have the Dow, but look at the triple stack.</p><p>Of all the countries, the U.S. is one of the few that been able to withstand the pressures from the trade war. So all three indices are at record highs.</p><p>Now the poorer one of course, remember, it was just a few weeks ago that we were having the S&amp;P through 3,000 and now, we are off over 3,100. Twenty eight thousand is a solid level for the Dow at the moment. And the NASDAQ, the best of the session.</p><p>Rana is with us. Rana Foroohar is the Associate Editor at \"The Financial Times,\" and good to see you Rana, and also the author of the new book, \"Don't Be Evil.\" She is with me. This is impressive in the sense that the economic -- I was talking to Cristina, you heard the conversation, the doomsayers said it was all going to be over, turn off the lights and put out the milk bottles.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Absolutely. But you know, I'm going to go back to what I've been saying for years. It's the Fed keeping the markets up. I mean, I think that when you start to see the turn, it was when the Fed said we're going to expand our balance sheet again, we all know -- we've had this conversation before. This is financialized growth. This is about asset prices staying up.</p><p>There's not really an underlying growth story. So I'm interested in that consumer confidence number because I think if that starts to weaken further --</p><p>QUEST: Right. If it is trending down, it is of all the numbers, I was reading, consumer confidence is the weakest one. But if the Fed is -- not the only, but the primary thing propping this up, then when they sought to hold and indicate tightening, you'd expect the same thing we saw last year, not maybe not as fast or furious.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, I think though -- I mean, it's amazing to me, I thought that the Fed was at some point going to capitulate and say, look, monetary policy is done. We've got to have a real growth story. They haven't.</p><p>You know, I think the Fed is in this really interesting -- interesting and worrisome position, frankly, where they know they are the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession and you know, major trouble in the rest of the world because of that.</p><p>I really believe that and I think that they feel like they can't let the economy fall apart.</p><p>QUEST: But what they want from the government in this -- from the administration because deficit -- you can't have more spending because --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>QUEST: All right, you can have better spending, more scarce --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Better spending. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: You can have that. Yes. But the deficit is already at unseasonably uncomfortable levels.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>QUEST: You had tax cuts. They've been gone and there's not much room for more, so when you say the Fed is the only game in town, what else could there be?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I think it's all about politics now. It's about what happens in 2020. If we get another Donald Trump presidency, I think we've got to have a big market correction.</p><p>On the other hand, if you get -- if you get -- seriously, and if you get -- because there's no growth story there. I mean, we have -- we're not going to get a real trade deal with China. We're not getting -- there's talk of some industrial policy, you know, good luck. There's no 360 view in how to connect the dots between job creators and educators.</p><p>On the other hand, who is the Democratic candidate going to be?</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about technology.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Your new book, \"Don't Be Evil.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes. Good title, right?</p><p>QUEST: Well, you do good, don't be evil, no evil, do no evil. Are you lumping them all together?</p><p>FOROOHAR: No, actually, there's different stories here. But the primary story is the Google/Facebook targeted advertising story. And actually, the reason I chose \"Don't Be Evil,\" of course, is that's the old Google model that they've sort of quietly let go a couple of years ago.</p><p>And Facebook gets a lot of hate, rightfully so. But if you go back and look at why we're at the point we're at today where huge monopoly power in corporations in tech and particular, political polarization, kids getting addicted to technologies. It's because of Google. It is because of the fact that they started this highly targeted advertising model in the 19 -- mid-1990s. And that's the arc that we've been following.</p><p>Now, they're trying to make some changes. But this is the core business model. It's all about surveillance capitalism. It's about following you around online and increasingly offline and monetizing.</p><p>QUEST: But why is this an evil?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, my gosh, where to where to begin, Richard?</p><p>QUEST: No, but come on. I use Google all the time for my search. But I don't suddenly find myself frothing at the mouth to buy things because I see 15 adverts. I get a bit maybe frustrated and annoyed.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Think about though, all right, Google is going into healthcare. It's going into finance. Think about the insurance model and you know, you might be able to get great deals because you're an affluent person.</p><p>Predatory lending at the bottom. It's split -- you know, this model of surveillance, capitalism splits everybody into individuals. There's no shared risk pool anymore.</p><p>QUEST: Don't go anywhere, ma'am.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I won't.</p><p>QUEST: If you will be as kind. Because you'll be aware, of course in the United Kingdom, the Labour Party has a very different view on what it believes democratic capitalism should look like in a modern social democratic --</p><p>[15:10:30]</p><p>QUEST: We will get into that in just a moment.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Big changes afoot.</p><p>QUEST: Well, it depends on the electorate. But yes. Yes, indeed. Don't go too far.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I won't do.</p><p>QUEST: We are hearing that the Trump administration has moved to substantially cut its contributions to NATO. Now, don't get excited. It's a largely symbolic move. It's not the national defense budget. It's actually the money they give to NATO to help pay for the keeping the lights on.</p><p>The President is preparing to attend the NATO Summit next week to mark the organization's 70th anniversary and officials tell CNN that other NATO members are expected to make up the shortfall.</p><p>Pentagon reporter Ryan Browne is with us. Ryan, as I said, this isn't a national defense budget. This is sort of the money that goes to NATO to pay to keep on the lights. Why are they doing it?</p><p>RYAN BROWNE, CNN PENTAGON REPORTER: Well, it's part of the Trump administration's broader effort to get European allies to do more. You know, ever since he was a candidate, President Trump had long slammed European members of NATO for not contributing enough to their defense. Their defense budgets being too low, falling below the two percent of GDP target that the Alliance recommends.</p><p>So they haven't -- they've had some success getting some of the allies to boost their defense spending. But, you know, as part of that broader effort, they're kind of touting this effort to get them to pay more for the running of the headquarters. It's about $2 billion or so for that kind of central pot of money.</p><p>And so they have been pushing these allies to do more and they've actually been able to successfully this week, we're being told, right on the eve of this Summit, get the allies to agree to contribute -- nearly all the allies -- to agree to contribute more to offset the U.S. reduction.</p><p>Now, again, it's not a huge amount of money, but it does kind of set the tone for this Summit in London that's coming up, you know, previous Summits where President Trump has attended and NATO have been a bit combative when it's come to resources, particularly clashes with Germany in particular.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>BROWNE: So again, it's a bit of a victory for the Trump administration going into this Summit, whether they'll be able to get any other increased contributions while the Summit is taking place remains to be seen.</p><p>QUEST: Come back to us with more on this one. We will watch closely. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Now after the break, more than 160 economists and academics have come out in support of Britain's Labour Party and its economic policies.</p><p>How many pizzas did you eat this month? Ten? Fifteen? How about 40? Forty in 30 days. The former CEO of Papa John's Pizza says he has done it and he is not impressed with the product of the company his name is on. In a moment.</p><p>[15:15:39]</p><p>QUEST: A new sporting record has been set by one of the world's biggest tech investment funds. Silver Lake is buying a 10 percent stake that is worth $500 million in the City Football Group which is the owner of several football clubs around the world including Manchester City. The deal values the group at $4.8 billion.</p><p>Matt Egan is here. So who are these -- who is these group City Football Group that's selling?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: Well, they own Man City. They own soccer clubs, football clubs, excuse me, throughout Europe, the United States, Australia, China, Japan and what they're doing is they're getting this $500 million cash injection from Silver Lake Partners, and they can use that money to further expand by buying more football clubs around the world.</p><p>I think what's really interesting is that this investment is coming from a California-based private equity firm that we know for investing in tech companies.</p><p>I mean, they are known for having stakes in Dell and Alibaba. They once owned Skype. And what they've actually done those they've diversified. They've gone into entertainment and sports. They own shares in mixed martial arts, UFC and also in MSG, which owns the Knicks and the Rangers here in New York.</p><p>QUEST: So why have they done it?</p><p>EGAN: I think they're simply following the money. I can't blame them.</p><p>QUEST: Well, what money? Because the company -- Man City itself has not done spectacularly well financially on the fields with their results.</p><p>EGAN: But what we're seeing is that sports franchise valuations have gone through the roof. This deal done at $4.8 billion. Just two months ago, the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA, they did a deal at $2.4 billion. \"Forbes\" pegs the Dallas Cowboys at $5 billion. And that's because TV contracts have just been lavished on these sports teams.</p><p>It's really the Holy Grail right now, live sports, because people are obviously cutting that cords. They're going to Netflix, but you can't do that when it comes to live sports.</p><p>QUEST: What do you do though about in Manchester City's case? Where does it go? I mean, what would Silver Lake do with its stake? Just sit and watch it grow?</p><p>EGAN: Well, they've said that -- at least, according to \"The Financial Times,\" they've indicated that they want to hold this for about a decade, although they also said they could potentially sell some shares.</p><p>But listen, sitting on a sports franchise investment has been great one. I think it's time, Richard that we stop calling them trophy assets. They've been truly spectacular investments if you can get a piece of them.</p><p>QUEST: Good way for us to move on. Thank you, Matt. Trophy assets is what Matt Egan described them. Well, the days when the sports teams were trophy assets may be coming to an end.</p><p>According to \"Forbes,\" the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL are the most valuable franchise, some $5 billion boosted by TV rights, merchandise and deals and sponsorships.</p><p>The New York Yankees come next and you can see as it goes down the fort, the football rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona, they are both at $4 billion. Not far behind.</p><p>Manchester -- by the way, Manchester United comes into number six at $3.8 billion. But way down the list. It's not even on the list, it's way down, 27th is Manchester City. Twenty-fifth on the list.</p><p>Don Riddell is with us to talk about this. Don, you know, the days when the Mansours bought their stakes and cashed in or bought into what they perceived was just a vanity Matt Egan says it is gone.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes, I think it would be hard to argue with that. I mean, just look at the valuation. It is just extraordinary. As you were saying, earlier this year, \"Forbes\" had Man City $2.69 billion and now we're close to five. Admittedly, that is the valuation of CFG, the City Football Group, which owns a number of clubs, but there is no doubt that Manchester City is the jewel in the crown here, and this valuation is absolutely extraordinary.</p><p>QUEST: And all that of -- I mean, looking at our top 10 list. Of the top 10 from the Dallas Cowboys to the Los Angeles Dodgers, which ones deserve to be there, so to speak?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, it's interesting because if you look at that list, it means you don't have to be successful on the field to be valued at $5 billion. I mean, the Dallas Cowboys, famously were great once upon a time.</p><p>They haven't won the Super Bowl in decades, but yet they seem to be a sporting franchise with this phenomenal wealth and investors willing to put money into them.</p><p>[15:20:12]</p><p>RIDDELL: So that is interesting. Manchester City, there is no doubt about it, one of the top teams in Europe. They've won the Premier League four times in the last seven years. They've won the last two. They won an unprecedented domestic trove of trophies in England this year.</p><p>They're not doing quite so well in the Premier League at the moment, but they are into the knockout stages of the Champions League, which is the one tournament that they absolutely crave. That's the one that's eluded them.</p><p>But to Matt's point earlier about live television and live sport. There was an argument made recently that the NFL in the United States is basically the one thing that is keeping the television model, the business model as we know it in place. Without football, television would look so very different. And I think you can apply that same argument to other top sports, like soccer, like football all around the world.</p><p>QUEST: Don Riddell. Thank you, sir. Always excellent to have you with the business of sports. I appreciate it.</p><p>We are two weeks until the U.K. general election. A group of economists and academics have thrown their weight behind the opposition Labour Party.</p><p>A hundred sixty three of them have signed a letter saying that Labour deserves to form the next government for its spending plans. Now, the spending plans involved include 275 billion pounds in public investments to kick start growth and raise productivity.</p><p>A million new jobs through Green Industrial Revolution, and perhaps most controversially, nationalizing certain industries like the railways and Royal Mail.</p><p>Now, Stephany Griffith-Jones is an economist and the Financial Markets Program Director at Columbia University. She joins me from Brighton in the U.K. She joins me via Skype. What is it? I mean, I've read the letter, and I've read a large part of the manifesto on economic policy, but it seems to me, it is turning the clock back to many of the policies that the Wilsonian, that the Callaghan years did that the Duchy has just simply reversed.</p><p>STEPHANY GRIFFITH-JONES, ECONOMIST AND FINANCIAL MARKETS PROGRAM DIRECTOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (via Skype): I'm delighted to be on your show which I'm a big fan, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: I think it's actually turning the clock forward, if I may disagree with you, because one of the big challenges for the future that the United Kingdom faces, as does the rest of the world is combating climate change.</p><p>And for that, to put it in American -- using an American expression, we need a Green New Deal. And this is one of the areas which Labour would really be able to fulfill, both by increasing public investment as you mentioned, and also by creating a National Investment Bank, like the ones that Germany and France have to encourage private investment.</p><p>So the public spending would lead to public investment, to levels that are not much higher, or in fact, even similar, very similar to those of France and Germany and other European countries.</p><p>QUEST: The plans for taxation, for example, don't seem to I mean, I mean, I've read both the funding side of it as well, or the funding document, and it's costed out, but there's two new tax brackets that are introduced, including a super tax bracket, but no details on how much or how it will operate.</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: I think there is a focus, as you say, on taxing the very rich, the sort of so-called richest five percent and they would be taxed at a higher rate, five percent more in marginal terms.</p><p>There's also an emphasis on taxing multinational corporations in proportion and I think this is very fair and interesting system in proportion to the sales and the number of employees and profits they have in the country.</p><p>QUEST: Is there not a risk though? Because, obviously the corporate tax rates as well. But under Labour, will they be competitive at a time particularly as the U.K. comes out of the E.U. assuming Brexit goes ahead, which for the purpose of this question, assume that happens. I mean, there is a race to the bottom largely started by the United States on corporate tax rates. The U.K. will fare badly if Labour hikes rates.</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: Can I just answer one of your sub questions? If Labour is elected, we would have a referendum where there would either be the possibility of remaining, which I think would be the best for the U.K. and including for business.</p><p>I mean, they have been really crying out for that. Or it will be a very, very soft Brexit.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: Which I think is certainly best. So that in itself would make Britain again an attractive country for investment, which has now completely slowed down. So I think that that that would be a big advantage for business as well, and for ordinary people.</p><p>[15:25:24]</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: But the other point is, you're right, that there is a race to the bottom. But for example, in other E.U. countries, corporation tax is much higher than it is in the U.K. at the moment and it would be even higher than it would be under Labour.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>GRIFFITH-JONES: So if we are competing for attracting investments, say with mainly E.U. countries which we do, then we will not be in a bad position.</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you, Stephany. Thank you very much indeed. Rana is with me again. This is a very unusual manifesto in the sense that it does seem to turn back the clock on the prevailing wisdom.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, it would be the biggest change in the U.K. economy since - - really since the big bang in the 1980s. Right? That's your Reagan Revolution.</p><p>Now, you know, there are those who feel that the pendulum shifts between public and private power about once every 40 or 50 years. And so we're probably due for this kind of shift.</p><p>I think the success of this manifesto, assuming that we had a Corbyn government would really be about execution. So you take something like the idea of nationalizing the broadband service in the U.K., I'm actually pro government involvement in certain things like broadband, because it's tough to get private investment to roll it out as quickly as needed, but are you going to make it free? I don't think that's a great idea. So the devil is really in the details, I think.</p><p>QUEST: Also the National Investment Bank that Stephany was talking about that other countries have, these are nice ideas, but as you said, the way it is executed and Britain has had a spectacularly bad history of public ownership?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, that's actually very true, and it's going to be interesting to see how that plays at, you know, in the ballot box whether people remember that.</p><p>I mean, the city is already spooked, you know, this. I mean, the hedge funds are fleeing. Folks are setting up contingency plans. There's a sense that this is going to be a massive change for the entire financial sector.</p><p>QUEST: Is it the government's business to be owning the broadband network?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I actually think it is, and I'll tell you why. I think that there are certain areas of infrastructure where it's really hard to get enough investment quickly enough, it's just not as profitable.</p><p>I mean, think about, you know, the infrastructure conversation we're having in the U.S. as well. You know, real estate agents would -- or sorry, real estate companies would rather build condos than bridges. I mean, there are certain areas that you need nationalized support and security as well an issue here. But it's tough. It's really tough to execute this stuff, and I think it's going to be so interesting --</p><p>QUEST: A spoof advert going around at the moment in Britain with an actress called Maureen Lipman, who supposedly on the phone, she says get your hands off my broadband.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I don't know. You know, I mean if BT was rolling it out faster, people wouldn't be complaining, but it's tough. Big tech maybe should be part of this, to go back to my book.</p><p>QUEST: \"Don't Be Evil.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR: \"Don't Be Evil.\" Google pay up, help build rural broadband.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, no. But hang on, arguably, Google would be delighted to help pay for it.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, I don't know.</p><p>QUEST: But what would it gain in return?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, exactly. Exactly. Devil in the details.</p><p>QUEST: Where I come from in Northern Yorkshire -- in West Yorkshire, we have a saying, you get owt for nowt.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I'm going to steal that.</p><p>QUEST: Owt for nowt. There we go. Thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You too.</p><p>QUEST: Now, the global backlash against vaping continues in other major markets. It is first banning e-cigarettes.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. We're going to look at how tobacco companies are reacting to a likely ban on e-cigarettes in India. And travel chaos just one way if you look, flights grounded, roads are blocked, and it couldn't happen at a worse time in the United States as more than 30 million Americans travel home for Thanksgiving. This is CNN and here, the facts always come first.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" is reporting Donald Trump knew about the whistleblower complaint when he finally released military aid to Ukraine in September. We're learning that a White House budget official who initially signed off on the aid freeze feared it could violate federal law, it's all according to transcripts of depositions in the house impeachment probe.</p><p>The Trump administration is to reduce its contribution to NATO's budget, according to several sources, it's a symbolic move largely to pay for things like NATO itself, rather than actually national defense. Other members are expected to make up the shortfall.</p><p>The U.K. Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn is under fresh pressure of allegations of anti-Semitism within his party after he failed to apologize over the issue. Four times he was asked to do so in a \"BBC\" interview that came on the same day as the U.K. chief rabbi launched a scathing attack on the Labor Party's handling of the anti-Semitism issue.</p><p>A day of mourning in Albania after the country's most powerful earthquake in decades on Tuesday. Rescue crews are still sifting through the rubble, using drones and search dogs to reach survivors. At least, 30 people are confirmed to have died and hundreds of people are known to be injured.</p><p>If you're traveling in part of the USA within the next day or so, there will be delays, there's no getting away from it. Early Winter storms are disrupting travel at the Thanksgiving, in the west, heavy snow is been driven by hurricane-force winds, and the storm is so powerful it's being called a bomb cyclone.</p><p>India's parliament has passed a bill making it illegal to manufacture import or sell e-cigarettes. It's a country of more than a 100 million smokers. People who violate the ban could face a year in prison for a first offense. Dorian Fuhrman is the co-founder of the PAVe, grassroots organization against vaping.</p><p>Let's get to the bigger issue, it's -- I mean I've been to India a gazillion times and smoking is just everywhere. Is it reasonable to assume that this law will be obeyed?</p><p>DORIAN FUHRMAN, CO-FOUNDER, PAVE: Well, that's hard to say. I mean, what we do know is that vaping is not proving to help adult smokers stop smoking.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>So, if that's the reason that people hope that it gets into India, then, you know, there's no proof. There's no proof. So, kids in America have been smoking in record numbers, and they were sucked in by the fun fruity designs and high tech stealth devices. They came into our schools, the predatory practices of these companies.</p><p>They targeted kids where they live on social media and they came into our school and they have created this youth vaping epidemic. So, it's a very serious concern, there's no proof that it helps adult smokers quit.</p><p>QUEST: Well, we had the head of -- we had from British-American tobacco. You know, the problem for your organization to some and others similar is that, the tobacco industry sits here and says clearly, we do not want people to smoke.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: We think vaping is an alternative for those who are existing smokers. And we don't think you should start vaping if you're not already smoking.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right.</p><p>QUEST: So, you're at a bit of a loss. You're always like you're pushing against a stream here because they've given you all the answers you want.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right, well, they say what they want -- what they think they want us to hear, and it's not -- it's not true. I mean, basically kids who have -- who would have never picked up a cigarette in America are now vaping in record numbers. And it's actually proven that kids who vape are now four times more likely to start smoking whereas they would have never smoked before.</p><p>QUEST: Some of the reports that I remember reading a few months ago in \"The Times\" of the effects of vaping, of addictive vaping --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And the personality changes that take place.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Yes -- no, they're very true. The nicotine affects the developing adolescent brain, it causes change in personality, in memory, in mood control. It opens up pathways for further addiction, so kids are more likely to start using other substances. But it's really -- it's the anger, the extreme anger that these kids get when they can't get their devices or even just the effect on their emotions of the nicotine because they've never had such high levels of nicotine.</p><p>The cigarettes of today do not have these high levels of patented nicotine salt which goes directly to the adolescent brain.</p><p>QUEST: So -- I hesitate to put it in such vulgar terms, which is that between vaping and smoking, you're basically saying smoking is safer?</p><p>FUHRMAN: I'm not saying smoking is safer.</p><p>QUEST: No, but you know something --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: The alternative is clearly so awful, so tell me --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Well, kids would have never -- in America kids would have never picked up a cigarette. I mean, the public health groups in America have done such an amazing job, you know, getting kids off cigarettes, and now they're vaping in record numbers and they're going to start smoking again. And so that's a huge problem.</p><p>QUEST: Here's my problem. At the moment, vaping, JUUL and the companies that are involved and all of them, they are perfectly legal business activities. You may not like them.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: But they're not against the law.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Well, some of them are, actually. So, the FDA has not yet regulated all of these devices. They keep pushing them off. They keep pushing the regulation off to 2020.</p><p>QUEST: But my point is that until they are banned --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: Surely these companies should be entitled to go about their business.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Well --</p><p>QUEST: By all means prosecute a ban.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: But until they do, oh, it's like cigarettes. Until they ban, people can smoke.</p><p>FUHRMAN: Well, but that's happening in America now, they're being banned in state-after-state because the FDA is not doing their job to regulate these devices the way they need to be regulated. And you know, there's no proof again that these devices are safer than cigarettes. What's proven is that there have been no long term longitudinal studies to show that they definitely help adult smokers quit smoking.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Thank you so much --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much, indeed, thank you --</p><p>FUHRMAN: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now, bad news for Boeing or at least more bad news. The aircraft manufacturer is having trouble getting its planes to customers, and the problem is not just the 737 Max. We'll look at the various planes that Boeing makes in just a moment.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: Bank shares are down on Wednesday after the \"Seattle Times\" published a photograph that showed the fuselage crack in the 777 X. Now, there you have it. This was the crack, it occurred -- we've known about this. It occurred during an extreme test of the 777 X's plane strength. Now, this was the last test that was meant to take place, they're all watching it.</p><p>They pressurized the aircraft, they bent -- so, the idea was they bent the wings up and then they bent the nose down, and the fuselage down, and they pressurized it to an absolute 99 percent of limit. It was supposed to have of course stayed in one peace, but then at the moment, the fuselage just at the back cracked.</p><p>We thought it was the rear door blowing off, but that's the first picture. For Boeing, it's an addition to a load of other issues facing it. So, you've got the 737 Max where the FAA is still reviewing, we know the problems of that. You've got the 737 NG, now that, it needs a redesign of its nacelles and cowls for the engine. It's also of course got problems with the pickle fork which is between the fuselage and the wings.</p><p>Then you've got the 777 X. This is the big hope for the future, unfortunately, deliveries are now pushed back into early 2021. Again, it was a challenging schedule that they'd set themselves. But it's -- the issue there, of course, and I think where the thing fell off or blew up was just about there. And then you've got Boeing cutting production of the Dreamliner because of demand concerns.</p><p>You've also got problems with the Dreamliner and the Rolls-Royce engines. The Trent 2000 engines, enormous problems. In fact, Norwegian today announced that it was cutting certain routes because it's having so many problems with its 787 Trent engines. So, you get an idea. All of this at a time of great travel, CNN's Rene Marsh has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, the FAA in a letter to Boeing said that the agency will inspect and sign off on all 737 Max planes before they're delivered to the airlines. Now, this was an authority that Boeing once had. It's the controversial practice that essentially allowed the manufacturer to self-police by performing its own safety checks on planes before they delivered it.</p><p>This move by the FAA though can only be read in one way. It is a public push-back on the pressure that the agency says that it's been feeling from the manufacturer to accelerate the process of getting this plane back in the air. Now, the FAA is making very clear in this latest move that it's not working on Boeing's timeline.</p><p>As Boeing is itching to start delivering the backlog of jets to airline customers. So, it's very important to realize that Boeing has been in a crunch. Its financials have suffered during the months-long grounding and its 737 Max production line which has slowed, but not completely stopped.</p><p>Is turning out some 42 jets every month. And so, it is running out of space to store these finished planes. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>QUEST: Well, it doesn't really matter what your plane is if you're in these conditions, you ain't going anywhere. If you're traveling to or from the United States, be prepared for major disruptions. There was snowstorms and systems that could impact millions of travelers, 30 million are going to take to the roads and the air over the next few days as with Thanksgiving and the holiday season.</p><p>They were blizzard warnings in effect, and the west, and powerful winds and snow is hitting the Midwest and moving east where I am. It's so powerful it's called a bomb cyclone. And the chaos is already grounded hundreds upon hundreds of flights. CNN's Ryan Young joins us from Minneapolis, Minnesota where dozens of flights have been canceled.</p><p>Is it actually cold where you are?</p><p>RYAN YOUNG, CNNU.S. CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Richard. Look, the last time we talked to you, we were covered by some buildings. We decided to move to give you an idea of the full force of this. First of all, more than nine inches of snow has fallen. You could see some of the remnants here.</p><p>It has stopped snowing in the last few hours, but as you look in this direction, you can sort of see the Winter wonderland has been left behind, Richard, as we talked about this before though. It does have an impact on travel because the slick roads is what everybody is concerned about.</p><p>We're on a bridge, and here on this bridge, you can see they've been doing a good job of salting and sort of moving and plowing the snow. But we have seen several accidents. In fact, almost 200 accidents have happened in Minnesota where people really know how to drive in the snow, 300 spinouts.</p><p>And here's the part that you know about, Richard because you've worked outside before. That cold hits you in the lungs and that steady breeze makes the feel-like temperature a lot lower. Of course, with some 50 million Americans expected to be driving around for turkey day, they're hoping that people will get home --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>YOUNG: And out of the way before it gets cold --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>YOUNG: And some of the roads sort of re-ice over.</p><p>QUEST: The real problem of course, is that people will be starting their journeys, and you know -- and the traffic, the awfulness of the weather, they may not complete them or they may get where they're going and not be able to get back.</p><p>YOUNG: You know what? That's always a concern. But I think what's happened is, with the storm, somehow the timing has sort of worked out in everyone's favor so far. The nine inches, the ten inches of snow that we may have received here happened before the airport really got rolling. So, we only had 35 delays here in Minneapolis, about a 100 -- actually a 100 delays and then about 35 cancellations --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>YOUNG: And that's good news as you know as someone who flies all the time. We were just talking to a pilot at a hotel, he was saying because all the snow fell early, they were able to --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>YOUNG: Get out of here, and this is of course a big international hub. So, that's one of the good news so far.</p><p>QUEST: You know, I always remember that saying, there's no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing. So, I trust that you are -- well, we dealt with thermals earlier. Good to see you, thank you, sir. Thank you, oh, go ahead, go ahead, you were going to say --</p><p>YOUNG: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You were going to say?</p><p>YOUNG: No, I was going to say, Richard, as a guy who grew up in Florida, you know, the idea of seeing all this snow just fall like this and just be parked on the side, especially during the holidays, it's something that we used to joke with our relatives about.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>YOUNG: We would send them e-mails and say, hey, it's 75 here. Guess what? My family did the same thing to me, they're like, hey, it's 79 here in Miami, enjoy that weather up there in Minneapolis. The good news so far is at least no major accidents, that's the good news that we can report, even though it's a little chilly up here, and I'm sure my face is completely frozen just yet.</p><p>QUEST: It will be and if we keep you there for longer, it certainly will be. Sheer sadism. Good to see you, sir, thank you very much indeed. All right, let me bring you some details. New explosions have hit a chemicals factory plant in Texas. The first explosion was at 1 O'clock this morning, the blast -- there it -- let's just watch those pictures.</p><p>Apparently, it was so strong it sucked the doors out of the frames. The fire continues to burn, it's very powerful. It's obviously fuel-fed, and local authorities say they're still trying to work out what actually happened. Now, we'll be back in a moment.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST: The founder and former CEO of Papa John's Pizza has gone cold on the project that he used to sell. John Schnatter who started the firm in '84 is now becoming embroiled in a very nasty row by NFL player protests. He eventually resigned. In an interview with a Kentucky TV station, he said he believes the company is being mismanaged.</p><p>He told \"WDLB\", \"I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days, and it's not the same pizza. It doesn't taste as good. This is all a farce.\" All right, so I worked it out, that's 10 pizzas in a week which is what we've got here, 10 pizzas. Now, John claims he ate each week for a month, ten of them.</p><p>Paul La Monica is here. Paul?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Oh, gosh --</p><p>QUEST: Don't let me stop you.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think I may stop myself. What do you want to talk about? Do you really want me to take a slice of pizza?</p><p>QUEST: No, I don't, no, I don't. The -- what's gone wrong here? I mean, is the pizza -- is the fact that Papa John's is saying the pizza is not any good any more, is that going to be taken seriously?</p><p>LA MONICA: I don't think it is because John Schnatter is a very tarnished figure right now. Obviously, he was forced to step down, and he is still the largest shareholder in the company. But he's been continuously selling his stake -- you know, and it's down from about, you know, 9.5 percent a few months ago, to you know, about 4 percent or so now. So, you can't help --</p><p>QUEST: But why would he be -- why would he be rude about a company or is he, he might be right, we don't know until we try the pizza. Or you know, he's trying to kick-start them to get their quality back up again.</p><p>LA MONICA: Well, he's claiming that the quality is not there. I think that the numbers may tell a different story because even though Papa John's continues to struggle, and their sales have been declining in the U.S., they're not declining as rapidly as they were at the height of the whole NFL scandal and other issues that he has become -- you know, a problem child for that company.</p><p>And I think now, you have a new CEO -- I'm waiting for to you take a bite here and tell me what you think. It's got a new CEO, formerly of Arby's who's come in, and the stock is up pretty dramatically this year without the Papa John of Papa John's being in charge. You've got to put some of this garlic special sauce on there, although --</p><p>QUEST: Are you serious?</p><p>LA MONICA: They gave it to you for a reason, hey? Better you than me.</p><p>QUEST: Is it really active -- I mean, you wouldn't eat any of this. I mean, you turned your head up, didn't you?</p><p>LA MONICA: I'm a pizza snob, like I said, I live in Brooklyn, I can get good pizza at any local establishment -- and oh, my gosh --</p><p>QUEST: Stop it --</p><p>LA MONICA: I don't even want to know what chemicals are in that.</p><p>QUEST: It's Thanksgiving tomorrow.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes. I am thankful that you are taking one for the team and eating it instead of me.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, sir, that's a problem --</p><p>LA MONICA: Oh, yes --</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>QUEST: Right now, forgive me, because we're not supposed to talk with our mouth full. As we head to the break, Paul La Monica, who will be -- by the way, don't worry about those pizzas, none will go to waste, I assure you. We have a television studio, television crew, pizza? It's a match made in heaven. There you go, market is down -- comes up, though, so we are at a record, up over 40 points, not much, nothing to really write home about.</p><p>But it is a record, and we have records for the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq, all of them at records as we go into Thanksgiving. There will be no trading tomorrow of course, and a shorter day on Friday. All right, we will take a short break, there will be a profitable moment while I remove pizza from the back molars.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. There's been so much talked about with Boeing and the 787 -- 737 Max. But it's not just our plane as I had talked about tonight that has a range of issues affecting the plane maker. The 777 X and the blowing out of the fuselage on its last test. The 787 and problems with the engines, the Rolls-Royce engines.</p><p>To be sure that's not just Boeing, that's not Boeing's problem per se, but it is the airline's issues, the 737 engine. Any one of these problems could be expected. All aircraft have them, the 380 has problems, the 320 nearers have issues. But for them all to arrive on Boeing's doorstep at the same time, when seemingly there's a lack of direction, that's the serious point.</p><p>Now, I don't doubt for one moment that Boeing will sort all these things out, but it's taken a terrible toll on the company and its reputation. And that's not going to change. The airlines are going to have to stick with Boeing, they've got planes in their fleet and billions of dollars committed.</p><p>But Boeing needs to prove that in each of the programs that are currently in problems, that they can sort them out and do it quickly. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>There we go, father Christmas at the Stock Exchange, Macy's of course, the day is over, the bell is ringing, records!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019112701cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-GXP1-DXH2-602C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vaping</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NATO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jeremy Corbyn</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anti-Semitism</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHV1</classCode><className>ANTISEMITISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The cybercrime branch has recently solved a host of high profile cases including Jio Infocomm's unauthorized data leak case.</p><p><br/> Cybercrime department gets at least three-four corporate cybercrime cases in a week. The corporates that didn't come forward earlier now openly disclose the attack incidents and lodge complaints. The sophisticated business email compromise cases are quite common among all received complaints. Cybercriminals often inject messages in the trail mails and change the invoice numbers and bank account to siphon off money.<br/> The number of cyber attacks is increasing each day. Globally big tech giants like Yahoo, Equifax have been targeted to compromise a large amount of data. Just the Q2 of 2017 reported 311 publicly disclosed security incidents. The lack of security regulations and a small amount of money invested in fighting cyber attacks is making Indian companies the easy target of cyber attackers.<br/> In last two months, India's two of the top private banks, telecom company, a top media company and the stock exchange have been the victim of major cyber attacks. Except the financial services that are mandated by the RBI, private companies hit by cybercrime hide the cybercrime incidents. Given the scale of threat, Indian companies are not investing enough in security.<br/> Reliance Jio was recently attacked by cybercriminals, leaking a part of its database. Star media was hit by the attackers, leaking unreleased episodes of Game of Thrones. Another reported attack on Union Bank leaked the access codes for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Axis Bank was hit by unauthorized offshore hackers. 17 million user records were stolen from Zomato's servers.<br/> Big Indian organizations like Renault India, Yes Bank, IRCTC, Hitachi Payment Systems, Bank of Maharashtra and Reckitt Benckiser India were reportedly hit by cyberattackers in last few months. Indian companies need to beef up the security to fight against the cyberattacks.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CFOIND-n10231775</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CFOIND2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PSX-P2M1-JBYT-H30W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CFO</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 24, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000C48N</classCode><className>YES BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0006QU3</classCode><className>BANK OF MAHARASHTRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008ZEO</classCode><className>RECKITT BENCKISER INDIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>YESBANK (NSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MAHABANK (NSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EFX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SQW</classCode><className>PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000350</classCode><className>COMPUTER CRIME</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBMUY1NEJCRTYyNEU2NDgwMzk4QzhBOTBEMTk1MDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY</classCode><className>Computer Crimes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009VZU</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;
