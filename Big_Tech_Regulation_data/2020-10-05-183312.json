Let's take them one at a time.I use the wordderealizationto describe the inner disconnect between what we experience and what the propaganda / marketing complex we live in tells us we should be experiencing.Put another way:our lived experience is derealized (dismissed as not real) by official spin and propaganda.The current state of the economy is a good example.We see the real-world economy declining yet the officially approved narrative is that there's a V-shaped recovery underway because Big Tech stocks are hitting new highs. In other words, we don't need a real-world economy, all we need is a digital economy provided by Big Tech platforms.This is derealization at its finest:the everyday world you experience directly no longer matters; what matters is stock prices and various statistics that all paint a rosy picture.Meanwhile, the wealthiest class is fleeing soon-to-be-bankrupt cities. The wealthiest class has the means to buy the best advice and also has the most to lose, so I give their actions far more credence than official propaganda.I've sketched out my thesis ondenormalizationinThe \"New Normal\" Is De-Normalization[1]andHere's Why the \"Impossible\" Economic Collapse Is Unavoidable[2]:This is why denormalization is an extinction event for much of our high-cost, high-complexity, heavily regulated economy. </p><p>Subsidizing high costs doesn't stop the dominoes from falling, as subsidies are not a substitute for the virtuous cycle of re-investment.The Fed's project of lowering the cost of capital to zero doesn't generate this virtuous cycle; all it does is encouragesocially useless speculative predation.Collapse isn't \"impossible,\" it's unavoidable.The basic idea is that all the structures of the \"normal\" economy only function at full capacity, as costs have moved higher, unproductive complexity has increased and our ability to pay these higher costs is based on ever-expanding debt.As a result, \"normal\" became extremely fragile and binary:it's either fully funded at full capacity or it collapses. The structures of everyday life (to use Braudel's apt phrase) are incapable of downsizing to 70% of their previous complexity and cost, much less 50%.There won't be any \"new normal\" because the system has become too rigid, ossified, over-regulated and controlled by entrenched interests and elites.It is incapable of reducing complexity and cost, and bailouts via borrowed money are stopgaps, not actual solutions.Decomplexificationis a mouthful, and everyone inside the machine knows the impossibility of paring organizational complexity. Everyone who is a stakeholder in the status quo (which is virtually every employee, manager, etc.) will fight to keep the status quo intact as is, for fear that any re-organization might imperil their livelihood or security. This is entirely understandable, of course.Modern life is inherently complex. Democracy is complex and cumbersome because having a bunch of stakeholders all competing for public resources and advocating for a bigger slice of the pie is inherently messy. There must be oversight and feedback to minimize the possibility of one clique gaining complete power.Long global supply chains are inherently complex. Managing ever-increasing regulations is inherently complex. And so on.When the money runs out or loses its purchasing power, all sorts of complexity that were previously viewed as essential crumble to dust.We're witnessing the early stages of this in real time in healthcare and education: overly complex and costly systems are breaking down not just from the challenges of the pandemic but because they're structurally incapable of adapting or evolving beyond pseudo-reforms and policy tweaks.As an illustration, consider the current overly complex way our healthcare system funds itself and a system in which customers pay cash for medical care: no insurance, minimal oversight auditing, etc. Regulations boil down to a requirement to publicly post prices for services and actually charge only the posted prices.In higher education, as per the model I outline in my book The Nearly Free University, the campus and its entire bureaucracy becomes superfluous. Classes, embedded apprenticeships and in-person workshops are organized online. The entire scheme of accrediting colleges is jettisoned in favor of accrediting each student.And so on. You can see the problem: eliminating unproductive, obsolete layers of costly complexity will eliminate millions of middle-class jobs that can't be replaced with new expansive bureaucracies.Yes, paying cash for healthcare and campus-less, mostly automated universities are oversimplifications. So where is the middle ground between current costly complexity and some \"new normal\" with half the costs and complexity? There's no way to accomplish this while retaining the payrolls, priorities, processes and structures of the existing systems.The point here is that when the money runs out or loses much of its purchasing power, overly costly complexity collapses whether we like it or not.Decoherence is an interesting word.In science,\"Decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system into the environment, since every system is loosely coupled with the energetic state of its surroundings.\"Decoherence refers to the loss of systemic coherence between narratives, values, processes and systems.Simply put, stuff no longer works right and it no longer makes sense.What worked in the past has been transformed by twosystemic drifts:1. Systems that evolved to function in a specific socio-political-economic context continued adding complexity and cost because debt-based funding was available, not because they were becoming more efficient or effective.2. The socio-political-economic context has changed and so the status quo systems are mal-adapted, i.e. obsolete.These two systemic drifts occur so slowly that we aren't even aware of the loss of coherenceunless we compare the current system to a previous set point or look at it from the perspective of starting from scratch: what would the most sustainable, lowest-energy consumption, most efficient and productive system look like if we designed it from scratch? It certainly wouldn't be the system we have now,The four Ds help us understand why the status quo is incapable of adapting / evolving fast enough and effectively enough to manage a controlled collapse to a much lower level of cost and complexity.The status quo can't even admit the need for a controlled collapse, much less manage it.We can add a fifth D: denial.The four Ds are already in motion and denial is only accelerating systemic decoherence.My new book is available!A Hacker's Teleology: Sharing the Wealth of Our Shrinking Planet[3]20% and 15% discounts end September 30(Kindle $7, print $17)Read excerpts of the book for free (PDF).[4]The Story Behind the Book and the Introduction[5].

That's a lot of D's...</p><p>When the money runs out or loses its purchasing power, all sorts of complexity that were previously viewed as essential crumble to dust. Four D's will define 2020-2025: derealization, denormalization, decomplexification and decoherence. That's a lot of D's. Let's take them one at a time. I use the word derealization to describe the inner disconnect between what we experience and what the propaganda / marketing complex we live in tells us we should be experiencing. Put another way: our lived experience is derealized (dismissed as not real) by official spin and propaganda. The current state of the economy is a good example. We see the real-world economy declining yet the officially approved narrative is that there's a V-shaped recovery underway because Big Tech stocks are hitting new highs. In other words, we don't need a real-world economy, all we need is a digital economy provided by Big Tech platforms. This is derealization at its finest: the everyday world you experience directly no longer matters; what matters is stock prices and various statistics that all paint a rosy picture. Meanwhile, the wealthiest class is fleeing soon-to-be-bankrupt cities. The wealthiest class has the means to buy the best advice and also has the most to lose, so I give their actions far more credence than official propaganda. I've sketched out my thesis on denormalization in The \"New Normal\" Is De-Normalization and Here's Why the \"Impossible\" Economic Collapse Is Unavoidable: This is why denormalization is an extinction event for much of our high-cost, high-complexity, heavily regulated economy. Subsidizing high costs doesn't stop the dominoes from falling, as subsidies are not a substitute for the virtuous cycle of re-investment. The Fed's project of lowering the cost of capital to zero doesn't generate this virtuous cycle; all it does is encourage socially useless speculative predation. Collapse isn't \"impossible,\" it's unavoidable. The basic idea is that all the structures of the \"normal\" economy only function at full capacity, as costs have moved higher, unproductive complexity has increased and our ability to pay these higher costs is based on ever-expanding debt. As a result, \"normal\" became extremely fragile and binary: it's either fully funded at full capacity or it collapses. The structures of everyday life (to use Braudel's apt phrase) are incapable of downsizing to 70% of their previous complexity and cost, much less 50%. There won't be any \"new normal\" because the system has become too rigid, ossified, over-regulated and controlled by entrenched interests and elites. It is incapable of reducing complexity and cost, and bailouts via borrowed money are stopgaps, not actual solutions. Decomplexification is a mouthful, and everyone inside the machine knows the impossibility of paring organizational complexity. Everyone who is a stakeholder in the status quo (which is virtually every employee, manager, etc.) will fight to keep the status quo intact as is, for fear that any re-organization might imperil their livelihood or security. This is entirely understandable, of course. Modern life is inherently complex. Democracy is complex and cumbersome because having a bunch of stakeholders all competing for public resources and advocating for a bigger slice of the pie is inherently messy. There must be oversight and feedback to minimize the possibility of one clique gaining complete power. Long global supply chains are inherently complex. Managing ever-increasing regulations is inherently complex. And so on. When the money runs out or loses its purchasing power, all sorts of complexity that were previously viewed as essential crumble to dust. We're witnessing the early stages of this in real time in healthcare and education: overly complex and costly systems are breaking down not just from the challenges of the pandemic but because they're structurally incapable of adapting or evolving beyond pseudo-reforms and policy tweaks. As an illustration, consider the current overly complex way our healthcare system funds itself and a system in which customers pay cash for medical care: no insurance, minimal oversight auditing, etc. Regulations boil down to a requirement to publicly post prices for services and actually charge only the posted prices. In higher education, as per the model I outline in my book The Nearly Free University, the campus and its entire bureaucracy becomes superfluous. Classes, embedded apprenticeships and in-person workshops are organized online. The entire scheme of accrediting colleges is jettisoned in favor of accrediting each student. And so on. You can see the problem: eliminating unproductive, obsolete layers of costly complexity will eliminate millions of middle-class jobs that can't be replaced with new expansive bureaucracies. Yes, paying cash for healthcare and campus-less, mostly automated universities are oversimplifications. So where is the middle ground between current costly complexity and some \"new normal\" with half the costs and complexity? There's no way to accomplish this while retaining the payrolls, priorities, processes and structures of the existing systems. The point here is that when the money runs out or loses much of its purchasing power, overly costly complexity collapses whether we like it or not. Decoherence is an interesting word. In science, \"Decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system into the environment, since every system is loosely coupled with the energetic state of its surroundings.\" Decoherence refers to the loss of systemic coherence between narratives, values, processes and systems. Simply put, stuff no longer works right and it no longer makes sense. What worked in the past has been transformed by two systemic drifts: 1. Systems that evolved to function in a specific socio-political-economic context continued adding complexity and cost because debt-based funding was available, not because they were becoming more efficient or effective. 2. The socio-political-economic context has changed and so the status quo systems are mal-adapted, i.e. obsolete. These two systemic drifts occur so slowly that we aren't even aware of the loss of coherence unless we compare the current system to a previous set point or look at it from the perspective of starting from scratch: what would the most sustainable, lowest-energy consumption, most efficient and productive system look like if we designed it from scratch? It certainly wouldn't be the system we have now, The four Ds help us understand why the status quo is incapable of adapting / evolving fast enough and effectively enough to manage a controlled collapse to a much lower level of cost and complexity. The status quo can't even admit the need for a controlled collapse, much less manage it. We can add a fifth D: denial. The four Ds are already in motion and denial is only accelerating systemic decoherence. My new book is available!

Katy Hubery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says strong product revenues and growth from its services division will help it beat forecasts. She expects the company to report revenue of $55.1bn, compared with $58.3bn in the second quarter of the year.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, is expected to avoid posting its first quarterly loss in five years on Thursday week despite earlier warnings over heavy spending, thanks to major gains in users of its one-day delivery service and cloud capabilities. Bezos had told investors in April that normally the company would \"expect to make some $4bn or more in operating profit\" in the second quarter.</p><p>Apple's 32pc surge in 2020 increased its market capitalisation to $1.61 trillion, while Amazon is at $1.49 trillion.

Regulators in Germany, France, and most recently the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), have also studied the companies.</p><p>They have done little to stop their rise, but Maurice Stucke, a former US Justice Department prosecutor now at the University of Tennessee, says that the investigations have all laid the groundwork for US prosecutions.</p><p>\"The French and German inquiries helped inform the CMA,\" he said. \"The CMA says its findings could help inform [others], so they're building a foundation on each other's work. The agencies don't have to recreate the wheel.\"</p><p>The US's hands-off approach is changing. The Department of Justice is expected to charge Google within weeks in a case expected to focus on its giant advertising business, which accounted for $135bn of the company's $161bn total revenues last year.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, America's other competition authority, is investigating Facebook's dominance of social media, estimated at 80pc of industry revenues. A joint probe by 48 of America's 50 states is also focused on the two companies.</p><p>The investigations are believed to have closely followed that of the CMA, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">which concluded last month that Facebook and Google \"are now protected by such strong incumbency advantages...</url> that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms\", and that remedies could include splitting the companies up.</p><p>America has a history of break-ups, most famously Standard Oil and the telecoms monopoly AT&amp;T. Similar measures against tech giants are not out of the question.</p><p>Google could be forced to spin off parts of a complex chain of businesses that allows it to dominate each stage of how adverts are bought, sold and placed online. \"Google has made the most of these opportunities... to engage in arbitrage and rent-seeking,\" says a report published by the Omidyar Network.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, could be forced to undo its takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp, an idea that has even been backed by one of its co-founders, Chris Hughes.</p><p>Amazon and Apple occupy a second tier of interest for regulators. \"We believe federal and state antitrust enforcers right now are more concerned about Google, and to some extent Facebook,\" researchers at Beacon Policy Advisors said in a note.</p><p>But scrutiny is growing. Cook has insisted that Apple's minority share of smartphone sales means it is not a monopoly, but the company's shift from relying on hardware sales to digital media such as apps, music and news increasingly puts it at odds with suppliers of those services.</p><p>Last week, Apple felt compelled to release a report defending the 30pc commission it charges developers for purchases made on its App Store.</p><p>Mark Thompson, the outgoing chief executive of the New York Times and former director general of the BBC, last month pulled the US newspaper's material from Apple News, the iPhone maker's news aggregation app. News publishers say Apple demands too much control over the presentation of their journalism and too great a share of subscription revenue in exchange for easier access to iPhone users.</p><p>\"It is entirely reasonable that authorities on both sides of the Atlantic should ask all the right questions about these gigantic companies,\" says Thompson, although he is wary that regulation risks making news publishers financially dependent on rules set by politicians. \"My blood really runs cold when I hear the future could be a kind of government-regulated subsidy from Silicon Valley companies into publishers.\"</p><p>Amazon also disputes claims it is a monopoly, saying last year it represented just 4pc of US retail sales. But sellers that rely on its website have alleged that it unfairly uses data about their sales to launch copycat products.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">Bezos's Washington grilling will be his first</url>. A feud with Donald Trump, stemming from his ownership of the Washington Post, means the world's richest man could face more heat than his rivals.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">Investigators will fear the possibility of the hearing descending into political theatre, instead of surgical questioning</url>. Republicans made a last-minute attempt to add Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, to the roster last week. His company is a minnow compared to the other four, but has been a target after recent decisions to censor Trump's tweets.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Pichai would prefer to play a different political game, one they believe could shield them from heavy-handed regulation. In recent months, Facebook and Google have said hurting them only aids the rise of China by letting its biggest internet companies grow without competition.</p><p>Stucke, the former prosecutor, says this is unlikely to be a winning strategy. \"There's always the argument that we need national champions to compete on a world stage. We've seen that before, and it fails.\"</p><p>If the four horsemen expect patriotism to protect them from being broken up, the hostile reception they are likely to face from Washington tomorrow might change their mind. After all, America's tobacco executives might have expected the same thing.</p><p>                       Additional reporting by Christopher Williams                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64712685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F7-1SR1-JCJY-G368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1427\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

With <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Brexit</url>approaching, an answer to that question feels more urgently needed than it has for some time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ask a hundred people and you might expect to encounter some recurring themes. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Democracy</url>perhaps? What about fairness? Liberalism, tolerance and humour might get a look in. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">stiff upper lip</url> might still be mentioned by a few, as might queueing. What about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">free speech</url>? We are, after all, a nation that apparently likes to speak its mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Freedom of speech can mean all sorts of things though. And concepts of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">safe spaces</url> and no-platforming have led many to question whether the right not to be offended has come to be a greater concern for many of us than the right of even those with deeply offensive views to express them.</p><p>The news media, inits many and varied guises, has often been regarded as the symbol of Britain's commitment to free expression. Elements of it may have been rambunctious but better that than being cowed - or, even worse, dull.</p><p>Social media's rise has made the role of the traditional media arguably less emblematic. Indeed, the more ardent critics of the now patronisingly acronymed \"MSM\" have sought to present it as merely part of the mysterious \"establishment\" - and not really independent, or free, at all.</p><p>Stephen Colbert buys billboard for Trump's 'Most Dishonest Corrupt Media Awards'</p><p>Nevertheless, it ought to be a matter of national shame that in this year's World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">the UK has fallen to number 40</url> in the global rankings, below the likes of Ghana, Lithuania, Uruguay and Jamaica. We are one of the worst performing countries in Western Europe.</p><p>Among other things, the fall takes into account proposals to replace the Official Secrets Act with new legislation that might see journalists penalised for obtaining leaked information; as well as threats from ministers to limit the use of encryption tools such as WhatsApp; and restrictions placed on journalists' access to political campaigns during the 2017 general election.</p><p>Read more</p><p>What influence will the media have over Brexit in the next year?</p><p>It should go without saying that the media must be accountable for its actions. There have been times in the past when some sections of the press failed to meet their ethical and legal responsibilities, as became clear during the Leveson inquiry and associated legal claims over phone hacking.</p><p>It's also true that journalists and editors sometimes make misjudgements and mistakes. Just today,</p><p>The Times</p><p> has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">rebuked over its story</url> of last year that alleged Tower Hamlets council had placed a Christian child with Muslim foster parents, to the child's detriment.</p><p>Yet the media continues to expose wrongdoing and to raise awareness of important issues daily - from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Windrush scandal</url> to antisemitism in the Labour Party; and from tax-avoidance schemes to widespread sexual abuse of children in towns such as Rotherham.</p><p>Thanks to changing consumer habits, and to the dominance of big tech firms, such as Facebook, much of the traditional media already faces significant challenges to existing business models. In many respects, it is rising to those challenges.</p><p>But as the Reporters Without Borders rankings show, press freedom is under pressure from a political discourse in which some of the loudest voices are antagonistic.</p><p>The Data Protection Bill currently going through parliament has been used by press critics as a vehicle to promote changes to the law thatcould have a further, serious impact on media organisations.</p><p>Aside from raising the spectre of another time-consuming, Leveson-style inquiry into the press's use of data (no mention of big tech's use of data, mind you), amendments introduced in the Lords seek to make publishers liable for picking up both sides' costs in any data protection cases brought against them - unless the publisher agrees to be regulated by a body approved by an official panel. Such measures are not only anathema to press freedom, but also to natural justice.</p><p>Read more</p><p>We need a Leveson-style inquiry into racist and sexist online abuse</p><p>Whether the amendments pass into the statute books depends on MPs. The Labour Party is committed to pushing for a Leveson-esque inquiry (despite the fact that the purpose of the bill is to update data protection laws in any event); many within the party's ranks also back the proposal to change the costs regime in privacy cases.</p><p>For those who have been on the receiving end of critical - and perhaps erroneous - media coverage, that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">attitude is perhaps understandable</url>.

But it is time politicians from all parties - as well as those who dismiss the \"mainstream media\" as a whole because they dislike the political standpoint of a particular newspaper, or because journalists sometimes err - understood the perils of the current, anti-media narrative.</p><p>As we begin to consider what vision of Britain might emerge after EU withdrawal, now is the time to remember that press freedom is something that is integral to democracy, not an easily dismissed afterthought.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-43417672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5X-VDG1-JCJY-G17G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><timeReceived>11:08 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 25, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Now, Democrats are demanding that big tech companies do something about it. Speaking at an event in New York City Monday, Hillary Clinton said[1] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 'should pay a price' for what he is doing to democracy.Her comments come as more Democrats argue[2] that Facebook shouldn't let President Trump, or any political candidate, get away with spreading falsehoods via political ads. </p><p>Almost every major Democratic presidential candidate has condemned[3] Facebook for its political advertising policy, while conservatives for the most part have endorsed it, or stayed quiet. Conservatives are instead focusing their political attacks on censorship, arguing[4] that Democrats and liberal firms are out to censor their speech to voters. Last week, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale ridiculed[5] Twitter's recent decision to ban political ads as \"yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives.\" It's an argument he's been using against companies for months. [6]Trump's campaign and key allies plan to make bias allegations by social platforms a core part of their 2020 strategy, officials told Axios in September[7]. Case in point: Donald Trump Jr.'s new book \u2014\"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us\" \u2014 is out today.The issue of hate speech has become another political flashpoint, with Democrats and Republicans sparring over whether their political perspectives are fair game online. Minority advocacy groups have pushed Facebook to ban[8] Trump's ads around immigration that use nativist undertones and false ads that allege two Muslim members of Congress are \"'anti-Israel, anti-AMERICAN, and pro-terrorist.\"Meanwhile, Democrats on the campaign trail are calling[9] for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, an internet provision that protects tech companies from liability for the content people post on their platform, to be reexamined. The big picture: A majority of Americans (73%) say voters in both parties 'cannot agree on the basic facts,\" according to Pew Research Center.[10] Disagreement over basic facts is making it easier for politicians to spew falsehoods without paying a price.And while news organizations scramble to fact-check these statements, it's proving difficult to do[11] in real time. Trust in mass media is also at a near all-time low[12]. Yes, but: Despite the onslaught of attention candidates and pundits are bringing to this issue, free speech and the First Amendment rarely come up[13] as highly important issues to voters amongst polls. The bottom line: The free speech debate is creating a hyper-polarized environment that candidates are exploiting ahead of the 2020 presidential election. It's also an entry point for politicians to talk about regulating Big Tech. Unlike with machine learning bias or anti-competitive behavior, the harm from lying in political ads is easy for voters to understand and legislators to act against.

As Britain's Parliament gets set to begin debating the Brexit deal, a victory for opponents of Prime Minister Theresa May. We're live in Westminster. And former US President George H.W. Bush is remembered for a life service and sacrifice as funeral details are revealed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with important developments in France after a weekend of serious unrest on the streets of Paris. The French government has suspended a planned hike in fuel tax for six months following weeks of protests and even some rioting. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe made the announcement today just a short while ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The original hike triggered demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest Movement, but protests spiraled on the attack on the government of Emmanuel Macron and is perceived indifference to inequality and the concerns of poor voters. The French Prime Minister says the government is taking measures to respond to those concerns. Our senior international correspondent, Jim Bittermann is in Paris. He joins us now and Jim, by putting this moratorium on fuel tax hikes, can the government restore calm?</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, that's the big question. And we've just been watching in the last hour or so since the Prime Minister spoke to the kind of reactions that we're hearing from the barricades and around France from the people who are part of this movement.</p><p>It does not appear that they are going to give up their calls for a protest on Saturday, but they're not as militant sounding as they were just a few hours ago. So it seems like the government has taken a step in the right direction and many of the \"gilet jaune\" say that, but they've first - a lot of them have other demands. We hear a lot of other demands out there. Things like a raise in pensions, a raise in the minimum wage, and all sorts of measures to take down the cost of living.</p><p>Now, what the government proposed according to the Prime Minister, it proposes the following things. First, a moratorium on those fuel taxes that caused the beginning of the movement in the first place. Now, if those fuel taxes never were actually put in place, but they were supposed to start in the first of January and that brought people out in the streets.</p><p>A moratorium for six months and during that six months, the government says they would like to have a debate on taxes that would be more efficient and more just. So that's something that some protesters can get their arms around. One that seems a little bit almost minor, and that is this change in the control of the - control technique which is the test that's given to motorists driving older cars. It was made more severe this year, which means it will be more costly for drivers to get their cars online and as a consequence, it does have some resonance amongst drivers, but it's a fairly minor kind of thing.</p><p>And the third measure was that tariffs for electricity and gas which normally go up in the first of January will be suspended for six months while they have consultations with the public about how much they should be raised. And certainly they won't be raised during the winter months. In any case, that's something that probably will affect the cost of living, as well.</p><p>So there are some concrete measures there, but of course, some people say it's too little too late. And one of the great Grench expressions we heard around here just after that was that we don't want them yet, we want the baguette, which means we don't want crumbs, we want the whole loaf, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Jim Bittermann monitoring the banners as well as the temperatures in the streets of Paris. Thank you, Jim.</p><p>Now, today, US President Donald Trump is expected to have a private visit with the family of George H.W. Bush. We'll show you live pictures right now as Americans continue to honor the 41st President. These are live pictures from the US Capitol where the former President is lying in state until Wednesday morning. His body will then be taken to the National Cathedral for a state funeral that will be followed by a funeral and burial in the former President's Home state of Texas on Thursday. Our CNN's Phil Mattingly joins us now live from Capitol Hill and Phil, George H.W. Bush now lying in state in the US Capitol. How will he be honored in the days ahead?</p><p>[08:05:05]</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, US CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: You know, Kristie, I think we saw the memorial service last night in the Capitol, kind of a who's who of the US government, both past and present. The Bush family also in attendance. The most interesting thing probably today is just the normal average Americans who will continue to file in. He will lie in state continuously. The Capitol will be open for anybody to come pay their respects until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. That's where he will be throughout the course of the day.</p><p>You mentioned the private meeting between President Trump and the Bush family in the Blair House which sits right across the street from the White House today. Last night, President Trump came in after the memorial service with the First Lady, stood silently for about two minutes, gave a crisp salute and then walked out.</p><p>Now, what is going to happen from here on out will also be something very significant, which honors the man and the government service that he led. At the National Cathedral, on Thursday, there will be a funeral in Washington. Those who will be in attendance will be kind of a who's who not just of domestic politics, but also international politics. President George W. Bush will eulogize his father. Also expected to speak, Senator Alan Simpson, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Jon Meacham, who kind of wrote the definitive biography of President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>Among those in attendance, every living US President, people like Prince Charles, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor is expected to fly to Washington, DC. It kind of something that underscores not just the importance, but also the relevance of the man not just in the United States but also across the globe.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, quite a number of people who will turn out there to honor his life. You know, his passing has led to this immense outpouring internationally of remembrances for him, his leadership, his life of service. Is it also providing a sort of respite from the vitriol and bitter partisanship we've seen in Washington in recent years?</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, I think to be frank, yes. It will be a brief respite, no question about it. The US is currently facing a government shutdown deadline which will likely be over the course of the next couple of weeks and obviously, it's no secret in the wake of the United States' midterm elections where things stand politically.</p><p>But I think the interesting moments yesterday where when you had Republican Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi come together, lay a wreath in front of the casket. Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican do the same representing the United States Senate. I think there was a recognition that kind of wherever the politics are now, and nobody thinks they're particularly good, but President Bush represented, at least the time he was in office and particularly in the time after office was something perhaps better than the way things are now.</p><p>Will people change because of that? I would say that's very unlikely based off what we've seen in the last couple of years, but at least for this moment, there's a recognition that perhaps there is a greater good here.</p><p>LU STOUT: Phil Mattingly reporting live from Washington, thank you. And the legacy of George H.W. Bush extends far beyond domestic issues in the US. Let's bring in CNN senior international correspondent Matthew Chance. He joins us live from Moscow. And Matthew, George H.W. Bush was US President for only one term. And yet, he had this enormous impact on foreign policy especially there in Europe, tell us more.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, that's right, Kristie. He presided over a momentous period in global geopolitics. The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 that was under the Bush presidency, as well as the disintegration of the Soviet Union a couple of years later in 1991.</p><p>These are all the momentous events that President Bush sort of oversaw, if you like, in his role as US President at that time. His counterparts over here in Moscow have been, you know, paying their respects, particularly foremost amongst them Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader issuing his deep condolences. Of course, to the family - to the Bush family - at this time saying that he has a lot of memories and statements about George Bush, Senior.</p><p>\"We had the chance to work together,\" he said, \"During the years of tremendous change. It was,\" he said, \"A dramatic time that demanded great responsibility from everyone. The results was an end to the Cold War and an end to the nuclear arms race,\" so quite a legacy there of that relationship according to Mikhail Gorbachev as he speaks about President Bush.</p><p>There have been some remarks as well coming from President Putin, the current leader of Russia. Remember, President Putin found out, like the rest of us, about this passing of President Bush just after a meeting with the current US President, Donald Trump had been canceled by President Trump via Twitter, who said he wasn't going to meet him after all in Buenos Aires.</p><p>But President Putin didn't mention that. He wrote a very informal letter to George W. Bush, President Bush's son, expressing, saying that his father expressed political wisdom and foresight, strove to make informal decisions, even in the most difficult situations and added this, \"He did a lot to strengthen Russian-American cooperation on issues of global security.\"</p><p>[08:10:01]</p><p>CHANCE: And so some have interpreted that as a slight side swipe at the failure of the current US President to engage with Moscow on those incredibly important issues.</p><p>LU STOUT: And if that is a slight side swipe, what are the lessons learned here? You know, Mr. Bush was known for his skillful diplomacy, especially during such a historic time. What are the lessons that his leadership offers to leaders today?</p><p>CHANCE: Well, it was a very difficult time and a turbulent time and a very sensitive one for Russians, as well because their empire, essentially, crumbled before their eyes in a very short period of time. And President Bush, Sr. went to great lengths to treat them as equals still and to sort of soften that blow, as it were.</p><p>I mean, met face-to-face with the Soviet leader who was outgoing and with Boris Yeltsin, the first Russian President to sort of formulate important arms reduction treaties, the START Treaty, Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was formulated under that first Bush administration. And I think there's a sense that, you know, there was a heightened degree of respect between the two capitals at that time and a sense of regret that that respect has deteriorated over subsequent administrations, with the Clintons, with Bush Jr., with Obama and now where we are with President Trump.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of nostalgia in Russia looking back to this period of sort of peak respect between the two countries during that Bush administration, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Matthew, really appreciate your analysis as we look back on that incredible archival footage on our screens. Matthew Chance live in Moscow. Take care. To Israel now which has just begun a major new operation along its border with Lebanon. Israel says it is working to, quote, \"Expose and thwart cross border attack tunnels,\" saying that they were dug by Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and military group backed by Iran. Oren Lieberman is at Israel's northern border and Oren, what more have you learned about the scope of this operation?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Kristie, you can see the very beginning of this operation here behind me along the wall that separates Israel from Lebanon. You can see what appears to be an earth mover, perhaps an excavator as well and some heavy machinery. That, Israel says, is the beginning of what it has called Operation Northern Shield.</p><p>Israel says shortly after the announcement of the operation, they identified and have begun to neutralize the first tunnel they have found that goes from that Lebanese village right over there, which is Kfar Kela to or towards Metula, a village in northern Israel. So that is the very beginning of this.</p><p>We've asked the idea of are there more tunnels? The Israeli military had said yes, there are more tunnels, but they're not being specific about how many more keeping that information to themselves, but they say this operation will continue as long as it is necessary to make sure all of those tunnels are identified and neutralized along the border between Israel and Lebanon, what is known as the blue line, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And Oren, what does this operation say about the current state of tensions between Israel and Hezbollah?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Kristie, there is no doubt that tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are high. They have been high and they will continue to be high, and yet over the last few months, over the last few years, even perhaps more than a decade now, what's been fired back and forth across this border is not artillery or gunfire, it's more rhetoric and even if that rhetoric has certainly ramped up in recent weeks and months for example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking a shot at Hezbollah in his UN General Assembly speech from a few months back, it is still just rhetoric.</p><p>So there is certainly tension now, but as you can see behind me here, even as this Israeli operation continues, there is no fighting that we see at this point.</p><p>LU STOUT: Oren Lieberman reporting live for us, thank you, Oren. Now a powerful voice in Silicon Valley is calling on the public to fight for privacy. Marc Benioff says he is not afraid to make enemies if it means fighting for what is right. His conversation with CNN's Laurie Segall just ahead. Plus, how Dubai is trading its youth as emerging tech threatens traditional jobs.</p><p>[08:15:10]</p><p>LU STOUT: A glittering Tuesday night here in Hong Kong. Welcome back. You are watching \"News Stream.\" Now, at a time when the tech industry is facing ever growing scrutiny over how it collects and uses personal data. One of Silicon Valley's most influential billionaires, Marc Benioff is calling on consumers to fundamentally change our view of privacy and fight to protect it. As the founder and co-CEO of Salesforce and recent owner of \"Time\" magazine, Benioff says he doesn't mind making enemies in Silicon Valley if it means fighting for what he thinks is right.</p><p>He sat down with CNN's Laurie Segall for her new series, \"The Human Code.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, CEO AND FOUNDER, SALESFORCE: When everyone and everything is connected, okay, you're going to have to really think about do you trust what is happening? Do you trust these companies and these products that are in your home and in your car and what's going on?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I mean, I've got to tell you, Marc, I don't 100%. Look at what's happened in the last couple of years. How can we put all our faith in big tech when in the last years, it doesn't even seem like some of these companies know the impact of their own algorithms?</p><p>BENIOFF: I think it's kind of the metaphor of the social networks is great actually. When they started, they're talking about it, it's nirvana, everything is wonderful, we're going to connect everybody together. Now, we find out they're not uniting us, they're dividing us. You know, that they're not maintaining our data, that they're selling it, that there isn't privacy, you know, that there's a - basically a huge ecosystem of people who are harvesting the data for personal gain.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you trust this industry to self-regulate?</p><p>BENIOFF: I don't trust the industry to self-regulate. I already said, Facebook is the new cigarettes. It's not good for you. It's addictive. You don't know who is trying to convince you to use it or misuse it. The government has to step in and regulate it. And Facebook has proven that to us over and over and over again, that they need to be regulated because they are not self-regulating. And that is true of a lot of technology companies.</p><p>Look, we have those examples in every industry. Why is technology going to be the only industry that the government isn't going to step in to make sure that there's fair practice and truth and trust with consumers or businesses?</p><p>SEGALL: Do you think that we fundamentally have to reshape our view of privacy?</p><p>BENIOFF: I think we have to fundamentally reshape our view of business. The business of business is not business, but the business of business is improving the state of the world. If you start from there, then you can answer your question which is of course we have to go much deeper on privacy. We have to have phenomenal privacy regulations.</p><p>Look at what - I'm a huge advocate and I've supported what just happened here in this great state of California where we have the best privacy law in the country. But why does Europe have a better privacy law with something that they have called GDPR than we do here? I've called for a national privacy law in the United States. We need a national privacy law. We can't just have it in California. Every company needs to be held to a new level of capability and privacy.</p><p>This is - we're in this new world. Why is our government not moving fast enough into that world?</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Wow, such a good interview. Facebook is the new cigarettes. He is right. He is so right. Laurie joins us now live from New York. Laurie, thank you for bringing that interview to us as you, of course know, Marc Benioff, he is royalty in Silicon Valley, and yet he is positioning himself as a sort of new moral authority in this industry in crisis. Do you think he's succeeding? Is he succeeding in forcing this rethink in tech about ethics and values?</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, you know, I will tell you from being kind of behind the scenes in Silicon Valley, you hear other founders kind of rumbling a little bit about Marc Benioff who is kind of going out to the press and he is talking more and he's almost campaigning for more ethics in tech.</p><p>[08:20:08]</p><p>SEGALL: And yes, I will tell you, he isn't exactly making friends out there, but I think he's making a huge impact. If you look, he was just campaigning for something called Prop C, which was a bill to help the homeless and it was a pretty controversial bill regarding for some different reasons. But it passed.</p><p>And you know, he is in a position because Salesforce is not under fire like Facebook, like Twitter, like many other tech companies like Uber and he's in a position where he can speak out and he is actually really beginning to.</p><p>He said something fascinating to me during the interview when we were talking about this idea of technology becoming more human. You know, we have tech in our homes that almost feels more human. Think about Alexa, other types of devices. And he said, you know, down the road, we have to think about - do we have the right to know if we're being contacted by a machine or a bot? Think about on Twitter if you're being spammed by someone, do you have the right to know if that is a real person or is that a machine? And he said there should be government regulations.</p><p>So he's really thinking ahead on that. That is not even something I think we were really thinking about. And you know, I think he's trying to have these conversations now and he certainly is not making friends along the way.</p><p>LU STOUT: He's a tech titan raising some really important issues. And earlier this year, he and his wife, they both announced that they were buying \"Time\" magazine. Bought it for $190 million. Why and how will the magazine change under Benioff?</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, I mean, I think when I asked him about this, he essentially said, what I think we're hearing from a lot of kind of tech CEOs who kind of go in and purchase media companies that he wanted to give them the opportunity to succeed, that this is a legacy brand, a media brand having trouble. And you know, I said to him is, \"Legacy for you? Is this ego? What is this?\" And he said he really wants to empower journalism. And I said to him, \"Well, look, as a journalist, and I have to ask you this question, what if \"Time\" magazine wants to write bad things about Marc Benioff?\" And he says, \"I want \"Time\" magazine to be unshackled,\" and you know, he wants to support journalism that is what he says is the reason for doing this. So we'll see. But they're going to have a lot more resources to do what they were doing before, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Such a refreshing new voice in tech. He's been out there for a while, but like he's getting more amplified, thanks to interviews like yours. Laurie Segall, thank you so much.</p><p>SEGALL: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT: Laurie's interview, it's part of her new series called \"The Human Code.\" She sits down with the most influential leaders in Silicon Valley who share their thoughts on where technology is headed and how it will change our lives and how we should push back.

And then it helps get graduates jobs. Our Samuel Burke now reports, all students need is an internet connection and a computer to begin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Egyptian Abdelrahman Nasser has just spent the last few months learning what many believe is the language of the future. The 14-year-old has learned computer coding thanks to a Dubai-led initiative called the One Million Arab Coders, a free online platform that offers Arabs from all over the world the chance to become computer literate and be software developers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ABDELRAHMAN NASSER, PARTICIPANT, ONE MILLION ARAB CODERS INITIATIVE: From my young age, I was always very inquisitive so I got interested in computer science on my own. But moving around isn't easy for me. When I heard about the One Million Arab Coders Initiative, it was great because I could work remotely. All I needed was a laptop and the internet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Over 2,000 miles away, Dubai coder Faisal Al Hawi is already putting what he learned into action, developing apps and software for small businesses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAISAL AL HAWI, CO-FOUNDER, CREATIVE AND SMART DIGITAL LLC: Coding is simply programming machines or telling machines what to do. You can do wonders, of course, with coding. It's a long journey. It does require dedication, but if you're doing it with passion like I am, I don't think you are going to struggle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Launched by the Dubai Future Foundation in October 2017, one of the initiative's goals is aimed at addressing a regional youth unemployment rate that is among the highest in the world. Once the coder graduates, the program also helps them connect with tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHALFAN BELHOUL, CEO, DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION: Yes, there are challenges around the world and I think the One Million Arab Coders has created a platform of hope for the people that either cannot have access to job opportunities or have a passion for coding that they cannot reach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: So far, 375,000 Arabs are learning to become computer coders. Mona Alwadi is among the top 26,000 who graduated so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MON ALWADI, GRADUATE, ONE MILLION ARAB CODERS INITIATIVE: Coding is like the soldier on the back end that creates is in front of you. We use this language to express ourselves instead of using other languages and with this language, actually, we can build a huge future for our countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:05]</p><p>BURKE: With disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain predicted to cost hundreds of thousands of more traditional jobs, Dubai is helping arab youth adopt and adapt to the future. Samuel Burke, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: We're going to take you to Britain next where five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit plan will begin in the next few hours. And the British Prime Minister, she is facing an uphill battle to get lawmakers on board.</p><p>And a consequence of Brexit you might not have considered, why some of Europe's migrants are desperate to get into the UK.</p><p>I'm Kristi Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines. The French government has suspended planned increases in fuel tax for six months, the country's Prime Minister has announced. In recent weeks, protests against high fuel prices have often led to violence it broadened into an attack on the government of Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>The Israeli army says it has identified a cross border tunnel from Lebanon into Israel and is trying to neutralize it. It is part of a new operation designed to quote, \"thwart cross border attack tunnels.\" Israel says that they were dug by Hezbollah, the political and military group backed by Iran. The Hezbollah press office says it has no comment regarding the operation.</p><p>US President Donald Trump is expected to meet privately with the family of George H.W. Bush after paying his respects last night at the US Capitol. A state funeral will be held for the former US President tomorrow before he is buried next to his wife in Texas on Thursday.</p><p>Kiev says Russia has partially unblocked Ukraine's ports on the Azov Sea. It is allowing ship traffic to resume through the Kerch Strait. In that confrontation last week, Russia attacked and captured three Ukrainian ships and detained 24 service members. In a statement, a Ukrainian Minister expressed hope that the next step will be the release of those sailors.</p><p>To Britain now where Prime Minister Theresa May will kick off five days of debate on her Brexit plan in the coming hours before lawmakers vote on December the 11th. A vote she looks increasingly likely to lose.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Court of Justice has issued an opinion that Article 50 can be revoked unilaterally. That was a provision that allows a country to withdraw from the bloc. The UK had said it could only stop Brexit if the other 27 EU countries agreed. A spokesman for Theresa May says the UK will not revoke Article 50.</p><p>[08:30:04]</p><p>LU STOUT: Bianca Nobilo, joins me now from outside the Houses of Parliament, and Bianca, again Theresa May, she is set to open this historic debate on Brexit, and yet she is facing challenges on multiple fronts.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: As she has been for the last year and a half. But she has even more obstacles today than she had yesterday. Not only is she kicking off these five days of debate about her Brexit deal which she looks incredibly sort of unlikely to pass. I think as each day goes by, more and more MPs come out against the deal. Over 90 of her own MPs have come out saying they are not going to support it.</p><p>The opposition party, the Labour Party have come out to say that they're not supporting the deal as well as the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Democratic Unionist Party. So on that basis, she definitely doesn't have the numbers to get this through. And not only does she have that pressing task ahead of her, but today there's actually a debate happening in Parliament about whether or not the government has acted in contempt of Parliament.</p><p>Now, that's quite complicated, but it revolves around the government trying to withhold the full legal advice about Brexit from Parliament. And if that's proven to be true, the Prime Minister could be in even more trouble because it could mean potentially the suspension of one of her Cabinet ministers.</p><p>LU STOUT: So much at stake and then we have, as you referred to just now, EU lawyers saying that Britain can unilaterally stop the Brexit process. This is just a statement, it's just an opinion, but is it giving a lot more fuel to the anti-Brexit campaigners?</p><p>NOBILO: Of course. I mean, it's these types of opportunities that those who want to stop Brexit will have a second referendum are looking for, so of course it emboldens those who want to see Brexit stopped.</p><p>In fact, one of these Scottish members of the European Parliament that pushed for this ruling said today it's illuminated the sort of escape sign if you like, above Theresa May's deal. It's giving them the opportunity to stop the clock on Brexit. That's how he phrased it. So that's another problem for the Prime Minister.</p><p>However, I would caution that it's not legally binding and it would require the approval of European judges, and actually the European Commission and the British Parliament have both said that this isn't how it would work, that Britain couldn't withdraw its unilaterally and they disagree with this opinion. But it has given great heart to the people that want to see Brexit stopped.</p><p>And in fact even just behind me is a sign of how fractious the atmosphere is becoming in the UK. There's been a bus driving past Parliament campaigning to go leave the European Union. I think it might be going past me now and then in front of that are campaigners that want to remain in the EU waving their EU flags and having standoffs with each other.</p><p>So the atmosphere is just becoming more and more tense as we reach this critical juncture where really, if the Prime Minister can't pass her Brexit deal, then all bets are off and we don't know what would happen. It could look like a second referendum, an extension of Article 50 or it could be a no deal. Really, nobody can say.</p><p>LU STOUT: We'll have to wait and see. December 11th, Bianca Nobilo, reporting live. Thank you. Now, British lawmakers, they might be struggling to go make up their minds on Brexit, but there is one group of people who already have. They're not British. In fact, they're not in the UK at all right now. But as far as they are concerned, Brexit could literally have life changing implications and not for the better. Melissa Bell has more on the refugees desperately rushing to the UK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, PARIS CORRESPONDENT, CNN: A three -year-old with her family rescued from the icy waters of the channel. Over the last month, more than a hundred migrants have made it to the United Kingdom aboard dinghies. Ahmed wasn't so lucky. After two failed attempts at crossing on a dinghy, he is back in the woods of Northern France, woods that he calls the jungle. He tells us that the risk is worth it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AHMED, IRANIAN MIGRANT: Not controlled. You can go to England to two hours, three hours, if you have a strong motor, you can go.</p><p>BELL But there are big ships, there are waves, there are currents. It's very dangerous. You could die in the water.</p><p>AHMED: Yes. But die is better than life in the jungle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Ahmed left more than two years ago, and fellow Iranians have been arriving in greater and greater numbers according to aid workers speaking of economic hardship and political persecution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HADI, IRANIAN MIGRANT: The rules in Iran is not the same in Europe. The rules is the same, but they don't accept the rules. Whatever they want, they do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: They tell us that asylum will be easier to get in the United Kingdom and official figures show that Iranians do have a relatively good chance of receiving asylum on the other side of the channel.</p><p>[08:35:04]</p><p>BELL: The trouble is getting there and soon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HADI: You know, the New Years, the UK leaves the Europe and the thought is everything is going to be hard and no one can go to UK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: And they say there's the difficulty of the cost. People smugglers charge migrants thousands of euros to help them get on to trucks. Hence, the desperate attempt to find other ways across the water. The French Coast Guard has redoubled its patrols and now says it is rescuing migrants every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRID PARROT, SPOKESWOMAN, FRENCH COAST GUARD: So these people, when we find them, they are in the state of hypothermia and also, they are just so frightened because we thought that they saw death. We don't want to have cops on the beach or to have a collision with a big boat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: This is the part of the French coast that is the closest to England. From here, you can see the cliffs of Dover. It's over 17 nautical miles across. And so it is from these beaches, from this part of the coast that the migrants set off in whatever they can find. In fishing boats, in dinghies, and sometimes even in kayaks.</p><p>Miraculously, some do make it across. Peter Wallace is a local councilor in Dover.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER WALLACE, COUNCILOR, DOVER: Before the camps, people were trying to get through to the tunnels or in the back of lorries, but it's been this huge change in the last month. Over a hundred people, including tiny little children have been trying to get across the whole channel in tiny little boats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Which has become a daily struggle for the French and English Coast Guards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you need help?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay. Help is coming. We've called for help.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: And however desperate this image, these are the lucky ones, rescued from English waters. Waters so cold that no one could survive them for more than an hour. Melissa Bell, CNN, Calais.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: You're watching \"News Stream\" and still to come right here on the program, blockchain is a technology that was cast into the spotlight, all thanks to Bitcoin, but it has far wider uses than cryptocurrencies. In Brooklyn, one startup is using the power of blockchain to let neighbors trade energy among themselves. That story is next.</p><p>Live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" Now, the concept of blockchain, it has taken the world by storm and one New York start-up is now leveraging this technology to disrupt the energy sector. Enter Brooklyn Microgrid. It's a network that allows community members to produce, store and trade energy locally.</p><p>Here is Matt Rivers with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW RIVERS, INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Imagine a shared economy innovation like Airbnb or Uber for the utility sector that can shift energy generation away from remote power stations into the hands of the community.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARRY GOLDEN, BROOKLYN MICROGRID MEMBER: About three years ago, our family with along with 11 other neighbors purchased rooftop solar for our houses. So we were at that point starting to produce more energy than we consumed and that's when I discovered the Brooklyn Microgrid and their vision for the future of more localized energy system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:40:06]</p><p>RIVERS: Garry Golden is part of a developing community powered energy platform which could eventually enable more than 100 homes in his neighborhood to share electricity with one another.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE ORSINI, CEO LO3 ENERGY: So the way the Brooklyn Microgrid works is here in Brooklyn, we've got a lot of community members that really want to buy energy from people that are producing it here in the community.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: LO3 CEO, Lawrence Orsini is the man behind one of the world's first peer to peer energy trade initiatives using blockchain technology. Usually associated with Bitcoin, blockchain technology is used for verifying and recording transactions and is now being leveraged for trading in renewable energy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ORSINI: So I can actually put panels on my roof. I can produce my own electricity. So what that does is that shifts economically the way that we get to participate on an energy grid. Now, it's not just one way anymore. It's me participating in this market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: There are some challenges users have to sign up, set up some hardware in an app and there could be Federal regulation down the road. Traditionally, energy has come from a large, central station and flowed in one direction. The Brooklyn Microgrid allows power to be generated and distributed locally which they say could take stress off the grid.</p><p>And with New York's ambitious plan to power 50% of the city with renewable energy by 2030, locally produced clean energy coming from homes like Golden's might help that transformation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL D'AURIZIO, INVESTMENT MANAGER, CENTRICA: I think what's really important about this transformation underway in the electric system is as much as it's a technology story, what doesn't get talked about a lot is it's also a human story. That has a human impact on how people interact with and think about energy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: And this mentality shift is happening globally with similar initiatives taking place from Australia to Germany proving that blockchain technology is about more than just Bitcoin.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Wow. A fantastic application of the technology there. Now, finally, from September of next year, these devices, the ones that once filled offices in Japan with beeps and buzzes, they will all fall silent. Tokyo Telemessage is ending the final pager service in Japan due the lack of demand. These devices, they were deeply popular all around the world, especially in the 1990s, but the mobile phone revolution has rendered them effectively obsolete. Tokyo Telemessage had 1.2 million subscribers in 1996, but now fewer than 1,800 people use them. Farewell, pager. But as for the fax, that vintage tech, that one is going to still stick around.

Even a French police union now calling on its own police union members to join the nationwide protest and military deployed. The rest of Europe on edge and watching. We're on it.</p><p>Republicans calling on former FBI director James Comey to testify again after he testified today on the Hill behind closed doors. Comey just now commenting before, \"I cannot believe we are still talking about the Hillary Clinton e-mails.\" Even though it was James Comey who held uncalled for two press conferences about it.

Money, politics, we got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. Let's get right to Fox News reporter Greg Palkot. He's in Paris as France prepares for more violent protests nationwide. Greg?</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS REPORTER: The Eiffel Tower behind is just one of many landmarks which will be shut down tomorrow as Paris braces for trouble. As we travel through the city today, we saw operating (Ph) being taken away. Stores and restaurants shutdown as well.</p><p>Some 89,000 police will be deployed nationwide to try to minimize the damage that we saw last week here. Authorities they expect significant violence, they say their mobilization is total. It's all part of the so- called yellow vest protest that started as a protest against the rise in tax on gasoline and diesel fuel and is turned into a broader populist action against high taxes and low wages.</p><p>And a government thought to be out of touch with the people, that's the government of French President Emmanuel Macron. He came in reforming, but again, he is thought to be distant from the people and that's why they are upset. And it is spreading.</p><p>This week we saw protests of students concerned about changes in their curriculum. Images of kids being lined up outside of high school by the police has stoked popular opinion here and outrage as well.</p><p>Officials say this protest been hijacked by militants on the left and the right, but that is what is getting attention. Protest leaders met with the French Prime Minister tonight. They are talking but they want to hear from French President Macron. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Greg Palkot in Paris, France there. Thank you so much, Greg. The French protest a big wake-up call scaring all of Europe. Again, as Greg reported, what began as protests over increased fuel taxes grew wildly out of control into a working-class riot even after President Macron cancel those tax hikes. Now it's about rising cost of living, declining way of life, under flatlining economic growth and double-digit joblessness.</p><p>Let's get to Steve Hilton. He's host of the Fox News show The Next Revolution, it's a great show. Steve, what a story. Reports of tax offices in France firebomb, and all police units nationwide mobilize. Your thoughts here.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, really the phrase that comes to my mind looking at all this, especially in relation to Macron person is, pride comes before a full because he's been going around over for the last year or more, in going around in such an arrogant manner talking about how he's going to rule -- he actually said this, like Jupiter above the fray, above the mere mortals with the rest of politics.</p><p>And he's just been so arrogant and treated working French people with such contempt, cut taxes for the wealthiest, increase taxes for working people. When they brought their concerns, and even we're going back a year or so now when unemployed workers were protesting. He'd say, well, they should stop making a false and go and look for work.</p><p>More recently with the gas tax protest he said well, why can't they carpool, instead. He just behaves to such contempt towards what we here in America would call the forgotten men and women that President Trump spoke for. President Macron is almost speaking against them, and so this is -- this is payback time it seems to me.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: And it's a real humiliation because he said that he will be the first French president who would not buckle in the face of street protests. It happened to every single president in modern French history and its turn out just the same with him.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Now reports indicate his government is in trouble. The global condemnation of France -- French police rounding up high school teenage students forced to kneel in the mud, still wearing their school backpacks really lit up and stoke the protests over there.</p><p>Again, the bad economy in France. Let's get to it. It is a socialist economy. Their GDP has been flatlining. Jobless rates it basically a double digit, whereas, here in the U.S. is pretty good. Your take on that, Steve Hilton.</p><p>HILTON: Well, this is exactly why in a way this is such a tragedy. Because the French economy it's so overladen with regulation. It's very bureaucratic. This is what previous presidents have tried to do to try and boost that sluggish economy with the kind of reforms that actually to be fair, Macron was talking about.</p><p>And this particular battle over the fuel taxes was something that would not in any way have helped to address those weaknesses in the French economy. And so, the real tragedy of this is because of this particular fight his whole reform program, much of which actually would've been very good for France's economy--</p><p>MACDONALD: Understood.</p><p>HILTON: -- it looks like it's in jeopardy.</p><p>MACDONALD: But you know, there is a bureaucratic state there that's really hard to get around.</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: His approval rating crashing to the 18, 20, 23 percent range. And to your point the OECD that group over there, the think tank over in Europe says France has the highest, is the highest tax nation in any country over there. Your take on that.</p><p>HILTON: That's exactly right. And it's the taxes, it's the difficulty in starting a business, it's the difficulty in hiring people, and especially in firing people. All this is really off putting to entrepreneurs and investors and that's why France in many areas is lagging behind. And there's a particular problem with youth unemployment that's always been really, really high and stubbornly high in France.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: And we've got -- but we've got low.</p><p>HILTON: And--</p><p>MACDONALD: But we've got low youth unemploy -- I joblessness here. You know, the thing is, Steve, you said this before. You don't see a European Silicon Valley. You don't see the vibrant economy over there as you have it here. Do you think Europe is seeing this as a wake-up call? Are they watching this on edge?</p><p>HILTON: I don't -- I don't think they will. This is the terrible problem I think, is that they won't see the real lesson in here. If you look at their economic contrast what's prompted that economic boom that we've seen here with President Trump. It's been his economic policy agenda. It's been tax cuts, and especially the deregulation. Getting rid of those regulations to stand in the way of entrepreneurs and business people.</p><p>And every time that conversation in Europe goes to say, don't we have Silicon Valley, why don't we have this great economic success story, their answer is always more bureaucracy, more top-down, centralized state intervention. From the E.U., for example, they say let's have an E.U. project.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: So, they literally at one point said, let's have an E.U. version of Google that we will build. That's the craziest stuff so you can imagine.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILTON: So, I don't think they'll learn the right lesson. They never do.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying. Let's get to the outrage in China over the arrest of that Huawei chief financial officer. Steve, do you think the media jumped the gun here saying that this was too much of an aggressive push by the Trump administration.</p><p>Because she was arrested in Canada now charged with sanctions fraud for telling banks that Huawei had no connections with a company called SkyCom that was doing business with Iran when SkyCom is a unit of Huawei, a company she helps run.</p><p>And even Canada's Justin Trudeau says her arrest was not politically motivated. Your take on this, Steve.</p><p>HILTON: I think that's correct. I think it's really important that this happened. It's a good thing that we're taking this action against China's - - this is just the latest example of China's breaches of international good practice and it's happening all over the economy, and also to different sectors. They're breaking rules everywhere</p><p>And in fact, I think this kind of response is in a way better than a blunt tariff-based response because this target is the really bad behavior directly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But it's about fraud.</p><p>HILTON: You got the state-owned enterprises.</p><p>MACDONALD: This is about fraud. This is about deceit, right?</p><p>HILTON: Yes. But it's connected to the sanctions busting in relation to Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>HILTON: And it's yet another example of how the Chinese government through these either state owned enterprises or basically state-controlled enterprises are behaving like rogue actors in the global economy. And we've got to stand up to them and be really tough. So, I think this is a really good move.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve Hilton, great to see. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>HILTON: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: And be sure to catch Steve Helton show on Fox News, the Next Revolution, Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Breaking news tonight. Federal prosecutors in New York calling for Michael Cohen to serve roughly years in prison and pay a $100,000 fine. Cohen pleaded guilty last week to lying to Congress about an abandoned plan to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow. There is much more there. We are going to bring in Bill McCurn -- McGurn of the Wall Street Journal later in the show to talk about it.</p><p>Cohen also says he talked multiple times to Donald Trump about reaching out to the Russian government. There's evidence apparently that Cohen says it indicated that Russia tried to reach out to Trump as early as 2015. We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>President Trump will nominate President George H.W. Bush's Attorney General William Barr as his next attorney general to replace Jeff Sessions. President Trump saying today that Bars was my first choice since day one.</p><p>And President Trump also will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the new U.N. ambassador, replacing Nikki Haley. Trump describing Heather Nauert as a very talented, very smart, very quick person.</p><p>We're also monitoring reports that the White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly may be stepping down.</p><p>Let's get to your money. The Dow down triple digits more than 500 points today, ending at 24,388. The S&amp;P sticking a 2633, basically down 4.5 percent for the week. Now the Dow and the S&amp;P erased 2018 gains over fears over that trade fight with China and rising interest rates.</p><p>The Fed now taking a wait-and-see approach on whether to hike rates this month.</p><p>Trump tweeting talks with China are going well despite the arrest of the CFO of China's Huawei for sanctions fraud.</p><p>Let's get to your jobs report. Falling short of expectations for November, 155,000 jobs created versus 198,000 jobs predicted.</p><p>Let's get to national gas prices dropping to an average of $2.44 versus for regular. Gas prices down 58 days straight. OPEC and Russia agreeing to bigger than expected cuts to production. Oil prices jumping to $53.75. We're going to be tracking gas prices for you.</p><p>Next up, Democrat socialist Alexandria Cortez said the U.S. should nationalize Tesla because taxpayers deserve a return on that investment. We're going to debate that and how the government is losing money big time and other industries it has nationalized.</p><p>And secret Facebook documents published in the U.K. now have a former top British spy chief saying, guess what, Facebook is a threat to democracy. We're going to debate that next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. Special counsel Robert Mueller filing a sentencing document on one-time Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. The headline, he lied about contacts with the Trump administration officials in a Russian associate. We are going to have more coming up on this and also Michael Cohen.</p><p>Let's get to this story for you. Google CEO Sundar Pichai set to testify before the House next week about allegations of anti-conservative bias in its search results, and likely will face a grilling over how it collects and users -- uses your data without you knowing it, as well as its work on a censored search engine for China.</p><p>This, after the U.K. Parliament published secret Facebook documents and e- mails by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Former British spy chief Robert Hannigan he now says Facebook is a threat to democracy unless it is controlled and regulated.</p><p>Joining me now from the Daily Caller is Amber Athey. Great to see you, Amber.</p><p>AMBER ATHEY, REPORTER, DAILY CALLER: Thanks for having me, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: First, your reaction to the spy chief Robert Hannigan. He said more, Amber. Let me give it to you. He said Facebook is not, quote, \"a fluffy charity trying to connect the world as it tries to say but is a hardheaded tech company squeezing every drop of profit from your user data without telling you about it.\" Go ahead.</p><p>ATHEY: Well, he's not wrong. We've seen over the past couple of years we've been learning more and more information about how Facebook has been harvesting user data and actually selling it to third parties without user consent or in cases where the users are misled into giving up their personal information.</p><p>It's a serious problem that people have to be aware of. And I'm looking forward to hearing more of, especially from a Google as well which as much of the same thing to hear how they are going to remedy this issue and be more transparent moving forward.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here's what Facebook is accused of and it keeps getting worse as the revelations come in. It's accused of giving outside companies records of our text and phone calls of who we're calling, and also our Facebook messages on the Facebook site. So that's at issue.</p><p>There's really zero privacy. We didn't know that Facebook was basically going into our android devices and picking up records of who we're calling and texting and then selling that information potentially. What do you think of this?</p><p>ATHEY: Right. It's really terrifying to think that Facebook is reading private text messages that you have with friends and family.</p><p>MACDONALD: Not reading. Forgive me, Amber. Forgive me, I'm so sorry. Let me back up. Reading the Face -- the messages on the Facebook.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ATHEY: The Facebook messages?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Go ahead.</p><p>ATHEY: Yes. Even so, it's still obviously really jarring for people to learn about this. I think there's always been that hint of suspicion that Facebook knows more than its lead on. And it's not this happy social media network that just wants you to enjoy your freedom of speech with your friends and plan events.</p><p>They have to get something out of this. And it turns out what they've been getting out of it is private user information that they've been able to make a quick buck off of.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. It's amazing. I mean, they're trolling through your phone records and your text records. Nobody knew that on android devices. And you know what's going too at Facebook, Amber, I'd like your reaction to this.</p><p>New reports coming in that a growing sense of paranoia at Facebook has workers using disposable phones so they can trash talk the company or talk about the company with their colleagues without Facebook finding out about that. I mean, that shows how bad it is inside Facebook if those reports are true. Your take on that.</p><p>ATHEY: Exactly. And can you really blame the employees for wanting to get out from under the people at Facebook who have been mining user's private data, especially considering the aggressive response that Facebook has. So, anyone who criticizes them as we learned with Sheryl Sandberg's messages just a couple of weeks ago and her work would define her as looking to undermine anyone who criticizes Facebook.</p><p>But, look, Liz, this is reflected in Facebook stick and in big tech stocks across the board. Their stocks have been plummeting recently because people are beginning wise to the underhanded tactics that the social media companies are using. In addition to, of course, the awful bias against conservatives. They are paying the price for this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, to your point, about 93 mutual funds have dumped their shares in Facebook. Based -- that means that's the end of the road the thinking is on Wall Street. We'll see it, though. Amber Athey, great to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>ATHEY: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to more headlines for you. Amazon reportedly looking to expand its cashier-less go locations to airports. Reuters reports that Amazon talk with officials at LAX and San Jose international Airport about potentially launching go stores to sell concessions.</p><p>New details emerging from the bail hearing in Canada for the CFO of Huawei. Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou over sanctions fraud allegations specifically that she fraudulently hid from banks Huawei's control of a company called SkyCom that was doing business with Iran despite the sanctions.</p><p>A Canadian prosecutor alleges that Meng said there was no link between Huawei and SkyCom. SkyCom, apparently, is a unit of Huawei.</p><p>And check out this video from the criminal trial of the infamous drug lord El Chapo. The jury watched a video of the U.S. Coast Guard intercepting El Chapo's cocaine packed submarine. The coast guard found 13,000 pounds of cocaine worth 100 million bucks on the street. Look at that footages. Just amazing stuff.</p><p>Three whistleblowers have come forward to House Republicans with hundreds of pages of evidence of potential pay-to-play at the Clinton Foundation. A House hearing set for next week on the status of that Justice Department investigation into it. We are going to give you the details and new details that Bill Clinton allegedly may have used that Clinton Foundation as his personal piggy bank.</p><p>Next up, Bernie Sanders pushing Medicare for all. But he's using misleading poll numbers to suggest that Americans, more Americans are for it without saying that poll numbers plummet when you call it what it really is, single-payer run by the government. We're going to debate the latest Bernie Sanders fastball with by voters. That's next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: We got breaking news. President Trump just now tweeting, quote, \"totally clears the president. Thank you.\" Now, we got to figure out what that means, we're going to stay on that story for you.</p><p>Tonight, we've got the news coming in on Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and James Comey. Trump could be talking about any one of these men. We're going to bring more on that later in the show.</p><p>Bernie Sanders whipping a fastball by Stephen Colbert on the late show last night. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D) VERMONT: A few years ago, when we said that healthcare is a right, not a privilege and that we should create a Medicare for all single-payer system, I was sold. I'm crazy. It's extreme, I'm a fringe guy.</p><p>Seventy percent of the American people in the last polls that I've seen now support Medicare for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. That's one poll that use the term Medicare for all. However, the poll numbers drop dramatically when people are instead asked, do you support single-payer. The Washington Post Kaiser family foundation poll says 53 percent of Americans support single-payer, 43 percent oppose it. That's a lot different from 70 percent in support.</p><p>Joining me now Fox News contributor, Deneen Borelli, and Democrat strategist, Nathan Rubin. Great to see you, guys.</p><p>NATHAN RUBIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Liz.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Deneen, even Democrats in California and Vermont rejected single-payer, fearing it would bankrupt the state. Colorado too rejected it, saying it's going to bankrupt the state. Doctors and hospital staff say it's single-payer, it will collapse the healthcare industry. Your thoughts on that.</p><p>BORELLI: Yes. Well, they would be the ones to know the reality of what Bernie Sanders is trying to sell. Listen, any time the words of free, people should pause and take note because nothing is free. There are input costs for goods and services and Americans are not stupid.</p><p>So, what you don't want is for the government to be involved to control really your healthcare needs and services, because when the cost skyrocket what they're going to do is rationalized healthcare, so they would be picking and choosing how and when you should get coverage and by who.</p><p>MACDONALD: Nathan, I've talked to brain surgeons. I've talked to breast cancer surgeons. I've talked to nurses. They all say single-payer would be the worst thing to hit this country. We understand we want to take care of the poor, absolutely, and get them the care they need.</p><p>They keep saying this is not the way to do it to have the government control your healthcare. It would wipe -- the Sanders bill would wipe out existing insurance when we placed everything across the board we would be reporting to the government. Your take on this.</p><p>RUBIN: Well, I certainly think that it's a delicate issue. And the numbers that you've presented there I think it indicates that healthcare policy is complicated. If you look at the numbers of support for the Affordable Care Act those are going to be different from Obamacare when people are asked, even though they are the same bill. So I think the nomenclature that we use is complicated number one, but also --</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, how about just saying the truth that it is single-payer and it's government-run health care. I think people are basically they get fast balls with buy them if you call it a nice soft name like Medicare for all, it it's not that. It will replace all insurance across the country, employer insurance, any insurance you have got. Go ahead.</p><p>RUBIN: Well I think what people are coming to terms with is that the idea basically that if you or a loved one gets sick you shouldn't have to go bankrupt to get them the treatment that they need.</p><p>MACDONALD: Got it. Understood.</p><p>RUBIN: So whether that's a single-payer system or Medicare for all system, I don't know the specifics of what Bernie Sanders is introducing in his bill, but I think that value, that understanding is starting to resonate with the American people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Understood. And Deneen, people in the health care system say that the cost is so high because the government already dominates half of the health care industry and half their time, majority time they are doing paperwork and not treating patients. Your take on this.</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, sure, and that's going to come down to what kind of service that you get as well. When you have the likes of Bernie Sanders trying to push this saying that is free, what they are doing is misleading Americans. They are putting them, you know, on the wrong page and they're not really presenting the facts to them.</p><p>So, I think it's really important for folks to realize and recognize what Bernie Sanders and those who are in support of single-payer what this really boils down to. And it's going to comes down to the government, the bureaucrats picking and choosing for you and your family how and when you should get coverage or services from doctors and hospitals.</p><p>MACDONALD: Deneen and Nathan, thank you so much. We are going to see you again in just a bit. Coming up next, we got jam packed rest of the show for you. Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, both on the hot seat, both being charged with lying and much more. And that's the latest word tonight from federal prosecutors. We got Bill McGurn on the details, next.</p><p>Plus, the evidence against the Clinton Foundation now mounting. Three whistleblowers came forward to the House with hundreds of pages of evidence potentially showing pay-to-play there and also Bill Clinton allegedly using the foundation for his own personal expenses. Bill McGurn will talk to us about that as well. He joins me next, stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to more details, breaking news about Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Fox News Leland Vittert is in D.C. with the latest. Leland.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Liz. We'll start with Paul Manafort here. And this is how the government is alleging that Manafort broke his plea agreement with the special counsel's office. They alleged that he lied not only about his contacts with administration officials saying he didn't tell the special counsel's office when he was talking to members of the administration.</p><p>He lied about his discussions with a Russian political consultant, lied about a wire transfer and information related to another DOJ investigation. Now, specifically what those lies were and how in the words of the government, they are discernible lies. We don't know because so much of it is blacked out.</p><p>For example, after being told of such evidence, Manafort conceded that he and this Russian political operative discussed or may have discussed blank at each meeting. So, therein lies the difficulty of trying to figure out exactly what they are accusing Manafort of lying about. But the government saying they don't need to abide by the plea agreement anymore.</p><p>Next were the issue of Michael Cohen, the government conceding that Michael Cohen, in one time the president's attorney and fixer, did provide a lot of help to the government. This coming from the special counsel's office detailing Cohen's cooperation with the government. The defendant's assistance has been useful and for significant respects.</p><p>First, the defendant provided information about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign and discussion with others in the course of making those contacts. It also notes in a footnote that Cohen says he talked multiple times to Donald Trump about reaching out to the Russian government. That being the key connection now of what we are learning out of the Cohen plea agreement.</p><p>Note worthy, Liz, that this all started about a couple of weeks ago. We got the first look at the Mike Flynn plea agreement. He was the national security adviser to Donald Trump who then flipped and pled guilty and Robert Mueller has had extensive interactions with Flynn in discussions. You might remember that the special counsel's office said that they thought Flynn had cooperated so much and been so helpful that he should not have any prison time at all.</p><p>That is not what they are saying about Michael Cohen and obviously, it's obviously not what they are saying about Paul Manafort who they said not only should he go to jail but he has lied to them and therefore they want to rip up his plea agreement, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Leland Vittert, thank you so much for coming. I appreciate it sir. Great reporting there. For his reaction let's get to \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board member Bill McGurn. Bill, let's lay it out quickly. Here's what we know right now. Let's get first to Cohen. Mueller says Cohen indicated that Russia tried to reach Trump and his side of the aisle, Trump's side of the aisle, as early 2015.</p><p>Now we get to Manafort. Manafort had interaction with a Russian associate. That Russian associate had ties to the Russian military and that Russian military unit was hacking the Democrats. So, it looks like on the one side of it, it's Cohen that's talking about the Trump Tower in Moscow and the Manafort side of it is showing up at Trump Tower to talk about, you know, access to dirt on Hillary and the Democrats.</p><p>BILL MCGURN, EDITORIAL BOARD, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right. Look, every couple of months it looks like we get new information that implies without definitely proving that Trump worked with the Russians to affect the election. I'm old-fashioned. With the special counsel, I still believe that it should be in pursuit of a crime.</p><p>The crime is not talking. You can talk to that. You can even do sleazy things, take dirt from them, right? That's not a crime. The crime would be if he said to the Russians, OK, I work with you, help you. You hack them --</p><p>MACDONALD: I'll pay you to hack them.</p><p>MCGURN: -- you turn over. Well, just in any kind of cooperation. We are a long ways from that. You know, a lot of teasing kind of things. Look, Michael Cohen obviously has been blabbing now and so forth and the special counsel still isn't happy with him because he doesn't seem to be getting what he really wants.</p><p>Now, do I think Trump is in trouble? I don't think he's in trouble on the Russia front. I do think with Michael Cohen, the payments to Stormy Daniels may be considered a campaign violation. He could possibly be impeached for that. I mean, that's up to Congress to determine what that is. It be hard to prove in court I think as we found in history.</p><p>So, I think we have a lot of details to fill in and it seems after all these months of investigation, we should sort of be coming to an end. And again, the issue that he was set to investigate was Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Donald Trump conspired with the Russians to do that.</p><p>MACDONALD: But then he was given a broader (inaudible), right?</p><p>MCGURN: Yes and we are talking about deals. I mean, it might be another thing if the deal actually came through, but you know, with all these enticements, why didn't Donald Trump go ahead with the deal?</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to more news of the day. James Comey gets groped behind closed doors by House Republicans. Comey, not forthcoming, even saying we are talking about the Hillary Clinton e-mails again? He complained about that. I mean, didn't he held two press conferences about this.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes, I mean look, James Comey got off lightly this week. If you look at his filing to quash the subpoena from the House, the idea that he could dictate the terms. He wanted to talk in public for two reasons I think. One, it's easier to say I can't answer that because of national security, but also what Congress wanted him to do was to give a deposition.</p><p>In a public hearing, the members get five minutes. It's a little -- a lot of grandstanding. You can dodge the question. The deposition kind of keeps going until they run out of questions.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. I want to get to the Clinton foundation because this looks like quite a case. The Justice Department probe.</p><p>MCGURN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Three whistleblowers, hundreds of pages of evidence alleging that there was pay-to-play and that Bill Clinton used it as his personal piggy bank. Your take on this.</p><p>MCGURN: Come on, look at it. The FBI investigation was so corrupt of Hillary Clinton. The deals that they made. The memo that Rod Rosenstein wrote for why James Comey should be fired still holds up today. It was outrageous for him to give that press conference that he gave (inaudible). I mean, the other thing is he violated all the procedures. And again, James Comey wants one set of rules for everyone else and one set of rules for himself. It's just incredible.</p><p>MACDONALD: What about the Clinton Foundation? What is your take on that? is the justice (inaudible) is going to be hearing next week on it.</p><p>MCGURN: Well, we will see. It's a little late now I think.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why are republicans just doing all of this now?</p><p>MCGURN: Well, I think in terms of Comey -- Mr. Comey -- they had interviewed 16 other FBI agents and DOJ. They have got a lot of testimony, a lot of documents. They waited until the end to talk to the director because they have a lot more information than they had. He hasn't testified since last year.</p><p>MACDONALD: Bill McGurnm, we're going to have you in hopefully next week to break it all down again. You're great. Terrific stuff. Coming up, let's get to what's going was going on at the border. It looks like Mexico has really realized that problems with that caravan are out of control. They are not liking it. We got fresh new details on that. We will get reaction from the panel as well.</p><p>But first, Democrats now say hey, let's delay talk of a border wall funding mechanism until September of 2019. Breaking news too, apprehensions at the border soaring to an all-time high. We will get to the bottom of all of that with former ICE acting director Tom Homan. He is with us next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. We've got breaking news. Border apprehensions spiking to record highs. A 25 percent jump from fiscal 2017. That is happening now. A 25% jump. President Trump is preparing to meet with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer over what Pelosi calls in an immoral border wall. Let's bring in former ICE acting director Tom Homan. Good to see you sir.</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTIOR: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now the Democrats are saying, you know what, let's delay the talk about funding for the border wall until 2019. Republicans say let's give Trump $25 billion. There's quite a split here sir. Your take.</p><p>HOMAN: Well, this is, you know, I'm not surprised, but it's ridiculous. People like Nancy Pelosi, you know, they don't want to put a border wall up to keep illegal aliens out of the country, but she supports sanctuary cities and sanctuary state of California to keep them in. I mean, I've said it a hundred times. I don't care if you are Republican or Democrat.</p><p>What's the downside of securing our border? It means less illegal immigration and less drugs. What is the downside? There is none. So her number one responsibility as elected representative is to protect this nation and protect the U.S. citizens and she's failing to do so because she is putting her own political hatred against this president over protecting America which is her responsibility.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Charles Schumer was for border securities, you know, 2013 and earlier. Go ahead.</p><p>HOMAN: Yes. Schumer voted for border barrier back in 2006security. What has changed? President Trump is there. Look, they do not want to give this president a win. That's what it comes down to. Their sole hatred of this president and his policies over public safety and national security. It is terrible that they are doing this.</p><p>MACDONALD: And here's the other news breaking at Latin America, now has the world's highest murder rate. Your take on that.</p><p>HOMAN: Well look, Latin America is not a perfect place to live and certainly not as great as the United States. And I've said it many times. Look, I can't blame anybody for wanting to come to this great country. It's the greatest country on earth, but there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's the point.</p><p>HOMAN: And you can't -- want to be a part of the greatest country on earth and not respect its laws. Not under this president. And I think he is right on this. We are a nation of laws. We have a right to protect our borders.</p><p>MACDONALD: And ICE officials keep saying sanctuary cities are a present and real public safety threat. Your word on that.</p><p>HOMAN: Well, I've been fighting sanctuary cities in two years. Sanctuary cities are a danger to the public. To knowing release a public threat back into the public is just, is wrong. It's stupid. Now when we can take these people or any country and legally remove them, not only from the community but from the country.</p><p>And we got (inaudible) they're protecting immigrant communities by creating sanctuary cities. No, because the criminal aliens you release from jail are going to victimize the very communities they live in, which is the immigrant community and now that ICE cannot arrest that bad guy in a county jail. Now we got to go to the neighborhood to arrest that bad guy where they will find others who weren't in on the radar.</p><p>So sanctuary cities do not protect immigrant communities. They put them at greater risk of ICE arrest. They put them at greater risk of crime. Now, at the same time sanctuary cities entice more people to come to this country and that bankrolls the very criminal organizations that have killed border patrol agents and ICE agents and the cash that flow to the cartels and cartels charge fees to work (inaudible). This is just terrible. There's no good reason for sanctuary cities. None.</p><p>MACDONALD: Tom Homan, great to see you sir. Come back soon.</p><p>HOMAN: Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up after the break, the massive economic cost of illegal immigration. We're staying on more news from that. It's beyond lost jobs. We are going to debate it, next.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's stay on the breaking news about Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. We're going to bring back the panel, Deneen Borelli and Nathan Rubin. Deneen, first to you. Cohen is indicating evidently that, you know, Russia tried to reach Trump as early as 2015. And the news on the Manafort side is that Manafort lied about his interactions with a Russian associate who had ties in the Russian military, the unit that was hacking the Democrats. Your take on all of this, Deneen.</p><p>BORELLI: Yes. My head is spinning, Liz, trying to keep up with all of the information that continues to come out over both of these individuals. But I got to tell you, when it comes to this entire thing, the investigation with the special counsel, Robert Mueller, this has been going on for what, over two years now.</p><p>The money, time and resources that had been involved in this and we still don't really have any concrete answers in terms to the initial charges or questions which was Russian collusion with President Trump or his campaign people. So, you know, what is the bottomline here? What are the answers and will we ever really find out the truth to what's going on?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, Nathan, that's the point. As of this moment, when you look through what's going on today, Nathan, no proof that President Trump or, you know, basically worked with the Russians to hack into the Democrats. I mean there is no evidence of that right now. That's why the president is tweeting out, apparently, I'm in the clear. Thank you.</p><p>RUBIN: We'll, you're both absolutely right, that there is no hard proof yet, but that's why the investigation is ongoing. What we do know is that over the course of this investigation, a number of people very close to the president have been indicted or pled guilty.</p><p>That's National security advisor Michael Flynn, that's his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, his former foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. A number of people are being indicted and or pleading guilty. So while we don't have any proof yet, we are starting to see some of the results of the investigation come in.</p><p>MACDONALD: Deneen, the smoke around, you know, Michael Cohen saying that Moscow Trump Tower project had no guarantees. It did not go forward. That reportedly that was used as leverage by the Russians over Trump. Your take on that.</p><p>BORELLI: Yes. Again, I am trying to diligently follow all of this because I do have to talk about this on a regular basis and some of the information is just now coming out. But I got to tell you, my concern is how I think Americans are being misled here, Liz. And it's really unfortunate.</p><p>Also, it's like they are trying to find a crime and then they will try to figure out all the other back end of it. And, you know, it's like they are being proven innocents before they are proven guilty. So I tell you, my head is spinning with all of this. I'm sure Americans are as well. But I hope they get to the bottom of this so that we really know what's going on.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you think Nathan, we're going to get to the bottom of it soon or no?</p><p>RUBIN: Why I hope so. I mean, I don't think any of us really know what Robert Mueller knows and those working in that investigation. But at the end of the day, you know, as the president loves to say, we are a nation of law and order.</p><p>And the fact that Robert Mueller is bringing charges against people who have violated the law, I think is a really important fact that we need to remind the American people of.</p><p>MACDONALD: The campaign finance implications of paying hush money, that's the issue, right? That's coming out too, Deneen, today, of hush money to President Trump's paramours. Your take on that.</p><p>BORELLI: Yes, that is one of the thing that I read about, Liz, and again, this is still breaking for me. I wish I could really comment more on this, but as time goes on I'm sure we will get to the bottom of all of the details.</p><p>And I think it's just really unfortunate the country has been held up for two years over Russian collusion and we still do not have any concrete findings or evidence of that with President Trump or with his campaign personnel.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, \"vanity fair\" coming out with a piece, this is it, that's it? Nathan, it's all you got? I mean, of course, that predates what we heard today. But you know, I mean, Nathan, it's been 20 months and still no charges on that front.</p><p>RUBIN: You are absolutely right that no charges have been brought against the president, but we are starting to see a fuller picture come into play. So, I would caution that we should let this continue to play out and I think with a Democratic House, they're going to protect Bob Mueller's investigation as much as they can. I don't think this is political in nature. I do think he's trying to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Quick final word Deneen and then we got to got.</p><p>BORELLI: Well the news has been dominating Russian collusion for ever and ever and we still do not see any proof of that.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Deneen and Nathan, thank you so much for your time there for covering that breaking news. And thank you for having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good weekend.</p><p>President Macron Is Nowhere To Be Seen After People's Anger Erupted Over His Decision To Raise Fuel Taxes; President Trump's Former Lawyer Michael Cohen Could Potentially Face Four Years In Jail And Pay A $100,000 Fine;

There is a lot of time at the beginning of a session when the lobbyists and legislators simply stand around and shoot the bull in an effort to get to know each other. In one instance there were several lobbyists talking with members of the Butte and Anaconda delegations - Democrats all. </p><p>As the conversation went on the Butte delegation became more and more boisterous about their view of politics' culminating in one of the members saying something to the effect about the business lobbyists: 'Yea, we eat their food, drink their whiskey and sleep with their women. And in the morning we vote against them.'We all laughed uproariously. But in short order you learned that was precisely what they did. They were always the first hog to the trough whether it was for a free lunch, a round of drinks or a campaign contribution. They were great company but they would vote against you at the drop of a hat. And the business community learned little from that anecdote. They continued to pour money into Butte/Anaconda Democrats and were routinely rewarded with bupkes. When I came back to Oregon in the 90's a different form of 'business interest derangement' was played out by the Democrats. The Senate Majority Leader Kate Brown (D-Portland) (now Governor) led a charm offensive with personal visits to the business leaders in Oregon - primarily in Portland. Her message was that the business leaders shouldn't believe that Democrats were anti-business and that they really had the same priorities as the local business community - better schools, a robust workforce, efficient government, etc. - and they wanted to do all of that within the existing revenue structure. (What those words really meant were that the Democrats wanted higher salaries for the teachers unions, an increased number of public employees, more money to fund PERS and government that put itself before its constituents.) Ms. Brown, despite a reputation for vindictiveness, can be quite charming in a casual meeting and she was able to convince any number of the leaders of the business community to donate to the Democrat senate campaign committees. (Of course, it wasn't that big a job given the history of the Portland based business associations who annually gathered to determine their legislative agenda which somehow always managed to be precisely the Democrat governors' legislative agenda.) And the reward was one tax increase after another; one regulation after another, one carbon tax after another, one resistance to growth after another led by the Democrats. And yet they continue in the vain hope that something will change - and it never does. So it wasn't a surprise to read the March 9th edition of the Wall Street Journal and find an article about the United States Senate's resident scold, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), declaring that if she is elected president that she will seek to break up the technology sectors major players - Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. There she was in her pastel linen jacket, bent forward, finger wagging, lecturing those attending that someone was too big, or too rich, or too successful and, therefore, evil. The Journal quoted her as saying: ''Today's big tech companies have too much power- too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,' Ms. Warren said in an online post. 'They've bulldozed the competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else.'' But where was Ms. Warren when these companies were growing, absorbing competitors, capturing every last bit of information both from their users and the purchase of similar information from third parties, and papering Democrats in Congress with millions of dollars in campaign contributions? Well, that's a good question. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and the Silicon banditry are all reliable Democrats - not just Democrats but exclusionary liberal/progressives. These companies, primarily through their executives and employees have dumped millions of dollars in reportable campaign contributions to Democrats near and far. And they have provided forums for Democrats, lent expertise to candidates to provide them access to social media. And did we hear a peep out of Ms. Warren then? Nope. Her new found outrage is as contrived as her claim of Native American ancestry or her opening and drinking a beer in pre-campaign video. The Journal noted: 'Ms. Warren's proposal also marked a shot across the bow at another Democrat vying for the 2020 nomination, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, home to the powerful Bay Area tech companies.' And don't forget that one of the most consistent Democrat contributors, Howard Schultz or Starbucks fame, gave generously to even Ms. Warren only to be vilified by the Democrats for the temerity of considering running for president. (You just cannot take anything these politicians say at face value. You have to expect that it has more to do with the election and less to do with any serious concern for the citizenry - particularly when you are dealing with a world class phony like Ms. Warren.) But be that as it may, these instances described above are repeated time and time again on a state and national basis by the governing elite of the Democrat Party. (Laying this on the backs of the working class Democrats is a bit unfair given that most of them are searching for a party that represents their interests as much as conservatives like me are searching for one that represents our interests- this could become a kumbaya movement.) It is a constant reminder of the tale of the Frog and the Scorpion. And if you are a businessperson contributing to these scorpions, rest assured your time is coming - like the scorpions, it's just what they do. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-ORCA111081155248385728725176490000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORCA-111081</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-1K01-DXKX-0222-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>The Oregon Catalyst</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gov.

There is a lot of time at the beginning of a session when the lobbyists and legislators simply stand around and shoot the bull in an effort to get to know each other. In one instance there were several lobbyists talking with members of the Butte and Anaconda delegations - Democrats all. </p><p>As the conversation went on the Butte delegation became more and more boisterous about their view of politics' culminating in one of the members saying something to the effect about the business lobbyists: 'Yea, we eat their food, drink their whiskey and sleep with their women. And in the morning we vote against them.'We all laughed uproariously. But in short order you learned that was precisely what they did. They were always the first hog to the trough whether it was for a free lunch, a round of drinks or a campaign contribution. They were great company but they would vote against you at the drop of a hat. And the business community learned little from that anecdote. They continued to pour money into Butte/Anaconda Democrats and were routinely rewarded with bupkes. When I came back to Oregon in the 90's a different form of 'business interest derangement' was played out by the Democrats. The Senate Majority Leader Kate Brown (D-Portland) (now Governor) led a charm offensive with personal visits to the business leaders in Oregon - primarily in Portland. Her message was that the business leaders shouldn't believe that Democrats were anti-business and that they really had the same priorities as the local business community - better schools, a robust workforce, efficient government, etc. - and they wanted to do all of that within the existing revenue structure. (What those words really meant were that the Democrats wanted higher salaries for the teachers unions, an increased number of public employees, more money to fund PERS and government that put itself before its constituents.) Ms. Brown, despite a reputation for vindictiveness, can be quite charming in a casual meeting and she was able to convince any number of the leaders of the business community to donate to the Democrat senate campaign committees. (Of course, it wasn't that big a job given the history of the Portland based business associations who annually gathered to determine their legislative agenda which somehow always managed to be precisely the Democrat governors' legislative agenda.) And the reward was one tax increase after another; one regulation after another, one carbon tax after another, one resistance to growth after another led by the Democrats. And yet they continue in the vain hope that something will change - and it never does. So it wasn't a surprise to read the March 9th edition of the Wall Street Journal and find an article about the United States Senate's resident scold, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), declaring that if she is elected president that she will seek to break up the technology sectors major players - Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. There she was in her pastel linen jacket, bent forward, finger wagging, lecturing those attending that someone was too big, or too rich, or too successful and, therefore, evil. The Journal quoted her as saying: ''Today's big tech companies have too much power- too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,' Ms. Warren said in an online post. 'They've bulldozed the competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else.'' But where was Ms. Warren when these companies were growing, absorbing competitors, capturing every last bit of information both from their users and the purchase of similar information from third parties, and papering Democrats in Congress with millions of dollars in campaign contributions? Well, that's a good question. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and the Silicon banditry are all reliable Democrats - not just Democrats but exclusionary liberal/progressives. These companies, primarily through their executives and employees have dumped millions of dollars in reportable campaign contributions to Democrats near and far. And they have provided forums for Democrats, lent expertise to candidates to provide them access to social media. And did we hear a peep out of Ms. Warren then? Nope. Her new found outrage is as contrived as her claim of Native American ancestry or her opening and drinking a beer in pre-campaign video. The Journal noted: 'Ms. Warren's proposal also marked a shot across the bow at another Democrat vying for the 2020 nomination, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, home to the powerful Bay Area tech companies.' And don't forget that one of the most consistent Democrat contributors, Howard Schultz or Starbucks fame, gave generously to even Ms. Warren only to be vilified by the Democrats for the temerity of considering running for president. (You just cannot take anything these politicians say at face value. You have to expect that it has more to do with the election and less to do with any serious concern for the citizenry - particularly when you are dealing with a world class phony like Ms. Warren.) But be that as it may, these instances described above are repeated time and time again on a state and national basis by the governing elite of the Democrat Party. (Laying this on the backs of the working class Democrats is a bit unfair given that most of them are searching for a party that represents their interests as much as conservatives like me are searching for one that represents our interests- this could become a kumbaya movement.) It is a constant reminder of the tale of the Frog and the Scorpion. And if you are a businessperson contributing to these scorpions, rest assured your time is coming - like the scorpions, it's just what they do. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ORCA111081155248385728725176490000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORCA-111081</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-3NN1-JCMN-Y08N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Oregon Catalyst</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gov.

Amazon is still facing allegations that one of its executives misled Congress about that same issue last year.</p><p>The virtual testimony comes at a time of rising legal jeopardy for the major tech companies, who are the subject of antitrust and consumer-protection probes in Washington, multiple U.S. states and Europe.</p><p>Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) set the tone early, with an opening statement vowing to check the power of the \"emperors of the online economy.\" But so did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the full Judiciary panel, who laid out a long series of alleged slights against conservatives by top social media companies - and later got into a shouting match after a Democrat accused him of promoting \"fringe conspiracy theories.\"</p><p>See live highlights from the hearing below.</p><p>6:30 P.M.Amazon seller fees increasing because of greater use of services, Bezos says</p><p>Amazon is making more money from sellers fees because more third-party sellers are using its services, CEO Jeff Bezos told lawmakers, countering the idea that his company is unfairly profiting from the merchants.</p><p>But the Amazon CEO acknowledged that the marketplace algorithm may \"indirectly\" favor those who pay the company to fulfill orders.</p><p>Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) cited a new report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance that found Amazon brought in nearly $60 billion from seller fees last year - 21 percent of Amazon's total revenue - and that the e-commerce giant keeps about 30 percent of each sale. That amount is up from 19 percent of each sale five years ago.</p><p>Bezos said the increased amount is because sellers are spending more money with Amazon by using additional services such as Fulfillment by Amazon, where the company stores and ships products on behalf of third-party sellers.</p><p>\"When you see these fees going up, sellers are choosing to use more of our services we make available,\" he said. \"Previously they were shipping their own products from their own fulfillment centers so they would have had costs doing that. ... Now they are doing that through Fulfilment by Amazon.\"</p><p>Bezos also acknowledged that the Buy Box - which preselects the seller for when a user clicks on a product - \"indirectly\" favors sellers who use the Fulfilled by Amazon services.</p><p>\"Indirectly, I think the Buy Box does favor products that can be shipped with Prime,\" he said. \"The Buy Box is trying to pick the offer that we predict the customer would most like. That includes price, that includes delivery speed, and if you're a Prime member, it includes whether the item is eligible for Prime.\"</p><p>In response to questions from Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ill.) about stolen and counterfeit goods, Bezos said he believes that Amazon requires sellers to provide a real name and address, but wasn't sure whether a phone number is required. He also said he didn't know how many resources Amazon devotes to seller verification.</p><p>6:04 P.M.Jeff Bezos: Social media a 'nuance destruction machine'</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took a rare swipe against a core feature of his Silicon Valley competitors late in today's hearing, singling out social media as destructive for free expression.</p><p>\"What I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a 'nuance destruction machine,'\" Bezos said. \"And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy.\"</p><p>Bezos offered his critique while testifying by videoconference, alongside the head of social media giant Facebook.</p><p>He was responding to House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who was invoking the idea of \"cancel culture\" and the notion of online mobs that shout down unfashionable opinions. The lawmaker was assessing whether lawmakers were concerned about the polarizing idea, which some question as overblown.</p><p>\"I am concerned in general about that,\" Bezos told Jordan.</p><p>Other tech CEOs also appeared sympathetic to Jordan's cancel culture worries.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook noted he wasn't \"all the way up to speed\" on the idea but expressed concern: \"If you're about where somebody with a different point of view talks, and they're 'canceled,' I don't think that's good. I think it's good for people to hear from different points of view and decide for themselves.\"</p><p>\"I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country that are pushing against free expression,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Jordan, without identifying specifics.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai simply noted the interest in building platforms to allow freedom of expression. - John Hendel</p><p>5:41 P.M.Tech CEOs demur on China, except Facebook's Zuckerberg</p><p>The Chinese government steals U.S. technologies, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said - making him the only one of the four tech CEOs willing to say that plainly in response to a question from Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.).</p><p>\"I think it's well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook said he had no personal knowledge about Chinese technology theft.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai initially followed Cook's line, but later corrected the record to confirm that in 2009 China stole Google information in a \"well-publicized\" cyberattack.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who answered last, acknowledged that he had read \"many reports\" about technology theft by Beijing, but had no first-hand experience beyond knock-off products sold on Amazon.</p><p>All four CEOs passed on the opportunity to suggest how Congress could better help defend U.S. companies abroad, against either technology theft or excessive regulation.- Leah Nylen and Ryan Heath</p><p>5:22 p.m. Cicilline to Zuckerberg: 'You can't contain deadly content' </p><p>Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House's probe into tech giants, accused Facebook of tolerating a fountain of misinformation that benefits the company's engagement-driven business model - even on topics as deadly as the coronavirus. </p><p>\"There's no competition forcing you to police your own platform,\" the House antitrust subcommittee chairman told CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"During the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime, don't you agree that these articles viewed by millions on your platform will cost lives?\"</p><p>The lawmaker cited articles that drew millions of views on sites like Facebook while making claims about Covid-19, including those describing President Donald Trump's musings about placing disinfectants inside the body or allegations that coronavirus \"hype\" is a political hoax. </p><p>Cicilline said Facebook allows such content to reap advertising dollars. But Zuckerberg countered that this kind of noxious material is not \"helpful for our business.\"</p><p>\"It is not what people want to see, and we rank what we show in Feed based on what is going to be most meaningful to people and what is going to create long-term satisfaction,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of taking down bogus information that could cause imminent harm and its attempt to highlight authoritative guidance. But Cicilline brought up a Monday video from the conservative website Breitbart, which dismissed the necessity of masks and called hydroxychloroquine a Covid-19 cure - and which experienced soaring Facebook traffic over several hours before Facebook removed it. </p><p>\"A lot of people shared that,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we did take it down because it violates our policies.\"</p><p>\"After 20 million people saw it after a period of five hours?\" Cicilline countered. \"Doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?\" - John Hendel</p><p>4:57 P.M.Cook: Apple wasn't trying to protect its own app when it removed competitors</p><p>Apple didn't consider the impact on its own parental control app when it removed some of the most popular apps that limit screentime from its App Store, CEO Tim Cook told lawmakers.</p><p>Apple introduced its own Screen Time app, which allows parents to limit how much time kids spend on their phones, in September 2018. After that, the company removed a number of competing apps. Qustodio and Kidslox, two of the leading parental control apps, have filed a complaint with the European Commission about their removal.</p><p>Cook said Apple removed the apps because of privacy concerns.</p><p>\"We were worried about the safety of kids,\" Cook said in response to questions by Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.).</p><p>Demings asked Cook why the company removed many of the most popular screentime apps but not Absher, an app created by the Saudi Arabian government that uses the same technology. </p><p>\"It sounds like you applied different rules to the same apps,\" Demings said.</p><p>Cook said he wasn't familiar with Absher, but said the App Store has about 30 parental control apps after it changed its policy last year. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who returned to the issue later in the hearing, noted that Apple eventually allowed the apps back into the App Store after six months without requiring major changes.</p><p>\"We apply the rules to all developers equally,\" Cook said. \"I see Screen Time as just an alternative. There's vibrant competition for parental controls out there.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>3:55 P.M. Zuckerberg denies threatening rivals</p><p>Facebook has \"certainly adapted features\" from competing services, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday, but he denied it has threatened to copy start-ups if they wouldn't sell to his company.</p><p>But Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) expressed skepticism about his answer, reading from text messages between Zuckerberg and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and messages between Systrom and a venture capitalist. She asked Zuckerberg whether he \"threatened\" Systrom and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel by saying he would clone their products if they didn't sell to Facebook. The company bought Instagram in 2012, but Snap rebuffed offers to sell to the social network. </p><p>The House subcommittee also posted those documents to its website Wednesday.</p><p>\"I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten,'\" Zuckerberg said, referring to the company's effort to build an app called Facebook Camera. \"It was public we were building a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing.</p><p>\"It was clear this was a space we were going to compete in one way or another,\" he said. \"I don't think those are a threat in any way.\"</p><p>Jayapal reminded Zuckerberg he was under oath while testifying.</p><p>In closing her questioning, Jayapal said she didn't believe threats should be a normal business practice. </p><p>\"Facebook is a case study in monopoly power, in my opinion, because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on your competitors and copy, acquire and kill rivals,\" she said. \"You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and ensure you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance.\" - Leah Nylen</p><p>3:44 P.M. Sensenbrenner: No need for Congress to change antitrust law </p><p>House Judiciary Democrats lost a big potential GOP ally if they had any hopes of bipartisan recommendations to update antitrust law as part of their probe into tech giants. </p><p>\"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, said hours into the hearing on alleged bad behavior by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. \"They've been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.\"</p><p>The subcommittee's probe has been led by Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who has been preparing a report to conclude the long investigation. GOP buy-in would strongly bolster its conclusions, including potential recommendations for updates to antitrust law.</p><p>Notably, Sensenbrenner seemed to support the probe itself and said he's \"been working with the chairman for over a year on this bipartisan investigation.\" His support runs counter to some Republicans who have disparaged Democratic handling of the probe. </p><p>But Congress shouldn't toss out a century of precedent, added the retiring House Republican. He said lawmakers should instead pressure antitrust regulators like the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has faced accusations of going lightly on companies like Facebook and Google.  - John Hendel</p><p>3:20 p.m. 'Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!'</p><p>Tempers flared more than two hours into the hearing after Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-Pa.) began her questioning with a dismissal of what she called \"fringe conspiracy theories\" of House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).</p><p>That prompted an outburst from Jordan, who had just pressed Google on whether it's biased toward Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and said he had internal evidence of the search giant's interest in encouraging Latino voters in 2016. </p><p>The only problem: It was no longer Jordan's time to speak, as Democrats immediately reminded him as they shouted him down.</p><p>\"Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!\" antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) declared amid gavel slamming. </p><p>When someone told him to wear a mask, Jordan sought to bring up the \"unmasking\" - in the surveillance sense - of former Trump White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. </p><p>\"When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond,\" Jordan said before letting the hearing proceed. </p><p>For the record, Google CEO Sundar Pichai maintained that his company is apolitical. - John Hendel</p><p>2:56 P.M.Bezos doesn't totally resolve questions on misleading Amazon testimony</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is still investigating whether employees may have used data it acquires from its third-party sellers to launch competing products - an issue that has prompted allegations that the company misled House lawmakers a year ago.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,\" Bezos said in response to questions from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district includes Amazon headquarters. \"If we found someone violated the policy, we would take action against them.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Amazon employees frequently looked at seller data to help determine what products the company should offer, contrary to what an Amazon executive told the House a year ago. Jayapal also quoted a former Amazon employee as telling the panel that seller data is \"a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want.\"</p><p>Bezos also acknowledged that while company policy might prevent employees from looking at a specific seller's information, they could look at aggregate data. Jayapal and The Wall Street Journal story noted that Amazon workers took advantage of that by pairing a successful seller with one who had little business to gain insights into particular products.</p><p>\"You have access to data that other sellers do not have,\" Jayapal said. \"The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. ...That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>2:42 P.M.Committee members came out swinging, often catching CEOs flat-footed </p><p>The first batch of questions saw the CEOs collectively struggle to directly answer lawmakers, who came armed with well-researched questions and strong opinions - a shift in gear from previous congressional tech hearings. </p><p>The one exception was Jeff Bezos, who escaped all questions for the first hour. </p><p>As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's management of Instagram, citing the Federal Trade Commission's original decision not to challenge the company's 2012 merger with Instagram, hearing chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) dismissed Zuckerberg, saying the \"failures\" of the FTC in 2012 \"do not alleviate\" Facebook's current antitrust challenges. </p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai tried to fend off questions by citing examples of individual vendors using Google to grow their business, before Cicilline cut him off for not answering the question.</p><p>Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) reeled off a list of possible links and alignment between Google and the Chinese Communist Party, leaving Pichai to say only that Google had only a \"very limited presence\" in China. He repeated that answer to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who repeated charges by tech investor Peter Thiel that Google's China links are \"treason,\" and concerns from Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in 2018 that Google's artificial intelligence work in China puts the U.S. military at a competitive disadvantage. - Ryan Heath</p><p>2:19 P.M.Apple's App Store treats developers fairly, Cook says</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook rejected allegations that the company's App Store rules for developers are enforced arbitrarily and argued that the company must compete with rivals to interest developers in building apps for its iPhone and iPad.</p><p> \"We treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules,\" Cook said under questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). \"Those rules apply evenly to everyone.\"</p><p>Cook said the majority of apps sold through the App Store, 84 percent, pay no fees. The remainder pay either a 30 percent or 15 percent commission, he said. </p><p>Johnson noted that Amazon has an agreement with Apple to allow users to bypass the iPhone's in-app payment service, and its 30 percent fee, and instead use the credit card on file in their Amazon account for the Amazon Prime Video app. Cook said that would be \"available to anyone meeting the conditions,\" though he didn't outline what those conditions are.</p><p>The Apple CEO also argued that the company must compete to attract developers, who could offer apps for Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows or XBox or Nintendo's Playstation. </p><p>\"There's a competition for developers just like there's a competition for customers,\" Cook said. \"It's so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>2:15 P.M.Zuckerberg: Buying Instagram was 'buying time'</p><p>We're starting to see some fruits of the subcommittee's year-plus investigation, and it's got Zuckerberg on the defensive. </p><p>The Facebook CEO and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler went back and forth over internal company emails in which, Nadler said, Zuckerberg told a colleague back in 2012 that it was buying the photo-sharing Instagram because it could \"meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's thinking at the time could become a critical piece of evidence if it bolsters the idea that Facebook was abusing its dominance - and deep coffers - to eliminate budding rivals. Facebook's buying up of Instagram has become a key focus for critics of the company, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others saying the deal should be unwound. That's a threat for Facebook: Instagram has become wildly popular in its own right, and is central to Zuckerberg's plan to keep a toe hold with younger generations who are otherwise flocking to sites like TikTok.</p><p>\"Did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram?\" Nadler asked. </p><p>\"Congressman...,\" started Zuckerberg, attempting to make the case that no one at the time saw Instagram has a general social network app, rather than a really good photo-sharing app. Nadler pressed on: \"Yes or no: Did you mean that?\"</p><p>Then Nadler went for the kill, asking what Zuckerberg meant when he wrote that \"what we're really buying is time,\" adding, \"Mr. Zuckerberg: Mergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws.\" </p><p>Zuckerberg tried again, insisting that the Federal Trade Commission knew how Facebook was thinking about Instagram back when it signed off on the merger almost a decade ago. That's when antitrust subcommittee David Cicilline (D-R.I.) jumped in: \"I would remind the witness that the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described.\" </p><p>Translation: Don't think this is over just because that agency down the road said it was.-Nancy Scola</p><p>2:04 p.m.Sensenbrenner presses Zuckerberg over Twitter's Don Jr. call </p><p>A top House Republican used his questioning to press Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a recent content moderation squabble involving Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, with Twitter. </p><p>\"It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. Although Sensenbrenner said he wouldn't take the medication, the lawmaker said, \"I think this is a legitimate matter of discussion.\" </p><p>\"Why has that happened?\" Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg. </p><p>\"Congressman, first, to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that,\" the Facebook CEO said. \"But I can talk to our policies about this.\" </p><p>Zuckerberg said Facebook would take down any claim a proven cure for Covid-19 exists when there is none, given the potential imminent risk for harm, although he said the social platform would allow free discussion about drug trials and what people may think more generally about a treatment's prospects.</p><p>\"Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas,\" Zuckerberg told Sensebrenner. \"Frankly I think we've distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most.\" - John Hendel</p><p>1:58 P.M.Google: We don't steal </p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied that the search giant steals content from other websites and rejected reports alleging that the company steers users to its own products and sites rather than sources elsewhere on the web.</p><p>\"We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information,\" Pichai said in response to pointed questions from House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who said the panel had seen evidence about Google taking content from other websites and placing more ads on its search results. \"The vast majority of queries on Google, we don't show ads at all.\"</p><p>Cicilline cited an investigation by The Markup that showed Google has devoted more space on the first page of search results to its own products -- which earn the company more revenue that if users go to other webpages. Pichai said that Google only shows ads when consumers are seeking to buy products and argued that they compete with other e-commerce platforms, like Amazon, where consumers often go directly to try to find products.</p><p>\"When I run the company I'm really focused on giving users what they want,\" Pichai said. \"We see vigorous competition, whether it be travel or real estate, and we are working hard to innovate.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Google in the early 2010s found Google \"scraped\" content from other websites, including Yelp and TripAdvisor. The company agreed to allow other companies to opt out of having their content scraped through 2017.- Leah Nylen</p><p>1:51 P.M.Facebook: We're an underdog - just look at the rest of this witness list </p><p>One surprise so far in the hearing: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who generally likes to stick fairly religiously to a script in his public appearances, went far afield from his written testimony - including strongly arguing that his 2-billion-member social network is an underdog when you look at the behemoths he's testifying alongside.</p><p>Zuckerberg pointed out that Facebook competes with other companies that, too, have hundreds of millions or even billions of users. </p><p>\"Some are upstarts,\" said Zuckerberg, \"but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their apps stores to compete with them\" - a seeming shot at Apple, with whom Facebook has no love lost. (Apple CEO Tim Cook was off-screen at the time.)</p><p>And it's not just Apple, argued Zuckerberg, who added that Facebook has to battle with YouTube when it comes to video and Amazon when it comes to the online ads market. </p><p> \"In many areas we're behind our competitors,\" said Zuckerberg. That's not what you'd expect a CEO to a multibillion-dollar titan to say, but it's a direct rebuke to the very premise of the hearing - that Facebook is so giant, so powerful, that Washington needs to step in.- Nancy Scola</p><p>1:49 P.M.Tim Cook delivers opening statement</p><p>Read his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff</p><p>1:43 P.M.Sundar Pichai delivers opening statement</p><p>Read his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff</p><p>1:40 P.M.Jeff Bezos delivers opening statement</p><p>\"Just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told the antitrust subcommittee Wednesday - while arguing that his online commerce giant is not all that large when considered as a percentage of the global retail market.</p><p>Bezos, the world's richest person, also pointed to his humble origins, noting that \"my mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque.\"</p><p>Read the rest of his prepared testimony here.- Bob King</p><p>1:35 P.M.Jordan: They're out to get us</p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan said at the hearing's outset - a not-unexpected outburst from the top Republican on the full Judiciary Committee, who has become a public face of the complaints from some on the right that Silicon Valley is innately biased against them. </p><p>Jordan also brought up the fact that he'd hoped to have Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter - a frequent target of Jordan, President Donald Trump, and other Republicans - testify at the hearing, a request shot down by Democrats.</p><p>Jordan also made a last-minute request to rope into the hearing another Republican member, who's not on the subcommittee, to dig into the alleged constitutional questions raised by the companies testifying. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) wasn't having it - a signal that he intends to keep the hearing on topic. - Nancy Scola</p><p>1:20 P.M.Sensenbrenner: 'Conservatives are consumers too'</p><p>The Republican leader of the House Judiciary antitrust panel became the first to raise concerns about \"conservative bias\" by the biggest U.S. tech companies. </p><p>In his opening statement, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) emphasized that a firm's large size doesn't mean they are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Rather, how the problem is how they use that power.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter have become the public square of today where political debates play out in real time,\" Sensenbrenner said in his opening statement. \"Conservatives are consumers too and they need the protection of the antitrust laws. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities.\"</p><p>But like his counterpart, panel chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sensenbrenner said he hopes to examine the size and power of the U.S. four biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"Your companies are large. That's not a problem. Your companies are successful. That's not a problem either,\" he said. \"I want to leave here today with a more complete picture of how your individual companies use your size, success and power and what it means to the American consumer.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>1:04 P.M.Interest groups clamor to raise other tech complaints </p><p>Tech companies have become such a political flashpoint - and exert such influence on our economy and society - that dozens of interest groups are angling to get their issues into the record today, during a hearing whose stated topic is antitrust.</p><p>Data privacy and misinformation are two themes that many groups want to see raised. </p><p>The NAACP is one group with a particularly compelling - though off-topic - message. NAACP tweeted that it hopes the hearing \"addresses [the] devastating conclusion of civil rights audit of @Facebook - that company allows hate speech &amp; disinformation to thrive.\" Facebook denies those allegations. - Ryan Heath</p><p>1 P.M.Cicilline vows to check 'emperors of the online economy'</p><p>The top Democrat leading the House Judiciary antitrust panel's investigation into competition in digital markets said the nation's largest tech companies have \"too much power.\" </p><p>\"As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses, and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in his opening statement. \"Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p>The antitrust subcommittee's investigation, opened last summer and focused on conduct by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, has so far compiled millions of documents and hundreds of hours of interviews from more than 100 companies, Cicilline said. While he acknowledged that the four companies operate in different markets, Cicilline said the quartet act in similar ways. They are \"critical arteries of commerce and communications\" who use their control over access or marketplaces to surveil rivals and wield their power in order to expand into other markets.</p><p>\"Simply put: They have too much power,\" Cicilline said. \"This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation. And while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.\"</p><p>Read the rest of his opening remarks here. - Leah Nylen</p><p>12:30 P.M. Trump's hearing counterprogramming includes threat of more executive orders</p><p>President Donald Trump, who earlier in the day told reporters he'll be watching Wednesday's hearing, is now saying he's ready to take executive action to rein in the tech giants. </p><p>Trump in May already issued a hotly contested executive order aimed at what he called social media censorship, which he signed in the middle of sparring with Twitter over its attempts to fact-check his tweeting. </p><p>Under directives from that order, the Commerce Department petitioned the Federal Communications Commission this week asking the independent agency to narrow the liability protections shielding internet companies from lawsuits over the content their users post. The administration petition also asks the FCC, which doesn't regulate social media, to mandate that internet companies offer more transparent disclosure about their moderation policies. - John Hendel</p><p>12:12 p.m.The world is watching today's hearings</p><p>Heading into Wednesday's hearings, America's big tech firms had similar messages emphasizing that \"we're good for America.\" While that may or may not be true, what is certain is that this hearing has a global audience. </p><p>As CEOs of global companies, today's witnesses run the risk of inflaming regulators and antitrust enforcers in other countries by playing the American patriotism card. Apple and Google have major open cases in Brussels, for example, and when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, it immediately sparked demands from the European Parliament and elsewhere that he appear. British lawmakers are still peeved that he's avoided appearances in London. </p><p>We've seen before - in European antitrust cases - companies like Google and Microsoft shift discussions about technical antitrust matters into broader discussions: essentially saying that because consumers like their products, competition problems and hidden costs either don't exist or do not need to be addressed by regulators and courts. </p><p>Those arguments were effective in initial stages of public debate in Europe, but fell flat over time. Based on their opening statements, the CEOs run the risk of making a similar miscalculation today.- Ryan Heath</p><p>12:04 P.M. Hearing delayed 1 hour</p><p>The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with tech company CEOs will start later than planned to allow time to clean the hearing room, a spokesperson for the panel said.</p><p>An earlier 9:30 a.m. hearing before the Judiciary Committee's immigration panel finished up later than expected. Richard Luchette, a spokesperson for antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), said standard committee procedure requires cleaning of the room between meetings.</p><p>The hearing with the top executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will now begin at 1 p.m., Judiciary Committee spokesperson Shadawn Reddick-Smith said in an e-mail.- Leah Nylen</p><p>11:44 A.M.Trump: 'What the big tech companies are doing is very bad'</p><p>President Donald Trump plans to watch Wednesday's hearing, he told reporters outside the White House earlier in the day.</p><p>\"We're going to be watching the hearing today very closely,\" the president said. \"Because there's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad.\"</p><p>Trump has long criticized the U.S. tech giants over how they moderate content, including accusing them of making it hard for his supporters to find his posts. They have denied doing any such thing, although some companies - especially Twitter - have started placing warning or fact-checking notices on some of his statements.- John Hendel</p><p>10:13 A.M. TikTok CEO slams Zuckerberg's China comments just before hearing</p><p>TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer slammed Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes congressional hearing, where the tech mogul is expected to picture Chinese tech corporations as a threat.</p><p>\"Let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.,\" Mayer said in a statement.</p><p>Zuckerberg depicted Facebook in his prepared statement for the hearing as a \"proudly American company.\"</p><p>U.S. officials have recently floated a ban on TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance. If the company were to leave the U.S. market, American advertisers would be left with less choice, Mayer argued.</p><p>The newly appointed CEO, who comes from Disney, also said tech companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows to regulators. \"We will not wait for regulation to come, but instead TikTok has taken the first step by launching a Transparency and Accountability Center for moderation and data practices,\" he explained.</p><p>\"TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\" Mayer said.- Laura Kayali</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-386327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-R2R1-JDJ6-K2HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5909\"/><timeReceived>5:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) cited a new report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance that found Amazon brought in nearly $60 billion from seller fees last year - 21 percent of Amazon's total revenue - and that the e-commerce giant keeps about 30 percent of each sale. That amount is up from 19 percent of each sale five years ago.</p><p>Bezos said the increased amount is because sellers are spending more money with Amazon by using additional services such as Fulfillment by Amazon, where the company stores and ships products on behalf of third-party sellers.</p><p>\"When you see these fees going up, sellers are choosing to use more of our services we make available,\" he said. \"Previously they were shipping their own products from their own fulfillment centers so they would have had costs doing that. ... Now they are doing that through Fulfilment by Amazon.\"</p><p>Bezos also acknowledged that the Buy Box - which preselects the seller for when a user clicks on a product - \"indirectly\" favors sellers who use the Fulfilled by Amazon services.</p><p>\"Indirectly, I think the Buy Box does favor products that can be shipped with Prime,\" he said. \"The Buy Box is trying to pick the offer that we predict the customer would most like. That includes price, that includes delivery speed, and if you're a Prime member, it includes whether the item is eligible for Prime.\"</p><p>In response to questions from Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ill.) about stolen and counterfeit goods, Bezos said he believes that Amazon requires sellers to provide a real name and address, but wasn't sure whether a phone number is required. He also said he didn't know how many resources Amazon devotes to seller verification.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took a rare swipe against a core feature of his Silicon Valley competitors late in today's hearing, singling out social media as destructive for free expression.</p><p>\"What I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a 'nuance destruction machine,'\" Bezos said. \"And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy.\"</p><p>Bezos offered his critique while testifying by videoconference, alongside the head of social media giant Facebook.</p><p>He was responding to House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who was invoking the idea of \"cancel culture\" and the notion of online mobs that shout down unfashionable opinions. The lawmaker was assessing whether lawmakers were concerned about the polarizing idea, which some question as overblown.</p><p>\"I am concerned in general about that,\" Bezos told Jordan.</p><p>Other tech CEOs also appeared sympathetic to Jordan's cancel culture worries.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook noted he wasn't \"all the way up to speed\" on the idea but expressed concern: \"If you're about where somebody with a different point of view talks, and they're 'canceled,' I don't think that's good. I think it's good for people to hear from different points of view and decide for themselves.\"</p><p>\"I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country that are pushing against free expression,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Jordan, without identifying specifics.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai simply noted the interest in building platforms to allow freedom of expression. - John Hendel</p><p>The Chinese government steals U.S. technologies, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said - making him the only one of the four tech CEOs willing to say that plainly in response to a question from Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.).</p><p>\"I think it's well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook said he had no personal knowledge about Chinese technology theft.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai initially followed Cook's line, but later corrected the record to confirm that in 2009 China stole Google information in a \"well-publicized\" cyberattack.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who answered last, acknowledged that he had read \"many reports\" about technology theft by Beijing, but had no first-hand experience beyond knock-off products sold on Amazon.</p><p>All four CEOs passed on the opportunity to suggest how Congress could better help defend U.S. companies abroad, against either technology theft or excessive regulation.- Leah Nylen and Ryan Heath</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House's probe into tech giants, accused Facebook of tolerating a fountain of misinformation that benefits the company's engagement-driven business model - even on topics as deadly as the coronavirus. </p><p>\"There's no competition forcing you to police your own platform,\" the House antitrust subcommittee chairman told CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"During the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime, don't you agree that these articles viewed by millions on your platform will cost lives?\"</p><p>The lawmaker cited articles that drew millions of views on sites like Facebook while making claims about Covid-19, including those describing President Donald Trump's musings about placing disinfectants inside the body or allegations that coronavirus \"hype\" is a political hoax. </p><p>Cicilline said Facebook allows such content to reap advertising dollars. But Zuckerberg countered that this kind of noxious material is not \"helpful for our business.\"</p><p>\"It is not what people want to see, and we rank what we show in Feed based on what is going to be most meaningful to people and what is going to create long-term satisfaction,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of taking down bogus information that could cause imminent harm and its attempt to highlight authoritative guidance. But Cicilline brought up a Monday video from the conservative website Breitbart, which dismissed the necessity of masks and called hydroxychloroquine a Covid-19 cure - and which experienced soaring Facebook traffic over several hours before Facebook removed it. </p><p>\"A lot of people shared that,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we did take it down because it violates our policies.\"</p><p>\"After 20 million people saw it after a period of five hours?\" Cicilline countered. \"Doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?\" - John Hendel</p><p>Apple didn't consider the impact on its own parental control app when it removed some of the most popular apps that limit screentime from its App Store, CEO Tim Cook told lawmakers.</p><p>Apple introduced its own Screen Time app, which allows parents to limit how much time kids spend on their phones, in September 2018. After that, the company removed a number of competing apps. Qustodio and Kidslox, two of the leading parental control apps, have filed a complaint with the European Commission about their removal.</p><p>Cook said Apple removed the apps because of privacy concerns.</p><p>\"We were worried about the safety of kids,\" Cook said in response to questions by Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.).</p><p>Demings asked Cook why the company removed many of the most popular screentime apps but not Absher, an app created by the Saudi Arabian government that uses the same technology. </p><p>\"It sounds like you applied different rules to the same apps,\" Demings said.</p><p>Cook said he wasn't familiar with Absher, but said the App Store has about 30 parental control apps after it changed its policy last year. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who returned to the issue later in the hearing, noted that Apple eventually allowed the apps back into the App Store after six months without requiring major changes.</p><p>\"We apply the rules to all developers equally,\" Cook said. \"I see Screen Time as just an alternative. There's vibrant competition for parental controls out there.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>Facebook has \"certainly adapted features\" from competing services, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday, but he denied it has threatened to copy start-ups if they wouldn't sell to his company.</p><p>But Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) expressed skepticism about his answer, reading from text messages between Zuckerberg and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and messages between Systrom and a venture capitalist. She asked Zuckerberg whether he \"threatened\" Systrom and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel by saying he would clone their products if they didn't sell to Facebook. The company bought Instagram in 2012, but Snap rebuffed offers to sell to the social network. </p><p>The House subcommittee also posted those documents to its website Wednesday.</p><p>\"I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten,'\" Zuckerberg said, referring to the company's effort to build an app called Facebook Camera. \"It was public we were building a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing.</p><p>\"It was clear this was a space we were going to compete in one way or another,\" he said. \"I don't think those are a threat in any way.\"</p><p>Jayapal reminded Zuckerberg he was under oath while testifying.</p><p>In closing her questioning, Jayapal said she didn't believe threats should be a normal business practice. </p><p>\"Facebook is a case study in monopoly power, in my opinion, because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on your competitors and copy, acquire and kill rivals,\" she said. \"You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and ensure you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance.\" - Leah Nylen</p><p>House Judiciary Democrats lost a big potential GOP ally if they had any hopes of bipartisan recommendations to update antitrust law as part of their probe into tech giants. </p><p>\"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, said hours into the hearing on alleged bad behavior by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. \"They've been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.\"</p><p>The subcommittee's probe has been led by Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who has been preparing a report to conclude the long investigation. GOP buy-in would strongly bolster its conclusions, including potential recommendations for updates to antitrust law.</p><p>Notably, Sensenbrenner seemed to support the probe itself and said he's \"been working with the chairman for over a year on this bipartisan investigation.\" His support runs counter to some Republicans who have disparaged Democratic handling of the probe. </p><p>But Congress shouldn't toss out a century of precedent, added the retiring House Republican. He said lawmakers should instead pressure antitrust regulators like the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has faced accusations of going lightly on companies like Facebook and Google.  - John Hendel</p><p>Tempers flared more than two hours into the hearing after Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-Pa.) began her questioning with a dismissal of what she called \"fringe conspiracy theories\" of House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).</p><p>That prompted an outburst from Jordan, who had just pressed Google on whether it's biased toward Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and said he had internal evidence of the search giant's interest in encouraging Latino voters in 2016. </p><p>The only problem: It was no longer Jordan's time to speak, as Democrats immediately reminded him as they shouted him down.</p><p>\"Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!\" antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) declared amid gavel slamming. </p><p>When someone told him to wear a mask, Jordan sought to bring up the \"unmasking\" - in the surveillance sense - of former Trump White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. </p><p>\"When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond,\" Jordan said before letting the hearing proceed. </p><p>For the record, Google CEO Sundar Pichai maintained that his company is apolitical. - John Hendel</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is still investigating whether employees may have used data it acquires from its third-party sellers to launch competing products - an issue that has prompted allegations that the company misled House lawmakers a year ago.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,\" Bezos said in response to questions from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district includes Amazon headquarters. \"If we found someone violated the policy, we would take action against them.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Amazon employees frequently looked at seller data to help determine what products the company should offer, contrary to what an Amazon executive told the House a year ago. Jayapal also quoted a former Amazon employee as telling the panel that seller data is \"a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want.\"</p><p>Bezos also acknowledged that while company policy might prevent employees from looking at a specific seller's information, they could look at aggregate data. Jayapal and The Wall Street Journal story noted that Amazon workers took advantage of that by pairing a successful seller with one who had little business to gain insights into particular products.</p><p>\"You have access to data that other sellers do not have,\" Jayapal said. \"The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. ...That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>The first batch of questions saw the CEOs collectively struggle to directly answer lawmakers, who came armed with well-researched questions and strong opinions - a shift in gear from previous congressional tech hearings. </p><p>The one exception was Jeff Bezos, who escaped all questions for the first hour. </p><p>As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's management of Instagram, citing the Federal Trade Commission's original decision not to challenge the company's 2012 merger with Instagram, hearing chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) dismissed Zuckerberg, saying the \"failures\" of the FTC in 2012 \"do not alleviate\" Facebook's current antitrust challenges. </p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai tried to fend off questions by citing examples of individual vendors using Google to grow their business, before Cicilline cut him off for not answering the question.</p><p>Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) reeled off a list of possible links and alignment between Google and the Chinese Communist Party, leaving Pichai to say only that Google had only a \"very limited presence\" in China. He repeated that answer to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who repeated charges by tech investor Peter Thiel that Google's China links are \"treason,\" and concerns from Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in 2018 that Google's artificial intelligence work in China puts the U.S. military at a competitive disadvantage. - Ryan Heath</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook rejected allegations that the company's App Store rules for developers are enforced arbitrarily and argued that the company must compete with rivals to interest developers in building apps for its iPhone and iPad.</p><p> \"We treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules,\" Cook said under questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). \"Those rules apply evenly to everyone.\"</p><p>Cook said the majority of apps sold through the App Store, 84 percent, pay no fees. The remainder pay either a 30 percent or 15 percent commission, he said. </p><p>Johnson noted that Amazon has an agreement with Apple to allow users to bypass the iPhone's in-app payment service, and its 30 percent fee, and instead use the credit card on file in their Amazon account for the Amazon Prime Video app. Cook said that would be \"available to anyone meeting the conditions,\" though he didn't outline what those conditions are.</p><p>The Apple CEO also argued that the company must compete to attract developers, who could offer apps for Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows or XBox or Nintendo's Playstation. </p><p>\"There's a competition for developers just like there's a competition for customers,\" Cook said. \"It's so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>We're starting to see some fruits of the subcommittee's year-plus investigation, and it's got Zuckerberg on the defensive. </p><p>The Facebook CEO and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler went back and forth over internal company emails in which, Nadler said, Zuckerberg told a colleague back in 2012 that it was buying the photo-sharing Instagram because it could \"meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's thinking at the time could become a critical piece of evidence if it bolsters the idea that Facebook was abusing its dominance - and deep coffers - to eliminate budding rivals. Facebook's buying up of Instagram has become a key focus for critics of the company, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others saying the deal should be unwound. That's a threat for Facebook: Instagram has become wildly popular in its own right, and is central to Zuckerberg's plan to keep a toe hold with younger generations who are otherwise flocking to sites like TikTok.</p><p>\"Did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram?\" Nadler asked. </p><p>\"Congressman...,\" started Zuckerberg, attempting to make the case that no one at the time saw Instagram has a general social network app, rather than a really good photo-sharing app. Nadler pressed on: \"Yes or no: Did you mean that?\"</p><p>Then Nadler went for the kill, asking what Zuckerberg meant when he wrote that \"what we're really buying is time,\" adding, \"Mr. Zuckerberg: Mergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws.\" </p><p>Zuckerberg tried again, insisting that the Federal Trade Commission knew how Facebook was thinking about Instagram back when it signed off on the merger almost a decade ago. That's when antitrust subcommittee David Cicilline (D-R.I.) jumped in: \"I would remind the witness that the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described.\" </p><p>Translation: Don't think this is over just because that agency down the road said it was.-Nancy Scola</p><p>A top House Republican used his questioning to press Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a recent content moderation squabble involving Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, with Twitter. </p><p>\"It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. Although Sensenbrenner said he wouldn't take the medication, the lawmaker said, \"I think this is a legitimate matter of discussion.\" </p><p>\"Why has that happened?\" Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg. </p><p>\"Congressman, first, to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that,\" the Facebook CEO said. \"But I can talk to our policies about this.\" </p><p>Zuckerberg said Facebook would take down any claim a proven cure for Covid-19 exists when there is none, given the potential imminent risk for harm, although he said the social platform would allow free discussion about drug trials and what people may think more generally about a treatment's prospects.</p><p>\"Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas,\" Zuckerberg told Sensebrenner. \"Frankly I think we've distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most.\" - John Hendel</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied that the search giant steals content from other websites and rejected reports alleging that the company steers users to its own products and sites rather than sources elsewhere on the web.</p><p>\"We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information,\" Pichai said in response to pointed questions from House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who said the panel had seen evidence about Google taking content from other websites and placing more ads on its search results. \"The vast majority of queries on Google, we don't show ads at all.\"</p><p>Cicilline cited an investigation by The Markup that showed Google has devoted more space on the first page of search results to its own products -- which earn the company more revenue that if users go to other webpages. Pichai said that Google only shows ads when consumers are seeking to buy products and argued that they compete with other e-commerce platforms, like Amazon, where consumers often go directly to try to find products.</p><p>\"When I run the company I'm really focused on giving users what they want,\" Pichai said. \"We see vigorous competition, whether it be travel or real estate, and we are working hard to innovate.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Google in the early 2010s found Google \"scraped\" content from other websites, including Yelp and TripAdvisor. The company agreed to allow other companies to opt out of having their content scraped through 2017.- Leah Nylen</p><p>One surprise so far in the hearing: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who generally likes to stick fairly religiously to a script in his public appearances, went far afield from his written testimony - including strongly arguing that his 2-billion-member social network is an underdog when you look at the behemoths he's testifying alongside.</p><p>Zuckerberg pointed out that Facebook competes with other companies that, too, have hundreds of millions or even billions of users. </p><p>\"Some are upstarts,\" said Zuckerberg, \"but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their apps stores to compete with them\" - a seeming shot at Apple, with whom Facebook has no love lost. (Apple CEO Tim Cook was off-screen at the time.)</p><p>And it's not just Apple, argued Zuckerberg, who added that Facebook has to battle with YouTube when it comes to video and Amazon when it comes to the online ads market. </p><p> \"In many areas we're behind our competitors,\" said Zuckerberg. That's not what you'd expect a CEO to a multibillion-dollar titan to say, but it's a direct rebuke to the very premise of the hearing - that Facebook is so giant, so powerful, that Washington needs to step in.- Nancy Scola</p><p>Read his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff</p><p>Read his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff</p><p>\"Just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told the antitrust subcommittee Wednesday - while arguing that his online commerce giant is not all that large when considered as a percentage of the global retail market.</p><p>Bezos, the world's richest person, also pointed to his humble origins, noting that \"my mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque.\"</p><p>Read the rest of his prepared testimony here.- Bob King</p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan said at the hearing's outset - a not-unexpected outburst from the top Republican on the full Judiciary Committee, who has become a public face of the complaints from some on the right that Silicon Valley is innately biased against them. </p><p>Jordan also brought up the fact that he'd hoped to have Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter - a frequent target of Jordan, President Donald Trump, and other Republicans - testify at the hearing, a request shot down by Democrats.</p><p>Jordan also made a last-minute request to rope into the hearing another Republican member, who's not on the subcommittee, to dig into the alleged constitutional questions raised by the companies testifying. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) wasn't having it - a signal that he intends to keep the hearing on topic. - Nancy Scola</p><p>The Republican leader of the House Judiciary antitrust panel became the first to raise concerns about \"conservative bias\" by the biggest U.S. tech companies. </p><p>In his opening statement, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) emphasized that a firm's large size doesn't mean they are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Rather, how the problem is how they use that power.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter have become the public square of today where political debates play out in real time,\" Sensenbrenner said in his opening statement. \"Conservatives are consumers too and they need the protection of the antitrust laws. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities.\"</p><p>But like his counterpart, panel chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sensenbrenner said he hopes to examine the size and power of the U.S. four biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"Your companies are large. That's not a problem. Your companies are successful. That's not a problem either,\" he said. \"I want to leave here today with a more complete picture of how your individual companies use your size, success and power and what it means to the American consumer.\"- Leah Nylen</p><p>Tech companies have become such a political flashpoint - and exert such influence on our economy and society - that dozens of interest groups are angling to get their issues into the record today, during a hearing whose stated topic is antitrust.</p><p>Data privacy and misinformation are two themes that many groups want to see raised. </p><p>The NAACP is one group with a particularly compelling - though off-topic - message. NAACP tweeted that it hopes the hearing \"addresses [the] devastating conclusion of civil rights audit of @Facebook - that company allows hate speech &amp; disinformation to thrive.\" Facebook denies those allegations. - Ryan Heath</p><p>The top Democrat leading the House Judiciary antitrust panel's investigation into competition in digital markets said the nation's largest tech companies have \"too much power.\" </p><p>\"As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses, and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in his opening statement. \"Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p>The antitrust subcommittee's investigation, opened last summer and focused on conduct by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, has so far compiled millions of documents and hundreds of hours of interviews from more than 100 companies, Cicilline said. While he acknowledged that the four companies operate in different markets, Cicilline said the quartet act in similar ways. They are \"critical arteries of commerce and communications\" who use their control over access or marketplaces to surveil rivals and wield their power in order to expand into other markets.</p><p>\"Simply put: They have too much power,\" Cicilline said. \"This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation. And while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.\"</p><p>Read the rest of his opening remarks here. - Leah Nylen</p><p>President Donald Trump, who earlier in the day told reporters he'll be watching Wednesday's hearing, is now saying he's ready to take executive action to rein in the tech giants. </p><p>Trump in May already issued a hotly contested executive order aimed at what he called social media censorship, which he signed in the middle of sparring with Twitter over its attempts to fact-check his tweeting. </p><p>Under directives from that order, the Commerce Department petitioned the Federal Communications Commission this week asking the independent agency to narrow the liability protections shielding internet companies from lawsuits over the content their users post. The administration petition also asks the FCC, which doesn't regulate social media, to mandate that internet companies offer more transparent disclosure about their moderation policies. - John Hendel</p><p>Heading into Wednesday's hearings, America's big tech firms had similar messages emphasizing that \"we're good for America.\" While that may or may not be true, what is certain is that this hearing has a global audience. </p><p>As CEOs of global companies, today's witnesses run the risk of inflaming regulators and antitrust enforcers in other countries by playing the American patriotism card. Apple and Google have major open cases in Brussels, for example, and when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, it immediately sparked demands from the European Parliament and elsewhere that he appear. British lawmakers are still peeved that he's avoided appearances in London. </p><p>We've seen before - in European antitrust cases - companies like Google and Microsoft shift discussions about technical antitrust matters into broader discussions: essentially saying that because consumers like their products, competition problems and hidden costs either don't exist or do not need to be addressed by regulators and courts. </p><p>Those arguments were effective in initial stages of public debate in Europe, but fell flat over time. Based on their opening statements, the CEOs run the risk of making a similar miscalculation today.- Ryan Heath</p><p>The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with tech company CEOs will start later than planned to allow time to clean the hearing room, a spokesperson for the panel said.</p><p>An earlier 9:30 a.m. hearing before the Judiciary Committee's immigration panel finished up later than expected. Richard Luchette, a spokesperson for antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), said standard committee procedure requires cleaning of the room between meetings.</p><p>The hearing with the top executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will now begin at 1 p.m., Judiciary Committee spokesperson Shadawn Reddick-Smith said in an e-mail.- Leah Nylen</p><p>President Donald Trump plans to watch Wednesday's hearing, he told reporters outside the White House earlier in the day.</p><p>\"We're going to be watching the hearing today very closely,\" the president said. \"Because there's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad.\"</p><p>Trump has long criticized the U.S. tech giants over how they moderate content, including accusing them of making it hard for his supporters to find his posts. They have denied doing any such thing, although some companies - especially Twitter - have started placing warning or fact-checking notices on some of his statements.- John Hendel</p><p>TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer slammed Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes congressional hearing, where the tech mogul is expected to picture Chinese tech corporations as a threat.</p><p>\"Let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.,\" Mayer said in a statement.</p><p>Zuckerberg depicted Facebook in his prepared statement for the hearing as a \"proudly American company.\"</p><p>U.S. officials have recently floated a ban on TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

The FTC sent letters asking about \"potentially anticompetitive acquisitions\" the companies had made over the past decade but not yet reported to the agency. The inquiry comes amid numerous other antitrust investigations into the tech industry in both the US and Europe. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. The Federal Trade Commission is looking into past acquisitions made by major tech companies, the agency announced in a press release[3] Tuesday. The FTC said it had sent orders to Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, asking for \"information about prior acquisitions not reported to the antitrust agencies\" the companies may have made over the past decade. \"This initiative will enable the Commission to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition. This will help us continue to keep tech markets open and competitive, for the benefit of consumers,\" FTC chairman Joseph Simons said in the statement. Companies are required to report some, but not all, acquisitions to regulators under federal law, but the FTC's investigation indicates it is looking into past purchases that may have flown under the radar. The announcement come as major tech companies are already facing a variety of antitrust probes[4] from regulators in both the US and in Europe looking into whether the firms are unfairly undermining competition. The investigations are looking into everything from Google's advertising business[5] to Amazon Web Services[6] to Facebook's handling of consumer data and privacy issues[7].NOW WATCH: What it's like

The e-commerce behemoth will also come under scrutiny from the House Judiciary Committee, which announced on Monday that it is opening an antitrust investigation into big tech, which will look at whether the sector's biggest companies are hindering competition and harming consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications,\" Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.</p><p>While the FTC has not yet announced a formal investigation of Amazon, the consumer protection agency has, over the past few months, questioned some of the retail giant's competitors about several of its business practices, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/4/18651694/amazon-ftc-antitrust-investigation-prime\">according to Recode</url>.</p><p>One of the topics the agency has focused on is one that has also come under fire from presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other politicians: Amazon's alleged practice of competing with its own sellers using the data it collects as a platform. The company's expansion into private-label goods has been well documented, and shoppers today will see Amazon-owned brands sold alongside third-party products in categories ranging from footwear to batteries. (Amazon now has 140 private label brands - up from only 27 in 2017 - and 511 exclusive brands, according to the independent analytics firm TJI Research.) These goods offer the company better profit margins, a wider selection of products and potential leverage to put pricing pressure on third-party sellers.</p><p>In a post published earlier this year on Medium, Warren - who has called for the breakup of Amazon, Google and Facebook - accused the retailer of \"[crushing] small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version.\"</p><p>She repeated the accusation in a town hall in April, in response to which Amazon tweeted the following statement: \"We don't use individual sellers' data to launch private-label products (which account for only about 1% of sales). And sellers aren't being 'knocked out' - they're seeing record sales every year.\"</p><p>Per Recode, the FTC has also talked with the company's rivals about its Fulfillment By Amazon program, which allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's storage, fulfillment and shipping services for items sold through other retailers (such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/t/ebay-2/\">eBay</url> and Etsy) - but at fees of up to 75% more than if the item had been sold through Amazon.com.</p><p>Finally, it's looking at Amazon Prime, a program that surpassed the 100-million-member mark in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to an estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners Inc. (CEO Jeff Bezos revealed last April that the service had surpassed that number globally.) The $119-per-year service bundles free one-day shipping with music, movie and TV streaming benefits; Whole Foods discounts; unlimited photo storage and more - benefits that critics say make it impossible for smaller players to compete.</p><p>The increased scrutiny comes at a time when politicians from both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns about data privacy violations and monopolistic behavior within the tech industry - issues that are sure to be debated throughout the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>Want more?</p><p>How Amazon's <url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/retail/amazon-app-feature-private-label-products-1202761954/\">New Mobile Feature</url> Is Luring Shoppers Away From Rival Products</p><p>Will Amazon's <url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/retail/amazon-counterfeit-tool-project-zero-1202753933/\">New Counterfeit Tool</url> Convince More Shoe Brands to Sell on the Site?</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/2019/shop/socks/best-sand-socks-beach-1202788141/\">The Best Beach Socks for Protecting Your Feet on Hot Sand</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/2019/shop/shoes/sandals-wide-feet-womens-clarks-rockport-1202786721/\">The Best Women's Sandals for Wide Feet</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://footwearnews.com/2019/shop/shoes/best-shower-shoes-sandals-1202773928/\">The Best Shower Shoes For The Gym, Dorm or Beach</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOTWRN-1202788335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOTWRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8J-SVG1-JC3V-6377-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Footwearnews</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26326\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to the agency's announcement, this new task force will feature approximately 17 staff attorneys whose mandate will be to more closely examine the competitive tech landscape, and take action if necessary. According to the FTC, this includes taking a closer look at both pending mergers, and large technology mergers that have already happened.\"In addition to examining industry practices and conducting law enforcement investigations, the Technology Task Force will, among other things, coordinate and consult with staff throughout the FTC on technology-related matters, including prospective merger reviews in the technology sector and reviews of consummated technology mergers.\"Some, like former Chief FTC technologist Ashkan Soltani, took the announcement to mean that the FTC might just start taking antitrust more seriously in the wake of numerous embarrassing enforcement face plants on this front (like the government's comedic inability to address the glaringly obvious anticompetitive impact of AT... latest merger[2]): YES THIS!&gt; @FTC[3] signaling they're taking technology competition seriously by launching taskforce of 17 attorneys + technology fellow with expertise in - online advertising - social networking - mobile operating systems and apps - platforms businesses </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/5eT6mWHYNT\">https://t.co/5eT6mWHYNT</url>[4] \u2014 ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) February 26, 2019[5]Others were justly more skeptical. After all, examining the health of the tech market, contemplating the impact of mergers, and taking actions to address market imbalance and fraud is the FTC's entire job to begin with. And, given the FTC often fails utterly to do that job (especially in the telecom sector), a lot of folks were quick to wonder if this task force was a bit of a show pony[6]:\"I'm scornful of the new seating arrangements, because the FTC has consistently proven they do not want to wield power,' says Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, an antimonopoly think tank that has called for a breakup of Facebook. 'They want to hold hearings. They want to get their friend economists and antitrust lawyers to fly into DC and talk to each other. They don't want to do their No. 1 job, which is to police markets for unfair and anticompetitive behavior.'While I'm not sold on the need to break up Facebook, it's a solid point that the FTC should maybe focus on doing the job it already has, and layering additional bureaucracy on a broken apparatus may not be the best path forward. The FTC routinely does nothing to address problematic sectors like telecom, where anti-competitive megamergers and ripping off customers[7] is an almost daily occurrence. For example, the FTC could easily crack down on the bogus fees companies like Comcast use to jack up your advertised rate[8] using its power under the FTC Act, yet I've never seen the agency so much as fart in the direction of the problem when bigger companies are involved. While there's certainly a lot of solid complaints to be made about \"big tech\" giants like Facebook and Google (especially on the privacy front), it's also pretty obvious that a lot of the recent criticisms of \"big tech\" aren't being made in good faith. Claims of \"censorship\" of conservatives, for example, usually don't hold up under scrutiny[9], and are often driven by folks who wouldn't be facing these problems if they didn't behave like legendary assholes on the internet[10] in the first place. Similarly a lot of the recent criticism of big tech is coming from telecom giants eager to saddle Silicon Valley giants with unnecessary regulation in a bid to hoover up a bigger slice of the online advertising pie. On the one hand, telecom giants like AT...nd Verizon just got done convincing the FCC to effectively neuter itself[11], leaving any remaining oversight in the lap of an FTC they know won't (and often can't[12]) hold them accountable. At the same time, telecom lobbyists like Mike Powell have spent the last few years drumming up frothy calls to regulate \"big tech,\"[13] intentionally ignoring their own anticompetitive ambitions:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy. For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle.\"You're to ignore that telecom monopolies engage in all of this exact behavior, yet government regulators from both parties routinely turn a blind eye to it. And while Comcast desperately wants to be seen as in line with tech giants like Apple[14], you'll notice that here, telecom has somehow mystically excused itself from the table of accountability, despite being arguably the most problematic sectors in all of \"tech\" thanks to their actual, growing monopoly[15] over internet access. Yes, if the task force genuinely results in the FTC finally taking its mandate seriously, enforcing antitrust, and policing terrible behavior, all the better. But given the recent climate, it's probably wise to be wary of this effort being little more than a show pony scripted by sectors and individuals not entirely arguing in good faith.Permalink[16] |

The agency plans to study the \"hundreds\" of deals the companies have made over the last 10 years that the companies hadn't previously had to report to it. There's growing concern inside and outside the agency that the companies have used such deals to quash nascent competitors. As a result of the study, the FTC could force the companies to unwind some of their past purchases or submit prospective ones for its review, legal experts said. </p><p>Click here for more BI Prime stories[1]. In recent years, the big tech companies have made dozens of acquisitions that have largely flown under the radar screen, because the firms they acquired were relatively small. Those acquisitions are now on the radar screen of regulators, most notably the Federal Trade Commission, which announced on Tuesday that it was going to be examining smaller-scale purchases[2] made in the past by Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. That's not a good sign for those companies. The FTC's study could result in much greater scrutiny of any future purchases of small startups that they make or in the agency forcing them to undo some of their past acquisitions. \"I think this is a first step that could lead to enforcement action. It could lead to new policies,\" said Doug Melamed, a professor of the practice of law at Stanford Law School. US antitrust law \u2014 under the Hart Scott Rodino Act \u2014 requires larger companies that plan to make acquisitions over a certain size to notify antitrust authorities at the FTC and the Department of Justice. Regulatory authorities at those agencies often review those purchases and, in some cases \u2014 such as the attempt by the parent company of Schick razors to buy startup shaving company Harry's[3] \u2014 they move to block them. But companies have no duty to notify regulators about smaller acquisitions. The assumption is that such transactions don't generally affect competition in a significant way and that regulators should focus their time and resources on the bigger deals.Some worry that small acquisitions could cause big problemsSome experts and market observers, though, have started to question that assumption. In the tech industry, there are relatively few large-scale deals that are subject to government review. But there are lots of smaller deals each year that go unreported to regulators. In a conference call with reporters, FTC chairman Joe Simons estimated that the number of purchases the big five companies have made over the last decade that weren't previously disclosed to his agency numbers in the hundreds. At least some of those deals could have affected competition by allowing the dominant firms to extinguish nascent, would-be competitors. Just such concerns were raised[4] when Facebook two years ago snapped up tbh[5], a fledgling social media app that was targeted at teens. Facebook shut down tbh less than a year after acquiring it[6]. \"There's a huge question here of the shadow that the big-tech firms cast across Silicon Valley or across the startup world,\" Melamed said. The study comes amid growing scrutiny of the tech giants. The European Union has already hit Alphabet with three fines of more than a billion dollars each[7] for anti-competitive actions and has begun probes into Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. Meanwhile in the US, federal and state regulators have launched antitrust probes into those four companies. The FTC's action is likely a part of that broader inquiry into and reassessment of the power of the tech companies, legal experts told Business Insider. But the questions go beyond Silicon Valley. In a statement that accompanied the FTC's announcement of its study, the agency's two Democratic commissioners urged it to look at the impact smaller-scale acquisitions have had in industries beyond tech[8]. The dialysis industry has consolidated into two major national players, and research indicates the two companies gain power through making numerous acquisitions that were below reporting thresholds. \"Similar patterns of 'stealth consolidation' have been observed in pharmaceutical and hospital markets,\" commissioners Christine Wilson and Rohit Chopra said in their statement. \"We urge the Commission to consider similar ... studies across other industries to ensure that we have a more complete understanding about the competitive effects of non-reportable mergers writ large.\"The FTC has plenty of powerWhile the study represents the agency's first broad look at small-scale mergers in the tech industry, it's not completely unprecedented. The FTC has wide-ranging authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to conduct studies into how industries or businesses operate, and it has used that authority in the past to examine mergers and competition in particular industries. There's good reason for the agency to conduct this particular study, the legal experts said. Not a lot is known about how all the small acquisitions made by the tech giants are affecting competition in the industry, they said. While there's growing concern about that the big companies are quashing competition, \"there hasn't been, as yet, great studies and great data to demonstrate something like that is going on,\" said Prasad Krishnamurthy, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley's law school. He continued: \"There is a dearth of research on the topic.\" It's too early to know what the study will find or how the agency or other policymakers will respond to it. But one potential outcome could be that the FTC forces the big tech firms to undo some of their previous small-scale mergers. Simons himself suggested on the call that the agency could head in that direction as part of its inquiry. The agency has the authority to undo mergers and acquisitions after the fact \u2014 even ones that weren't required to be reported to it. It did just that late last year when it ordered the dissolution of a merger between two prosthetic knee companies[9], finding that their combination was anticompetitive. The merger had taken place two years earlier and had not been subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting requirements. Unwinding mergers after the fact is \"not widely done, for obvious reasons, but it has been done and they have the power to do it,\" said Donald Polden, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. The FTC could also step up its scrutiny over small-scale acquisitions in the future, whether by individual firms or across the board. The latter, though, likely would require Congress to update Hart-Scott-Rodino, Polden said. Krishnamurthy is hopeful that one of the outcomes of the study will be that the big tech companies have to start notifying regulators even when they make these kinds of smaller acquisitions, because of the general worry about their impact on competition. \"This is not a concern that is going to go away,\" he said.

Cruz\u2019s complaint that social media was discriminating against conservative opinion. Rightfully, Chairman Simons pushed back against using regulation to referee the First Amendment. However, his constrained description of the FTC\u2019s authority highlights the need for creative new responses the the ongoing collision between conservative dogma and the unconstrained activities of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Competition and Consumer Protection Intertwined</emphasis></p><p>Once upon a time, the oversight of competition and the oversight of unfair or deceptive practices were distinct areas of the law: witness today\u2019s separate FTC Bureaus of Competition and Consumer Protection. However, the unconstrained exploitation of digital technologies in recent years has welded the two legal concepts together. The unfair deception of consumers has enabled a noncompetitive industry structure which exploits consumers in turn.</p><p>Digital technology has intertwined the competition and deception issues to create new threats that require new thinking about statutory applications. Thus far, excessive faith in free market outcomes and lenient consumer protection enforcement has been exacerbated by the rapid expansion of previously unimagined digital capabilities. For instance, tech companies hiding behind \u201cprivacy policies\u201d deceive consumers into thinking that they are protected when the policies actually grant permission to violate their privacy. Having accomplished that harm, such practices provide tech companies with a hoard of aggregated consumer information that thwarts competition in sending targeted information to consumers.</p><p>The FTC is typically regarded as the agency of government most qualified to deal with the broad challenges of the internet economy. While the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) jurisdiction is limited to the nation\u2019s internet delivery networks (which the Trump FCC has declined to use, claiming the FTC is sufficient), the FTC has jurisdiction over the vast majority of the internet economy.</p><p>As defined by its Chairman, the agency seems to view its authority through one-way glass. From its perch on Pennsylvania Avenue, the agency looks outward saying \u201cour powers are limited,\u201d instead of standing outside and asking \u201cwhat does the new reality out here mean for what we can do?\u201d It is a conservative lawyer\u2019s view of the allegedly unrelated buckets of competition and deception rather than an advocate\u2019s view of competition and consumer protection, asking what to do about how new digital activities have joined the two together. Our new times demand the expansive exercise of authority to tackle new problems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Looking forward</emphasis></p><p>For the next several years we will witness this debate play out in Congress. The companies that deliver the internet, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, along with the companies riding that delivery pathway, such as Facebook and Google, will argue how regulation risks breaking the magic of the internet. Those that speak on behalf of consumers and competition will argue that only government has the power to challenge the economic muscle of the tech giants.</p><p>If past is prologue, this debate will continue well past the 2020 elections. Chairman Simons\u2019 testimony about the need for expanded authority and resources sets a litmus test for the Congress. However, the split leadership of the houses of Congress, the anti-regulation bias of the Trump Administration, and the incentive for companies to delay change as long as possible will fill the calendar with debate instead of decision.</p><p>The litmus test for Congress should also apply to the FTC itself. A forward-looking FTC could advance this debate by recognizing the convergence of unfair acts with uncompetitive behavior. Shedding its industrial interpretations could provide some short-term amelioration of current issues. Most importantly, it could draw a roadmap laying out the areas that need new legal authority. Protecting consumers and competition in the digital age requires conforming responsibilities established in the industrial era with the new realities established by information technology. The FTC needs to be as innovative in oversight as the companies are in technology.</p><p>In response to a question posed by a bearded Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), FTC Chairman Joseph Simonsdescribed the limits of his agency\u2019s authority: \u201cunless it is something that relates to a competition issue, or it\u2019s unfair or deceptive, then I don\u2019t think we have a role.\u201d No role?

The report comes as the government agencies responsible for antitrust oversight \u2014 the Justice Department (DOJ) and FTC \u2014 appear to be divvying up major tech companies for future investigations. Last Friday, The Journal reported[6] the DOJ is potentially preparing an antitrust probe against Google. On Saturday, the Washington Post[7] reported that the FTC would be responsible for looking into Amazon. Read more: How Washington insiders figured out the Trump administration was investigating Google over antitrust issues[8] The Journal could not confirm whether the FTC has formal plans to launch an antitrust investigation against Facebook any time soon. The FTC has already been investigating the social media giant for privacy concerns and its handling of user data. According to its first-quarter earnings report, Facebook expects to pay a fine to the FTC of between $3 billion and $5 billion. Although no formal antitrust investigations have been announced, the divvying of turf amongst the DOJ and FTC appears to be the government's first step into putting the tech industries largest companies under the microscope in the search for possible monopolistic practices. Curbing these tech giant's power has been on the rise in recent political rhetoric \u2014 especially in the case of Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. In March, Warren published a Medium post, outliningher plan[9]to \"unwind\" big tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, and Google. Representatives for Facebook and the FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.NOW WATCH: This London handbag company has recycled 175 tons of fire hoses into fashion accessories[10]See

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global stocks have entered their sixth straight trading day in the red as investors worry that the coronavirus outbreak is fast becoming a pandemic --- with Britain's FTSE 100 flirting with a correction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The exporter-heavy index fell another 1.9% on Thursday, bringing its slide for the week up to nearly 7%. The FTSE 100 is nearly 10% below its recent closing high in mid-January.</p><p>Other indexes aren't far behind. In South Korea, the site of the largest outbreak outside China, the Kospi index is more than 9% off its recent January high. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 are also nearing correction territory.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, which has dropped in six of the past seven trading sessions, is 8% off an all-time high reached just last week.</p><p>Driving the market: A weakening outlook for global economic growth as countries race to contain the coronavirus' spread. Bank of America has cut its forecast for global growth to 2.8%, which would be the lowest reading since 2009.</p><p>The market unease also reflects the steady stream of companies warning that the coronavirus outbreak is hurting their business. Microsoft said Wednesday that it won't meet its revenue guidance issued in late January, citing weaker sales for Windows and Surface laptops. On Thursday, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, said it has lost $285 million in revenue in China due to the virus in January and February alone.</p><p>Goldman Sachs now estimates that US companies will generate no earnings growth in 2020. In the near term, the investment bank thinks that the S&amp;P 500 will fall another 7%.</p><p>Still dropping: The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, now below 1.30%, continues to hit new lows as investors seek out safe haven investments. </p><p>Oil has also continued its decline on concerns about waning demand in the event of a prolonged global slowdown. US oil futures are off another 2.3% to $47.61 per barrel, while Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, are down 2% to $52.34 per barrel.</p><p>Big picture: President Donald Trump's news conference and the US government response has not assuaged investors' anxiety as cases outside China continue to rise.</p><p>Apple will open its first store in India. Is it too late?</p><p>India is finally getting an Apple Store --- but the company could still find it hard to catch up in a crucial market for Big Tech. </p><p>The plans: The store will open in 2021, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. The iPhone maker also plans to launch online sales in India this year.</p><p>Why it took so long: Indian regulations require foreign retailers to source at least 30% of their raw materials locally. Apple has long sought an exemption from that rule and instead sold its devices through partner stores, my CNN Business colleague Michelle Toh reports. Cook told shareholders that the company \"needed to get approval from the government to go in there ourselves.\"</p><p>Apple has struggled for years to gain traction in the huge market. A big problem is price: A high-end iPhone can cost more than the country's average annual wage. Instead, Xioami and Samsung have dominated.</p><p>Apple finished 2019 in sixth place. The challenge for Cook will be leveraging a cheaper iPhone 11 to claw the company's way higher.</p><p>Its efforts come as Big Tech's honeymoon in India reaches an end. The country is making changes which could make it harder for global tech firms to cash in over the next decade. </p><p>What's happening: A raft of regulations in the works will affect how companies --- particularly foreign ones --- collect and store data, sell products online and protect their users' privacy.</p><p>How the coronavirus could spark a US recession</p><p>The longest economic expansion in American history has survived a trade war with China, a catastrophic tsunami in Japan and a severe crash in oil prices. The fast-moving coronavirus poses yet another grave test, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan writes.</p><p>Resilient spending by consumers kept the United States out of recession during the height of the trade war last year. Manufacturing collapsed. Business spending shrank. Yet Americans kept on shopping. The risk is that a health scare in the United States changes that balance.</p><p>\"If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told Matt.</p><p>Up next</p><p>Best Buy, J.C. Penney and Keurig Dr. Pepper report results before US markets open.AMC Entertainment, Beyond Meat and Dell will follow after the close.</p><p>Also today: The second estimate of US GDP for the fourth quarter arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET, plus durable goods orders for January.</p><p>Coming tomorrow: How did Americans' personal spending hold up heading into February's escalating coronavirus scare? </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The Competition and Markets Authority's digital advertising market study[2] largely came to similar conclusions (indeed, in places it reads as if the CMA worked backwards from those conclusions[3]).The Furman Report recommended that the UK should overhaul its competition regime with some quite significant changes to regulate the conduct of large digital platforms and make it harder for them to acquire other companies. But, while the Report's panel is accomplished and its tone is sober and even-handed, the evidence on which it is based does not justify the recommendations it makes.Most of the citations in the Report are of news reports or simple reporting of data with no analysis, and there is very little discussion of the relevant academic literature in each area, even to give a summary of it. In some cases, evidence and logic are misused to justify intuitions that are just not supported by the facts. </p><p>Killer acquisitions One particularly bad example is the report's discussion of mergers in digital markets. The Report provides a single citation to support its proposals on the question of so-called 'killer acquisitions' \u2014 acquisitions where incumbent firms acquire innovative startups to kill their rival product and avoid competing on the merits. The concern is that these mergers slip under the radar of current merger control either because the transaction is too small, or because the purchased firm is not yet in competition with the incumbent. But the paper[4] the Report cites, by Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer and Song Ma, looks only at the pharmaceutical industry.The Furman Report says that 'in the absence of any detailed analysis of the digital sector, these results can be roughly informative'. But there are several important differences between the drug markets the paper considers and the digital markets the Furman Report is focused on.The scenario described in the Cunningham, et al. paper is of a patent holder buying a direct competitor that has come up with a drug that emulates the patent holder's drug without infringing on the patent. As the Cunningham, et al. paper demonstrates, decreases in development rates are a feature of acquisitions where the acquiring company holds a patent for a similar product that is far from expiry. The closer a patent is to expiry, the less likely an associated 'killer' acquisition is.But tech typically doesn't have the clear and predictable IP protections that would make such strategies reliable. The long and uncertain development and approval process involved in bringing a drug to market may also be a factor.There are many more differences between tech acquisitions and the 'killer acquisitions' in pharma that the Cunningham, et al. paper describes. SO-called 'acqui-hires,' where a company is acquired in order to hire its workforce en masse, are common in tech and explicitly ruled out of being 'killers' by this paper, for example: it is not harmful to overall innovation or output overall if a team is moved to a more productive project after an acquisition. And network effects, although sometimes troubling from a competition perspective, can also make mergers of platforms beneficial for users by growing the size of that platform (because, of course, one of the points of a network is its size).The Cunningham, et al. paper estimates that 5.3% of pharma acquisitions are 'killers'. While that may seem low, some might say it's still 5.3% too much. However, it's not obvious that a merger review authority could bring that number closer to zero without also rejecting more mergers that are good for consumers, making people worse off overall. Given the number of factors that are specific to pharma and that do not apply to tech, it is dubious whether the findings of this paper are useful to the Furman Report's subject at all. Given how few acquisitions are found to be 'killers' in pharma with all of these conditions present, it seems reasonable to assume that, even if this phenomenon does apply in some tech mergers, it is significantly rarer than the ~5.3% of mergers Cunningham, et al. find in pharma. As a result, the likelihood of erroneous condemnation of procompetitive mergers is significantly higher.In any case, there's a fundamental disconnect between the 'killer acquisitions' in the Cunningham, et al. paper and the tech acquisitions described as 'killers' in the popular media. Neither Facebook's acquisition of Instagram nor Google's acquisition of Youtube, which FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra recently highlighted[5], would count, because in neither case was the acquired company 'killed.' Nor were any of the other commonly derided tech acquisitions \u2014 e.g., Facebook/Whatsapp, Google/Waze, Microsoft.LinkedIn, or Amazon/Whole Foods \u2014 'killers,' either.In all these high-profile cases the acquiring companies expanded the service and invested more in them. One may object that these services would have competed with their acquirers had they remained independent[6], but this is a totally different argument to the scenarios described in the Cunningham, et al. paper, where development of a new drug is shut down by the acquirer ostensibly to protect their existing product. It is thus extremely difficult to see how the Cunningham, et al. paper is even relevant to the digital platform context, let alone how it could justify a wholesale revision of the merger regime as applied to digital platforms.A recent paper[7] (published after the Furman Report) does attempt to survey acquisitions by Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. Out of 175 acquisitions in the 2015-17 period the paper surveys, only one satisfies the Cunningham, et al. paper's criteria for being a potentially 'killer' acquisition \u2014 Facebook's acquisition of a photo sharing app called Masquerade, which had raised just $1 million in funding before being acquired.In lieu of any actual analysis of mergers in digital markets, the Report falls back on a puzzling logic:To date, there have been no false positives in mergers involving the major digital platforms, for the simple reason that all of them have been permitted. Meanwhile, it is likely that some false negatives will have occurred during this time. This suggests that there has been underenforcement of digital mergers, both in the UK and globally. Remedying this underenforcement is not just a matter of greater focus by the enforcer, as it will also need to be assisted by legislative change.This is very poor reasoning. It does not logically follow that the (presumed) existence of false negatives implies that there has been underenforcement, because overenforcement carries costs as well. Moreover, there are strong reasons[8] to think that false positives in these markets are more costly than false negatives. A well-run court system might still fail to convict a few criminals because the cost of accidentally convicting an innocent person was so high.The UK's competition authority did commission an ex post review of six historical mergers in digital markets[9], including Facebook/Instagram and Google/Waze, two of the most controversial in the UK. Although it did suggest that the review process could have been done differently, it also highlighted efficiencies that arose from each, and did not conclude that any has led to consumer detriment. Recommendations The Report is vague about which mergers it considers to have been uncompetitive, and apart from the aforementioned text it does not really attempt to justify its recommendations around merger control.Despite this, the Report recommends a shift to a 'balance of harms' approach. Under the current regime, merger review focuses on the likelihood[10] that a merger would reduce competition which, at least, gives clarity about the factors to be considered. A 'balance of harms' approach would require the potential scale (size) of the merged company to be considered as well.This could give basis for blocking any merger at all on 'scale' grounds. After all, if a photo editing app with a sharing timeline can grow into the world's second largest social network, how could a competition authority say with any confidence that some other acquisition might not prevent the emergence of a new platform on a similar scale, however unlikely? This could provide a basis for blocking almost any acquisition by an incumbent firm, and make merger review an even more opaque and uncertain process than it currently is, potentially deterring efficiency-raising mergers or leading startups that would like to be acquired to set up and operate overseas instead (or not to be started up in the first place).The treatment of mergers is just one example of the shallowness of the Report. In many other cases \u2014 the discussions of concentration and barriers to entry in digital markets, for example \u2014 big changes are recommended on the basis of a handful of papers or less. Intuition repeatedly trumps evidence and academic research.The Report's subject is incredibly broad, of course, and one might argue that such a limited, casual approach is inevitable. In this sense the Report may function perfectly well as an opening brief introducing the potential range of problems in the digital economy that a rational competition authority might consider addressing. But the complexity and uncertainty of the issues is no reason to eschew rigorous, detailed analysis before determining that a compelling case has been made. Adopting the Report's assumptions \u2014 and in many cases that is the very most one can say of them \u2014 of harm and remedial recommendations on the limited bases it offers is sure to lead to erroneous enforcement of competition law in a way that would reduce, rather than enhance, consumer welfare. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20PolicyThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20Policyhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fthe-furman-report-is-a-flimsy-basis-for-a-new-uk-competition-policy%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Furman%20Report%20is%20a%20Flimsy%20Basis%20for%20a%20New%20UK%20Competition%20PolicyThe</url> post The Furman Report is a Flimsy Basis for a New UK Competition Policy[11] appeared first on Truth on the Market[12].

Many of my readers are of the conservative, income oriented variety. They're nearing retirement and have little to no desire to associate themselves with names/acronyms so closely associated with speculative growth.

Being that none of the F.A.N.G. names currently play a shareholder dividend, I can't blame investors who require a certain yield threshold from their investments for showing disinterest in these companies that don't meet their investment goals. If this is the investing mindset that you typically adhere to, I'll forewarn you now, this article is going to be of little interest to you However, there are two groups of readers who I think will benefit from reading this piece: the younger investors who follow my work with very long time horizons ahead of them in the markets and those individuals who hear F.A.N.G. and simply turn up their noses, as if these companies and all of the hype that surrounds them is nothing more than a scam driven by market hysteria and Jim Cramer's histrionics. Although I consider myself to be a dividend growth investor, I have exposure to a handful of non-dividend paying names. This was the discussion of my last piece here at Sure Dividend[3] and the editors have asked me to follow up with this piece, focusing on the famous (or notorious, depending on which side of the fence you find yourself on) F.A.N.G. names. Back in 2013, Jim Cramer began hyping the F.A.N.G. names after his colleague at RealMoney.com[4], Bob Lang, came up with the nickname for the four biggest growth stocks of the time: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG) (which has since changed its name to Alphabet). Here's what I believe to be the original article[5] breaking down the F.A.N.G. names. Say what you will about Cramer, but he certainly nailed this call. Let's take a look at F.A.N.G.'s massive out performance over the last 12 months. If you thought the broader indexes went on a run during 2017 then you'll be taken aback by F.A.N.G.'s performance. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Future-Dividend-Potential-Of-F.A.N.G..pngAlthough\">http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Future-Dividend-Potential-Of-F.A.N.G..pngAlthough</url> I've been an owner of several of these names for awhile now (admittedly, I didn't get behind the theme as early as Mr. Booyah himself). With that said, I was still surprised by the extent of their relative out performance during the past year or so. First of all, I never expect 40-50% total return in any 12-month period. Those expectations are just outlandish, regardless of the growth potential of a holding. What's more, 2017 was supposed to be the year of the Trump Rally, meaning financials and industrials were set to soar, not the big names from Silicon Valley whose social and political stances tend to lean left. With a couple of exceptions, Silicon Valley wasn't a friendly place for President Trump during the election and I think the F.A.N.G.'s out performance during the first year under a changing (and theoretically less-friendly regime) speaks volumes about the strong secular trends driving the growth of these names. But even more impressive than their 2017 returns are the 5-year returns produced by the F.A.N.G. names. As you can see below, anyone holding these stocks has done quite well for themselves since Mr. Lang and Mr. Cramer created the F.A.N.G. bandwagon.As I said in my prior piece here at Sure Dividend, after deciding to pursue a DGI strategy, it took years for me to diversify away from the traditional domestic dividend growers. I view my willingness to expand my horizons into international markets, as well as into non-dividend paying growth stocks when looking for growth, as a sign of maturity as a portfolio manager. I got pretty good at identifying DGI names that were trading at fair value or better. My returns early on were great using a basic DGI, buy and hold approach. Looking at my results alongside many of the other DGI success stories that I've been told, I have no doubt that this is a fine strategy for investors seeking financial freedom. However, as solid as my returns were in the market, they were not F.A.N.G.-like. I saw the massive runs that these big tech names were going on and the competitor in me wanted a piece of that action. For so long, I avoided the temptation to buy into these high growth names. I did my best to stick to the conservative roots that had been treating me so well. I bought into the mindset that these 'fabulous F.A.N.G.' stocks were massively overpriced and highly speculative assets. I used their valuation as an excuse to protect myself from the thin resentment that I tried to ignore when I spoke to others who who had bought a ticket to the F.A.N.G. ride and were having an amazing time. 'I'll wait for a pullback,' I said to myself. Well, this waiting game went on for years and I eventually realized that the market wasn't the irrational one, it was me. I was letting the conservative, DGI dogma that I had cut my teeth on as a young investor get in the way of probably the best opportunity for long-term wealth creation[6] that the market had in store for me. I didn't closely follow any of the F.A.N.G. names back in 2013 when the acronym was coined, but I wouldn't be surprised if they all weren't highly speculative on a fundamental basis at the time. The digital revolution as we know it today was just getting started and I don't think anyone had an accurate idea of just how powerful and disruptive these digital/mobile business models would be. However, flash forward to early 2016 when I began buying some of these names and their businesses had matured. Not only had they developed extraordinarily wide moats in growth industries with long runways ahead of them, but they had developed envious cash flows as well. So, let's start breaking down these companies individually. I'll also be discussing the speculative likelihood of shareholder returns (and especially dividends) when looking at the fundamentals, because while income is far from the forefront of my mind when looking at my F.A.N.G. exposure, I also wouldn't be totally surprised if 50 years from now, several, if not all of these four companies have evolved into dividend aristocrats[7].FacebookWhen I did my year end portfolio overview[8], Facebook comprised 1.91% of my portfolio, which was almost enough to allow it to crack my top 10 holdings (Facebook was my 11th largest position, behind Johnson and Johnson's 1.97% weighting). Facebook is my second largest F.A.N.G. position, behind Alphabet. I've built such a large Facebook position because of the intriguing valuation that I find here. I know that certain investors hear the F.A.N.G. acronym and assume that all four stocks are irrationally overpriced. Oftentimes we hear about Amazon's or Netflix's incredible, triple digit earnings multiples and this drives the F.A.N.G. narrative. However, this simply isn't the case for two of the four F.A.N.G. names. You'll never hear me attempt to make an argument for Amazon or Netflix being rationally valued by traditional valuation methods in the present. I don't own Netflix because I can't make sense of its valuation relative to its competitive position and its future growth prospects. And while I do have a relatively large position is Amazon, I didn't buy those shares because I was attracted to their valuation, but instead because I wanted exposure to the potentially world-beating, revolutionary behemoth that Jeff Bezos was building. But, when I bought shares of Facebook and Alphabet, it was because of their attractive valuations. Throughout 2016 and 2017, I actually believed that these two companies provided value oriented investors a couple of the most intriguing opportunities in the market. I always use forward earnings projects when evaluating equities, but this is especially important when I'm looking at high growth names because if I was to use ttm EPS figures, I would likely find multiples that weren't acceptable. When a company offers the market above average growth the market places a premium on it. Facebook has earned $4.47/share during the trailing 12 months, meaning that its ttm EPS is nearly 41x based upon its ~$180 share price. 40x is a lot to pay for any company, regardless of growth prospects. However, due to Facebook's unique bottom line growth outlook, we see that analyst expect to see EPS of $6.69 for the full year in 2018, meaning that Facebook's forward EPS multiple is less than 27x. In today's yield starved market, we've seen companies in the typically conservative ...fensive consumer staples and utility sectors trading with similar multiples. This is what originally drove me into the F.A.N.G.-type names. I couldn't justify paying 25-30x multiples for historically high quality companies (with slight, flat, and even negative top line growth projections) just because I was drawn to their reliably increasing yields. As a dividend growth investor I've had a real conundrum over the last few years as I've had to balance the value investor in me with my pursuit of financial freedom via my passive income stream. Even though I consider myself to be a dividend growth investor, I'm rarely willing to abandon my value based principles. Sure, I've allocated a small percentage of my portfolio to entirely speculative investments, but other than these trades, I think it's paramount that I target companies that are trading at fair or better values if I'm to meet my long-term management goals. I spoke about this in my prior piece here at Sure Dividend, but as a younger investor, my income stream isn't my sole priority in the markets; I pay a lot of attention to total return as well in an attempt to reach retirement as soon as responsibly possible. Because of this focus on value, I had to search elsewhere for potential investments with so many of the traditional DGI companies trading at what I believe to be irrational valuations because of the T.I.N.A. market that we've been living with; there is no alternative (to equities if you're looking for yield). Facebook posted top-line growth of 37.1%, 54.7%, 58.4%, 43.8%, and 54.2% during the years spanning 2012-2016, respectively. This is tremendous growth over a 5-year period and to me, represents a trend rather than a fad. Making matters even better for a somewhat conservative investor doing due diligence on Facebook shares, Facebook posted bottom-line growth that was even more impressive during this same period of time with annual EPS of $0.01, $0.60, $1.10, $1.29, and $3.49, respectively. It's clear to me that this company and its talented management team understand how to turn a profit while still growing the company's market share and widening its moat with ancillary products. One of the reasons that Facebook is so profitable is that it doesn't have a huge content spend like many of the other media platforms. The vast majority of Facebook's content is user generated (or even better, paid content created by advertisers). It's hard not to be attracted to this business model, which is much less capital intensive than its competitors in the media/video space. I recently published an article over at Seeking Alpha regarding my belief that Mark Zuckerberg should consider initiating a shareholder dividend[9]. That argument was based upon the fact that Facebook is relying on variables that are out of its control: population growth and infrastructure development that will allow further internet penetration world wide, for its future growth. For more in-depth analysis of this argument, please refer to the link above. I believe that Facebook still has a long growth runway ahead of its because it still has platforms to better monetize; however, I don't think investors should expect to see ~40-50% top-line growth over the long-term and my fear is that pricing premiums will contract, putting pressure on the company's share price. I offered a dividend as a way to counteract any multiple contraction due to slowing growth; my view is that a strongly growing dividend can serve as a buoy for companies to latch on to as they transition from the high growth phase to a more mature operation. Here's an excerpt from the Seeking Alpha piece[10] linked above with a specific focus on a potential dividend from Facebook: 'I think if Facebook initiated an annual dividend in the $2.70 range, representing a 1.5% yield at today's share price, and began increasing it ~10% annually, it would go a long way towards cushioning any blows from the multiple contraction associated with slowing top-line growth. A $2.70 dividend would represent a forward payout ratio of ~41. This is rather conservative and assuming that FB gave investors annual increases in the low-mid double digits (which would be more than acceptable to the vast majority of investors) this payout ratio would likely drop in the short-medium term while FB's bottom line growth outpaces dividend growth.' I stand by this initial ~$2.70 dividend suggestion; If Zuckerberg were to head down the dividend path, he would open up ownership of his stock to a much wider variety of shareholders (both retail and institutional) who're looking for yield. Because of Facebook's massive profits, I think this company is very well suited to be a dividend growth company and could potentially develop into an aristocrat over time. It does worry me that ~98% of Facebook's revenues come from digital advertising, but then again, traditional media companies have done quiet well over the years relying on advertising dollars, proving that this is a sustainable long-term business model (so long as you have the necessary eyeballs). But then again, without a doubt, Facebook has the necessary eyeballs. ~65% of the world's population (outside of China, where Facebook does not currently operate) uses a Facebook platform on a monthly basis.Amazon I won't spend nearly as much time delving into Amazon here at Sure Dividend because I highly doubt that this company will ever pay its shareholders a dividend. I don't even expect to see meaningful shareholder buybacks. Or, I should say, that I don't expect to see either of these two things as long as Jeff Bezos is in charge. They're simply not in his DNA. Mr. Bezos is all about growth. He's all about disruption. He's all about taking market share and dedicating money towards shareholder returns doesn't help him to achieve these goals. And you know what? I'm just fine with that. I don't think that there's a better CEO, or salesman, than Jeff Bezos on the planet. I oftentimes talk about buying management teams when I purchase stock and that is surely the case when it comes to Amazon. When you look at this company's fundamentals, it doesn't take long to realize that they're all over the place. Amazon has done an absolutely amazing job growing its top-line, but it has razor thin margins, which is typically something that I would avoid. Cash flows continue to rise but this growth isn't trickling down to the bottom line.Amazon isn't shy about entering into new markets and one could even make the argument that management doesn't always appear to be focused. But, with all of that being said, this company's growth is undeniable and I'm a shareholder because I believe in Bezos and I look forward to seeing just how big this thing can get before he's satisfied. I say that Bezos is the best salesman of all-time because somehow, he's managed to convince the market to give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to profitability for decades. Sure, he turned a small company selling books on the internet into a global retail powerhouse with best in class cloud and AI assets, strong content divisions, oh and in his spare time, he's building reusable space rockets; but, none of these accomplishment are more impressive than the leeway that he's convinced the markets to give him. I'm sure that just about every other CEO is completely jealous that Bezos and Amazon don't have to pursue profits. Instead, they can dedicate all of their energy (and cash) towards taking market share. This requires long-term thought and faith that isn't often granted in a market that is mostly concerned with quarter over quarter growth. As I said before, I don't see Bezos slowing down anytime soon. Amazon has made a habit of using innovative technology to disrupt any market/industry that appears to be bloated. In attempt to take market share, Amazon is willing to accept lower margins. Many view these undercutting tactics as anti-competitive, but I can hardly blame Bezos; instead, I blame the markets for continuing to place such a high premium on Amazon without bottom-line production. This is why my biggest fear regarding my Amazon position isn't valuation, but instead, government oversight and/or regulation. The vast majority of retail sales are still made at physical locations and I believe the cloud game is still in its early innings. This points towards room for ample growing moving forward in its primary markets (without factoring in continued disruption in ancillary spaces). However, Amazon's dominance in eCommerce has changed the perception of the game and I worry that many Americans (and politicians) already believe that Amazon (along with several of the other most powerful tech companies, including the other F.A.N.G. names) is becoming too powerful and should be either broken up or regulated. As a shareholder, I like the high tech conglomerate structure, giving Bezos the cash flows he requires to go after new markets. Amazon has several segments that would be attractive stand alone businesses, but I think the entire pie is a much more powerful force than the individual parts.NetflixNetflix is the only F.A.N.G. name that I don't personally own. Unlike the other companies included in this acronym, I've never been able to buy into this secular growth story. Actually, let me rephrase myself: I'm a big believer in the new age, mobile based, a la carte type of on demand content, but I don't believe that Netflix has created a moat strong enough to defend itself against its competition and therefore, I have a very hard time believing that this company deserves the multiple that the market has benevolently bestowed upon it. Disney[11] (DIS) is my second largest holding behind Apple[12] (AAPL), so that should go to show who I'm a believer in in the media/entertainment industry. What's more, AT...3] (T) is a top five holding of mine (needless to say, I'm bullish on the Time Warner acquisition) and I have a significant position in Comcast (CMCSA) as well. Honestly, I think what Netflix has done from an operational standpoint is very impressive. I'm even more impressed with the stock's performance. How could you not be? It's the best performing F.A.N.G. on both the 1-year and 5-year graphs. But, while I know there are very large future profit estimates floating about on the Street, I have a very hard time seeing those take place due to the costs that Netflix will incur as it continues to compete in a crowded industry for eyeballs. Unlike Facebook, which faces little notable competition in its most profitable market (North America), Netflix is battling for screen time with some of the richest and most powerful companies out there. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, the aforementioned Disney, Comcast, AT...and other behemoths, such as Verizon[14] (VZ) in the traditional media/distribution space. There has been so much consolidation in the media space as distribution companies look to diversify their revenue streams and differentiate their pipes from their competitors' by adding original content and your traditional production companies look to add distribution and/or alternative experiential products/services (theme parks, cruise ships, etc). We're witnessing a land grab for content right now with the AT...ime Warner and Disney/Fox deals. I believe that Netflix's growing power has inspired these deals. Without a doubt, Netflix was the first mover in the over the top content arena, but only time will tell if its brand and services will stand up to this intense showdown. Netflix is expected to produce an EPS of $1.25 for FY 2017 and $2.29 in FY 2018. If the company hits these analyst estimates, it will represent fantastic bottom-line growth, but the company is still a long way from having the necessary earnings to justify its current share price relative to other large media peers and FCF/share to pay a dividend. Netflixis trading for ~100x 2018 EPS projections. Disney and Comcast are trading for much less than 20x their forward looking figures. What's more, Netflix's ttm FCF/share is -$4.65. Netflix's FCF/share metric has actually been getting worse in recent years even though the company has grown sales and subscription metrics significantly. Even Amazon, who investors love to hate for its valuation, has produced fabulous FCF/share growth over the last 5 years or so (Amazon's FCF/share was just $0.87 in 2012 and its ttm FCF/share comes in at $14.71). I'd never bet against any of the F.A.N.G. names with a short position, but I also haven't been willing to give myself speculative exposure to this company's equity because of its unattractive fundamentals. Granted, this decision hasn't been a great one in recent years as Netflix continues to create wonderful wealth for its shareholders (on paper, at least), so feel free to take my bearishness here with a grain of salt. I think that Facebook has the potential to be a dividend aristocrat and I would say the same thing about Amazon if it wasn't for Mr. Bezos, but at the end of the day, I think Netflix simply faces too many risks. I have a very hard time imaging a scenario where this company pays a dividend or puts in place a significant buyback program, which is why I've decided to place my bets in the media/entertainment industry elsewhere.Google (which is now called, Alphabet) Alphabet is my third largest position, behind Apple and Disney, with a 4.96% weighting. It's by and large my biggest F.A.N.G. position, more than twice the size of second place, Facebook. Why? Because Alphabet is a wildly profitable company with an incredibly wide moat (albeit, with a somewhat narrow focus with regard to ~90% of sales/profits coming from digital ads) and a balance sheet to die for. I would say that Alphabet is probably the most mature company of the F.A.N.G. names. Alphabet is still in the habit of posting strong double digit top-line growth, but unlike several of the other high growth names, Alphabet is highly profitable, allowing conservative investors like me to evaluate it on a traditional P/E basis. Even after its massive run-up, from from ~$800 to $1,100 over the last year or so, Alphabet is only trading for ~27x 2018 EPS expectations. 27x isn't cheap, but it's not bad at all a company that is growing its bottom line in the 20% range. It's been awhile since I've added to my Alphabet position, which is already overweight. I liked the valuations I received in the $600's, $700's, and $800's better than the ones available to investors today; however, I'm still very bullish on this company's prospects long-term and I have no plans to sell my shares. When I look at the F.A.N.G. names, I think Alphabet is the second most likely, behind Facebook, to institute a shareholder dividend and become an eventual Dividend Aristocrat. Alphabet has a stronger financial position than Facebook at the moment, and a slightly more diversified revenue stream in the present, but I think Alphabet has some of the same DNA that I talked about regarding Amazon and Bezos, with a mind to solve problems outside of its current core competency, which could be capital intensive and potentially take away from shareholder returns. Alphabet is best known for its Google properties, where it dominates search and generates a ton of cash with digital ads; however, Alphabet is basically a venture capitalist firm with its 'other bets' category and operations in the cloud, AI, healthcare, automation (both of the home with hardware and driverless cars, with Waymo's software), just to mention a few. Alphabet's willingness to broaden its horizons and compete in various high growth areas of the tech sector seems to imply that the company is more interested in investing its cash flows in growth initiatives rather than shareholder returns. As a shareholder, I'm fine with this focus on growth, but I admit that this doesn't like bode well for more income oriented investors (at least, in the short-term). I'm really excited about Alphabet's autonomous vehicle potential, as well as some of the data driven work that the company is doing in the healthcare space. Search/digital ads will remain the cash cow for the foreseeable future, but I think Alphabet's growth runway is so impressive because of the investments that the company has made in other areas. Because of its dominant market position in the search space, I worry about government oversight/regulation. We've already seen Alphabet face issues in Europe about anti-competitive practices/tax issues and I expect that this trend will continue as foreign governments attempt to extract more cash from rich American companies. Alphabet has nearly $100b in cash on the balance sheet (much of which is held overseas) so I think we'll soon find out just how generous Alphabet's plans to be towards shareholders during the repatriation process. A large buyback/shareholder dividend would come as a surprise to me, but I don't think either is totally out of the question due to the large amounts of cash that Alphabet now has cheaper access to. What's more, this company has very little debt (just a tad bit less than $4b of long-term debt, according to Morningstar) meaning that paying down debt, which is something that I expect to see elsewhere in the corporate world, is not something that Alphabet management has to concern itself with moving forward.Thanks for reading this article.

Overtourism, racial bias, fee transparency and controlling the party crowd are also in the mix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the travel wreckage caused by the pandemic, home-sharing has emerged as battered, but with a steady pulse, as rental houses became social-distancing refuges for the travel-starved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Home rentals have outperformed hotels in 27 global markets since the onset of Covid-19, according to a report by the hotel benchmarking firm STR and the short-term rental analysts AirDNA. As leisure travel ticked up this summer, average daily rates were higher for rentals in July 2020 versus July 2019 in the United States - from about $300 to $323 - thanks to the popularity of larger homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, global restrictions have squeezed every aspect of the travel industry, including vacation rentals. Across home-sharing platforms, according to STR and AirDNA, occupancy fell by almost half between mid-March and the end of June to between roughly 33 and 36 percent, depending on the size of the rental (hotels by comparison fell to an average of 17.5 percent occupancy).</p><p>The biggest player in the short-term rental market, with more than 7 million listings in over 220 countries, is Airbnb. Over the years, its rampant growth and lack of transparency have made it a target for everything from charges of fueling overtourism and turning formerly residential neighborhoods into tourist zones to enabling raucous parties despite complaints and virus-related restrictions on gatherings.</p><p>After laying off a quarter of its work force in the spring, Airbnb jettisoned some new ventures, including forays into transportation and entertainment, and hunkered down to focus on its core strength, lodging, even as its valuation fell from a high of $31 billion to, recently, $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Now, as Airbnb prepares to go public, we talked to Airbnb's co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky, along with other industry experts, about some of the company's challenges and the ways it is changing travel.</p><p>\"People want to travel, they just don't want to get on airplanes,\" Mr. Chesky said. \"They don't want to go for business. They don't want to stay in the really big cities as prevalently as they used to. They don't want to be in crowded hotel districts.\" But, he said, \"they do want to get out of the house. And so we think demand is going to be strong in the future. I'm very optimistic, actually, about the industry.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lifestyle vs. vacation</emphasis></p><p>Airbnb has touted privacy and guests' control over their environment - including having your own kitchen in lieu of patronizing restaurants - as safeguards during the pandemic. It instituted new cleaning guidelines and indicated in late August that more than 1 million listings had earned the \"Enhanced Clean\" certification, which involves training in new guidelines that detail how and what to wash and sanitize. The procedures recommend 45 minutes of cleaning per room. Some listings guarantee a 72-hour vacancy window before check in.</p><p>The company says its offerings are aligned with the way people are traveling now, in family and friend groups to less populated destinations. Over Labor Day weekend, 30 percent of its bookings - double the previous year - were in remote areas, though classic vacation spots like HiltonHead Island, S.C., and Palm Springs, Calif., were among the most popular. Urban bookings remain down.</p><p>\"We're seeing a little blurring between traveling and living,\" Mr. Chesky said. \"Before the pandemic, you lived somewhere 50, 51 weeks of the year, and if you were so fortunate, you'd go on your once-or-twice-a-year vacation. Now the pandemic is changing how people want to work, travel and live.\" Remote school and work unbind families from their homes. \"People are living differently and people want to live anywhere,\" he added.</p><p>Whether travel truly turns into nomadism remains to be seen, though the average length of stay since May 1 increased 58 percent to more than four days, and fall bookings are stronger than usual, according to AirDNA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Overtourism, rising rents and housing shortages</emphasis></p><p>Cities around the world, from Barcelona to Vancouver, are looking to curb Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, which many blame for hollowing out neighborhoods as real estate managers took long-term leases and listed them as more lucrative short-term rentals.</p><p>\"You can earn more renting out apartments and houses on Airbnb than renting to locals,\" said David Wachsmuth, an associate professor in the School of Urban Planning at McGill University in Montreal. \"What's happened on their platform is that actual home-sharing is a fraction of the activity. It's dominated by commercial interests.\"</p><p>Research published in the Harvard Business Review found that as listings rise in a city, so do rents. Analyses by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found the costs to local communities of having Airbnb listings, including rising housing prices and shrinking availability, likely outweigh the benefits.</p><p>\"The problems of overtourism were in the making for a long time,\" said Makarand Mody, an assistant professor of marketing in the School of Hospitality Administration at Boston University. \"Airbnb came along and made it worse. It was seen as one evil that needs to be sorted out, but there are much deeper societal and economic issues. Airbnb is just the supply side. But demand has increased so much.\"</p><p>By 2019, the rise of the middle class globally contributed to expanding tourism above the rate of worldwide economic growth for nine years in a row, according to the World Travel &amp;amp; Tourism Council. In Airbnb, many travelers found affordable accommodations that allowed them to stay in neighborhoods rather than business centers.</p><p>Now that the pandemic is the ultimate overtourism disrupter, Mr. Chesky believes travel has been redistributed in a lasting way to places beyond bucket-list capitals. \"It's kind of redeemed our vision,\" he said. \"What I would love is to be able to help spread out travel to as many communities as possible rather than over-concentrating them in any one place.\"</p><p>\"My speculation is that the world does not quickly snap back to the way it was,\" he added. \"I don't think travel will ever, ever look like it did in January. The world can't change so dramatically like it has and then one of the industries that's been hit hardest just looks exactly like it did before.\"</p><p>Communities aim to ensure that. Last summer, Oahu enacted a law to restrict rentals without permits on the Hawaiian island, enforced with fines. In Europe, cities like Lisbon and Dublin are buying back leases or forcing landlords into long-term rentals in an effort to ensure that when tourism rebounds it won't overwhelm them again.</p><p>Enforcement remains thorny, and Airbnb has been accused of looking the other way when it comes to illegal listings. Last year, Los Angeles limited rentals to owner-occupied properties registered with the city, though many illegal units remain on the site, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>In response, Airbnb just launched a new City Portal that it says will allow governments to more easily identify listings that don't comply with local regulations, such as unregistered listings.</p><p>Before the launch, the company shared the new tool with San Francisco's Office of Short-Term Rentals. \"They're pretty positive about it and hopeful this will definitely improve their ability to get bad actors off the platform,\" said Jeffrey Cretan, a spokesman for the city's mayor.</p><p>Perhaps because of these scofflaws, Airbnb says it has not lost significant listings. According to AllTheRooms Analytics, among popular cities in Europe, only Rome and Lisbon have shed listings, about 2,000 each. In Lisbon, the crackdown still leaves just above 14,500 listings, the same figure as in January 2019, but down from the peak in July 2019.</p><p>The effect of more regulations may show up in the future, posing a threat to a robust portfolio. \"For a platform like Airbnb, they're not just worried about the demand side, but the supply side,\" Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said, noting the travel freeze may convince hosts to put their units in the long-term rental market, shrinking the platform, and worrying potential investors. \"When you're living on venture capital, profitability is not as important as growth,\" Mr. Mody added. \"Shareholders will be a lot less patient.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The music stops at party houses</emphasis></p><p>During the pandemic, Host Compliance, which tracks legal compliance among short-term rentals for 350 cities and counties in the United States, said noise complaints about so-called \"party houses\" tripled.</p><p>\"A lot of people have been at home for a long time and they have to let some steam off and can't jump on a plane to go to Europe or Canc\u00fan to party so they are renting out short-term rentals in driving distance from their homes,\" said Ulrik Binzer, the founder and general manager of Host Compliance.</p><p>Often, these rentals are in residential neighborhoods, triggering noise complaints and health concerns about large gatherings.</p><p>In Miami Beach, short-term rentals were closed this summer, though those within condo and apartment buildings were allowed to reopen, with capacity limits, in August. That month, the city of Los Angeles cut the power on a house (not an Airbnb property) rented by prominent TikTok stars during a large party.</p><p>In August, Airbnb pulled the plug, too, announcing a global ban on party houses, defined as those that persistently generate complaints from neighbors. The company says 73 percent of listings already ban parties, though hosts often allow small gatherings like baby showers and birthday parties. Occupancy is now limited to 16 people.</p><p>Airbnb imposed a similar restriction in Canada earlier this year after a party in Toronto ended in three shooting deaths, according to BBC News.</p><p>\"We want to do everything we can do to preserve the character of the communities and not allow these parties to get out of hand,\" Mr. Chesky said.</p><p>It's too soon, say observers, to know if the ban is working.</p><p>\"The issue with Airbnb party houses is enforcement,\" Mr. Binzer said. \"It's a little like having the fox watch the henhouse.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The $52 rental with a $125 cleaning fee</emphasis></p><p>On Sept. 14, a Twitter user wrote, \"Found a cheap @Airbnb for 52 dollars. Cleaning fee for 1 night, 125. Nonsense.\"</p><p>It's a typical complaint about the platform, which lists attractive nightly rates, but buries the fees until users begin booking. Cleaning and service fees can be modest - zero to $25, say - or add $450 to a booking, reflecting a mix of mandatory and optional host-applied fees. Sometimes there are additional occupancy taxes. And in some countries, Airbnb applies a Value Added Tax on its service fees.</p><p>Under Airbnb's pricing structure, hosts pay the company 3 percent of the booking subtotal, which includes the nightly rate plus any cleaning fee and fees for additional guests. Most guests are charged a service fee of less than 14.2 percent of the booking subtotal, which goes to Airbnb. (If hosts elect to cover the fee entirely, they normally pay Airbnb 14 to 16 percent of the subtotal.)</p><p>Because of their variability and lack of transparency, fees are the latest financial facet users have fixated on after the company created its extenuating circumstances policy during the pandemic. It said that travelers who had reservations made on or before March 14 could cancel and not be subject to cancellation fees, even if, in their rental agreement, they were in the penalty period. The policy has been extended several times, now to Oct. 31. (While most guests were happy with the resolution, many hosts were not and Airbnb later apologized to hosts for not consulting them).</p><p>Airbnb said it aims to introduce a redesign of price displays this year. \"We're trying to partner with hosts to create clear standards and change the search line, so if someone has higher cleaning fees, that affects their placement\" in search results, Mr. Chesky said. \"We've heard from travelers that they want a simpler way for us to show more of the price up front.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reckoning with racial bias</emphasis></p><p>Four years before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, igniting this summer's protests for social justice, the emergence of the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack called attention to a spate of racist incidents that users said happened at rental homes. Some Black renters were reported by neighbors as thieves. Others were subject to abuse by racist hosts rejecting their bookings. Complaints by Muslim, transgender and other groups followed.</p><p>Airbnb worked to purge discrimination from its platform by hiding guest's profile pictures until a booking is confirmed; hiring anti-discrimination specialists to audit the platform; and creating a reporting channel to identify listings not complying with its nondiscrimination policy. The company said it has removed 1.3 million offenders.</p><p>This month, Airbnb plans to launch Project Lighthouse, a research initiative in the United States that aims to measure bias through perception based on names and photos, to determine where and when bias happens on the platform, from booking through reviews.</p><p>According to the company, the study has been in the works for two years in partnership with the racial justice organization Color of Change, with input from several social justice nonprofits, including Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p><p>\"It's really hard to change what you can't measure,\" Mr. Chesky said. \"Then hopefully we will use this data to continue to evolve our platform and reduce the bias.\"</p><p>Its tech focus - on the platform rather than the in-person experience - won't address incidents of in-person bias. Through its existing Open Doors policy, Airbnb offers to find a guest an alternative place to stay if they feel they have been discriminated against by a host.</p><p>\"In a departure from its peers in Big Tech who pass off structural problems on the behavior of individual users, with Project Lighthouse, Airbnb is attempting to take responsibility for how tech platforms create the opportunity for harm at scale,\" wrote Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, senior campaigns director at Color Of Change, in an email.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experiences in the digital age</emphasis></p><p>Airbnb doesn't just rent lodgings. Through its Airbnb Experiences branch, it offers classes in mole making with an Indigenous cook in Mexico City, a music and cultural tour of Havana with a D.J. and walks among penguins with a conservationist in South Africa.</p><p>During the pandemic, many of its Experiences went virtual. Now, via Zoom, armchair travelers can visit an animal rescue farm in Connecticut, follow a plague doctor through Prague and sit in on a songwriting session in Nashville.</p><p>After Airbnb's layoffs, many wondered whether Airbnb Experiences, long rumored to be losing money, would be shelved, too. In January, it had 50,000 Experiences in 1,000 cities. During the pandemic, the division was shut down, and later transitioned, with a fraction of its offerings, online. Today, it has 700 virtual Experiences generating $2 million in bookings over the past five months. In-person Experiences have resumed in more than 70 countries with restrictions on group sizes, though the company declined to say how many Experiences are available in person and how much money they are making.</p><p>\"I would be surprised if they drop it completely,\" Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said. \"They don't want to be just a home rental company. Travel is about experiencing the destination in its entirety and they want to play a role in that.\"</p><p>The company said it stands by Experiences, even waiving its take - which is normally 20 percent - for its Social Impact Experiences, which include playing with shelter cats in Osaka, Japan ($25) and learning beat-making with an organization devoted to teaching underserved youth ($75).</p><p>\"Experiences was hit hard by social distancing,\" Mr. Chesky said, maintaining that the online transition has been successful. \"In a world where there's not a lot of things to do, we think there's a window for Airbnb Experiences,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow New York Times Travel </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">on</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

Overtourism, racial bias, fee transparency and controlling the party crowd are also in the mix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the travel wreckage caused by the pandemic, home-sharing has emerged as battered, but with a steady pulse, as rental houses became social-distancing refuges for the travel-starved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Home rentals have outperformed hotels in 27 global markets since the onset of Covid-19, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">report</url> by the hotel benchmarking firm STR and the short-term rental analysts AirDNA. As leisure travel ticked up this summer, average daily rates were higher for rentals in July 2020 versus July 2019 in the United States \u2014 from about $300 to $323 \u2014 thanks to the popularity of larger homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, global restrictions have squeezed every aspect of the travel industry, including vacation rentals. Across home-sharing platforms, according to STR and AirDNA, occupancy fell by almost half between mid-March and the end of June to between roughly 33 and 36 percent, depending on the size of the rental (hotels by comparison fell to an average of 17.5 percent occupancy).</p><p>The biggest player in the short-term rental market, with more than 7 million listings in over 220 countries, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Airbnb</url>. Over the years, its rampant growth and lack of transparency have made it a target for everything from charges of fueling overtourism and turning formerly residential neighborhoods into tourist zones to enabling raucous parties despite complaints and virus-related restrictions on gatherings.</p><p>After <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">laying off a quarter of its</url>work force in the spring, Airbnb jettisoned some new ventures, including forays into transportation and entertainment, and hunkered down to focus on its core strength, lodging, even as its valuation <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">fell from a high of $31 billion</url> to, recently, $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Now, as Airbnb prepares to go <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">public</url>, we talked to Airbnb\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky, along with other industry experts, about some of the company\u2019s challenges and the ways it is changing travel.</p><p>\u201cPeople want to travel, they just don\u2019t want to get on airplanes,\u201d Mr. Chesky said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go for business. They don\u2019t want to stay in the really big cities as prevalently as they used to. They don\u2019t want to be in crowded hotel districts.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthey do want to get out of the house. And so we think demand is going to be strong in the future. I\u2019m very optimistic, actually, about the industry.\u201d</p><p>Lifestyle vs. vacation</p><p>Airbnb has touted privacy and guests\u2019 control over their environment \u2014 including having your own kitchen in lieu of patronizing restaurants \u2014 as safeguards during the pandemic. It instituted new cleaning guidelines and indicated in late August that more than 1 million listings had earned the \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Enhanced Clean</url>\u201d certification, which involves training in new guidelines that detail how and what to wash and sanitize. The procedures recommend 45 minutes of cleaning per room. Some listings guarantee a 72-hour vacancy window before check in.</p><p>The company says its offerings are aligned with the way people are traveling now, in family and friend groups to less populated destinations. Over Labor Day weekend, 30 percent of its bookings \u2014 double the previous year \u2014 were in remote areas, though classic vacation spots like HiltonHead Island, S.C., and Palm Springs, Calif., were among the most popular. Urban bookings remain down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a little blurring between traveling and living,\u201d Mr. Chesky said. \u201cBefore the pandemic, you lived somewhere 50, 51 weeks of the year, and if you were so fortunate, you\u2019d go on your once-or-twice-a-year vacation. Now the pandemic is changing how people want to work, travel and live.\u201d Remote school and work unbind families from their homes. \u201cPeople are living differently and people want to live anywhere,\u201d he added.</p><p>Whether travel truly turns into nomadism remains to be seen, though the average length of stay since May 1 increased 58 percent to more than four days, and fall bookings are stronger than usual, according to AirDNA.</p><p>Overtourism, rising rents and housing shortages</p><p>Cities around the world, from Barcelona to Vancouver, are looking to curb Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, which many <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">blame</url> for hollowing out neighborhoods as real estate managers took long-term leases and listed them as more lucrative short-term rentals.</p><p>\u201cYou can earn more renting out apartments and houses on Airbnb than renting to locals,\u201d said David Wachsmuth, an associate professor in the School of Urban Planning at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened on their platform is that actual home-sharing is a fraction of the activity. It\u2019s dominated by commercial interests.\u201d</p><p>Research published in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Harvard Business Review</url> found that as listings rise in a city, so do rents. Analyses by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Economic Policy Institute</url>, a nonpartisan think tank, found the costs to local communities of having Airbnb listings, including rising housing prices and shrinking availability, likely outweigh the benefits.</p><p>\u201cThe problems of overtourism were in the making for a long time,\u201d said Makarand Mody, an assistant professor of marketing in the School of Hospitality Administration at Boston University. \u201cAirbnb came along and made it worse. It was seen as one evil that needs to be sorted out, but there are much deeper societal and economic issues. Airbnb is just the supply side. But demand has increased so much.\u201d</p><p>By 2019, the rise of the middle class globally contributed to expanding tourism above the rate of worldwide economic growth for nine years in a row, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">World Travel &amp;amp; Tourism Council.</url> In Airbnb, many travelers found affordable accommodations that allowed them to stay in neighborhoods rather than business centers.</p><p>Now that the pandemic is the ultimate overtourism disrupter, Mr. Chesky believes travel has been redistributed in a lasting way to places beyond bucket-list capitals. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of redeemed our vision,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I would love is to be able to help spread out travel to as many communities as possible rather than over-concentrating them in any one place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy speculation is that the world does not quickly snap back to the way it was,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think travel will ever, ever look like it did in January. The world can\u2019t change so dramatically like it has and then one of the industries that\u2019s been hit hardest just looks exactly like it did before.\u201d</p><p>Communities aim to ensure that. Last summer, Oahu enacted a law to <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">restrict rentals</url> without permits on the Hawaiian island, enforced with fines. <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">In Europe</url>, cities like Lisbon and <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Dublin</url> are buying back leases or forcing landlords into long-term rentals in an effort to ensure that when tourism rebounds it won\u2019t overwhelm them again.</p><p>Enforcement remains thorny, and Airbnb has been accused of looking the other way when it comes to illegal listings. Last year, Los Angeles limited rentals to owner-occupied properties registered with the city, though many illegal units remain on the site, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Los Angeles Times</url>.</p><p>In response, Airbnb just launched a new <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">City Portal</url> that it says will allow governments to more easily identify listings that don\u2019t comply with local regulations, such as unregistered listings.</p><p>Before the launch, the company shared the new tool with San Francisco\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Office of Short-Term Rentals</url>. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty positive about it and hopeful this will definitely improve their ability to get bad actors off the platform,\u201d said Jeffrey Cretan, a spokesman for the city\u2019s mayor.</p><p>Perhaps because of these scofflaws, Airbnb says it has not lost significant listings. According to AllTheRooms Analytics, among popular cities in Europe, only Rome and Lisbon have shed listings, about 2,000 each. In Lisbon, the crackdown still leaves just above 14,500 listings, the same figure as in January 2019, but down from the peak in July 2019.</p><p>The effect of more regulations may show up in the future, posing a threat to a robust portfolio. \u201cFor a platform like Airbnb, they\u2019re not just worried about the demand side, but the supply side,\u201d Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said, noting the travel freeze may convince hosts to put their units in the long-term rental market, shrinking the platform, and worrying potential investors. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living on venture capital, profitability is not as important as growth,\u201d Mr. Mody added. \u201cShareholders will be a lot less patient.\u201d</p><p>The music stops at party houses</p><p>During the pandemic, <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Host Compliance</url>, which tracks legal compliance among short-term rentals for 350 cities and counties in the United States, said noise complaints about so-called \u201cparty houses\u201d tripled.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people have been at home for a long time and they have to let some steam off and can\u2019t jump on a plane to go to Europe or Canc\u00fan to party so they are renting out short-term rentals in driving distance from their homes,\u201d said Ulrik Binzer, the founder and general manager of Host Compliance.</p><p>Often, these rentals are in residential neighborhoods, triggering noise complaints and health concerns about large gatherings.</p><p>In Miami Beach, short-term rentals were <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">closed</url> this summer, though those within condo and apartment buildings were allowed to reopen, with capacity limits, in August. That month, the city of Los Angeles <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">cut the power</url> on a house (not an Airbnb property) rented by prominent TikTok stars during a large party.</p><p>In August, Airbnb pulled the plug, too, announcing a global <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">ban on party houses</url>, defined as those that persistently generate complaints from neighbors. The company says 73 percent of listings already ban parties, though hosts often allow small gatherings like baby showers and birthday parties. Occupancy is now limited to 16 people.</p><p>Airbnb imposed a similar restriction in Canada earlier this year after a party in Toronto ended in three shooting deaths, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">BBC News</url>.</p><p>\u201cWe want to do everything we can do to preserve the character of the communities and not allow these parties to get out of hand,\u201d Mr. Chesky said.</p><p>It\u2019s too soon, say observers, to know if the ban is working.</p><p>\u201cThe issue with Airbnb party houses is enforcement,\u201d Mr. Binzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like having the fox watch the henhouse.\u201d</p><p>The $52 rental with a $125 cleaning fee</p><p>On Sept. 14, a Twitter user <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">wrote</url>, \u201cFound a cheap @Airbnb for 52 dollars. Cleaning fee for 1 night, 125. Nonsense.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a typical complaint about the platform, which lists attractive nightly rates, but buries the fees until users begin booking. Cleaning and service fees can be modest \u2014 zero to $25, say \u2014 or add $450 to a booking, reflecting a mix of mandatory and optional host-applied fees. Sometimes there are additional occupancy taxes. And in some countries, Airbnb applies a <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Value Added Tax</url> on its service fees.</p><p>Under Airbnb\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">pricing structure</url>, hosts pay the company 3 percent of the booking subtotal, which includes the nightly rate plus any cleaning fee and fees for additional guests. Most guests are charged a service fee of less than 14.2 percent of the booking subtotal, which goes to Airbnb. (If hosts elect to cover the fee entirely, they normally pay Airbnb 14 to 16 percent of the subtotal.)</p><p>Because of their variability and lack of transparency, fees are the latest financial facet users have fixated on after the company created its <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">extenuating circumstances policy</url> during the pandemic. It said that travelers who had reservations made on or before March 14 could cancel and not be subject to cancellation fees, even if, in their rental agreement, they were in the penalty period. The policy has been extended several times, now to Oct. 31. (While most guests were happy with the resolution, many hosts were not and Airbnb later <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">apologized</url> to hosts for not consulting them).</p><p>Airbnb said it aims to introduce a redesign of price displays this year. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to partner with hosts to create clear standards and change the search line, so if someone has higher cleaning fees, that affects their placement\u201d in search results, Mr. Chesky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from travelers that they want a simpler way for us to show more of the price up front.\u201d</p><p>Reckoning with racial bias</p><p>Four years before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, igniting this summer\u2019s protests for social justice, the emergence of the hashtag #<url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">AirbnbWhileBlack</url> called attention to a spate of racist incidents that users said happened at rental homes. Some Black renters were reported by neighbors as thieves. Others were subject to abuse by racist hosts rejecting their bookings. Complaints by Muslim, transgender and other groups followed.</p><p>Airbnb worked to purge discrimination from its platform by hiding guest\u2019s profile pictures until a booking is confirmed; hiring anti-discrimination specialists to audit the platform; and creating a reporting channel to identify listings not complying with its <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">nondiscrimination policy</url>. The company said it has removed 1.3 million offenders.</p><p>This month, Airbnb plans to launch <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Project Lighthouse</url>, a research initiative in the United States that aims to measure bias through perception based on names and photos, to determine where and when bias happens on the platform, from booking through reviews.</p><p>According to the company, the study has been in the works for two years in partnership with the racial justice organization <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Color of Change</url>, with input from several social justice nonprofits, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Asian Americans Advancing Justice</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</url>.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to change what you can\u2019t measure,\u201d Mr. Chesky said. \u201cThen hopefully we will use this data to continue to evolve our platform and reduce the bias.\u201d</p><p>Its tech focus \u2014 on the platform rather than the in-person experience \u2014 won\u2019t address incidents of in-person bias. Through its existing <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Open Doors policy</url>, Airbnb offers to find a guest an alternative place to stay if they feel they have been discriminated against by a host.</p><p>\u201cIn a departure from its peers in Big Tech who pass off structural problems on the behavior of individual users, with Project Lighthouse, Airbnb is attempting to take responsibility for how tech platforms create the opportunity for harm at scale,\u201d wrote Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, senior campaigns director at Color Of Change, in an email.</p><p>Experiences in the digital age</p><p>Airbnb doesn\u2019t just rent lodgings. Through its <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Airbnb Experiences</url> branch, it offers classes in <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">mole making</url> with an Indigenous cook in Mexico City, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">music and cultural tour of Havana</url> with a D.J. and <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">walks among penguins</url> with a conservationist in South Africa.</p><p>During the pandemic, many of its Experiences went <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">virtual</url>. Now, via Zoom, armchair travelers can visit an <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">animal rescue farm</url> in Connecticut, follow a <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">plague doctor through Prague</url> and sit in on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">songwriting session</url> in Nashville.</p><p>After Airbnb\u2019s layoffs, many wondered whether Airbnb Experiences, long rumored to be losing money, would be shelved, too. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">January</url>, it had 50,000 Experiences in 1,000 cities. During the pandemic, the division was shut down, and later transitioned, with a fraction of its offerings, online. Today, it has 700 virtual Experiences generating $2 million in bookings over the past five months. In-person Experiences have <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">resumed</url> in more than 70 countries with restrictions on group sizes, though the company declined to say how many Experiences are available in person and how much money they are making.</p><p>\u201cI would be surprised if they drop it completely,\u201d Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be just a home rental company. Travel is about experiencing the destination in its entirety and they want to play a role in that.\u201d</p><p>The company said it stands by Experiences, even waiving its take \u2014 which is normally 20 percent \u2014 for its <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Social Impact Experiences</url>, which include <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">playing with shelter cats</url> in Osaka, Japan ($25) and learning <url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">beat-making</url> with an organization devoted to teaching underserved youth ($75).</p><p>\u201cExperiences was hit hard by social distancing,\u201d Mr. Chesky said, maintaining that the online transition has been successful. \u201cIn a world where there\u2019s not a lot of things to do, we think there\u2019s a window for Airbnb Experiences,\u201d he said.</p><p>Follow New York Times Travel on<url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Instagram</url>,<url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Twitter</url> and<url normalizedValue=\"https://str.com/whitepaper/covid-19-impact-on-hotels-and-short-term-rentals-airdna\">Facebook</url>.

(BBVA) has issued the following press release:     The Money20/20 Asia conference, which was held last week in Singapore, is all about uncovering the future of financial services.  As you would expect, the big banking providers are often on show, explaining how they will deliver for their customers and clients in the future. But quite often, the most interesting indicators of how the banking sector will develop are to be found from peripheral companies \u2013 those startups for whom innovation is a life or death business.  For the startup community, big conferences \u2014and while the organizers of Money20/20 Asia have not released any official figures, it was certainly several thousands in attendance\u2014 are a chance to meet potential customers, investors and collaborators. </p><p> In fact it is precisely for that reason that BBVA goes along. As a bank that has a worldwide reputation for leading digital banking and working with the fintech community in true partnership \u2013 BBVA gets the chance to begin and build relationships with those on the cutting edge of future financial services.  This the bank did last week, meeting everyone from biometric identity providers and AI chatbot businesses to personal investment businesses that use social media as a way to gauge your risk profile and huge progressive investment firms who are eyeing potential partners to create with.  BBVA also took the opportunity to be a provocateur \u2013 with the Bank\u2019s Global Head of Customer and Client Solutions, Derek White, delivering a keynote address entitled \u201cCan banks be a threat to Big Tech\u201d. The purpose was to demonstrate how BBVA is shifting both its business model, and its processes and structure, to bring in customer focused products that marry up data and money together, in a user friendly way, to give more value to customers and clients.  BBVA also gave exposure to some of the startups who had been through the Open Talent fintech startup competition, bringing four previous finalists, including last year\u2019s winner Change, over to Singapore to help them increase their presence and win new business.  How to protect digital identities  The bank also participated in a dedicated panel session on future digital identities, where the fundamental question was how do we build robust systems for securely protecting, and validating identity in an age that is shifting from face to face interactions to purely digital. The questions posed were should it be managed as a closed system run by Governments, or a more open system managed by businesses like banks where regulation dictates strong proof checking. Or indeed should it shift to a decentralized model where the individual holds their own identity and blockchain is used as a key code to validate.  Perhaps one of the more interesting angles that came from the three-day event was where and how other industries are moving into banking. It has been known for a long time that the likes of Amazon and Facebook are moving into the sector \u2013 Facebook for example recently secured approval for an e-banking license in Ireland.  Although one interesting development from the conference was a statement from Diana Layfield from Google that this Big Tech player had no intention of becoming a bank \u2013 and that its focus was on working with banks and fintechs to build their future. However one big business that did launch a bank at the event, was Air Asia, the low costs SE Asia carrier started by entrepreneur Tony Fernandes \u2013 who gave the conference\u2019s closing address.  Air Asia has founded its own independent startup bank called Big Pay, that looks to leverage the data it gets from its customers, to provide them with tailored banking services. Returning to the theme White delivered \u2013 the power of data to improve customers lives and add value \u2013 Air Asia and Big Pay are banking that the value their customers give them in terms of flights taken, spending patterns, and of course everything transacted in their airplanes\u2019 cashless cabins \u2013 to find their unique selling point.  Derek White, said: \u201cFor me, the big three themes coming out of the event were the blurring of industry lines, the increasing value and focus on data, how we manage future, fluid, digital identities, and most of all the partnerships that will be created between big players and the new kids on the block\u201d.  The BBVA\u2019s Global Head of Customer and Client Solutions said too that\u2019s \u201cgreat news for BBVA\u201d, because the bank has been focused on precisely those topics for some time now. \u201cThings like the ecosystem we have built, the award winning products and services we are delivering, and our strong commitment to fostering partnership with fintech, demonstrate just that.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear the future of financial services will involve more than just banks \u2013 but that ultimately is great news for banks, partners, regulators, and most importantly our customers and clients.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN679025220180320</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXF-FFB1-J9XT-P2S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's the Angry Retail Banker here! I'm taking a break from offering 'An Insider's Take On Retail Banking' because the good people here at Modest Money begged me on their hands and knees to come here and talk to you guys about investing in financial equities (you can't prove they didn't). What I really wanted to do is give my thoughts on the future of bank stocks, and whether they will be a good long term investment for 10-20 years from now and beyond. After all, technology is changing and disrupting traditional banks and financial institutions. </p><p>Will banks still be the same decades from now as they are today? Will the banking sector still be massively profitable? Will the same banks still rule the financial space?The View From The Ground UpNow remember that I am a branch banker. The only thing that makes me different from all the employees at all the other bank branches is that I'm the only one that decided to complain about the job on the Internet. But opening savings account and trashing customers on the Internet doesn't make me a financial analyst. It doesn't make me an expert on emerging fintech (financial technology). It doesn't make me a banking or technology futurist. But it does give me a unique perspective on the situation that the analysts and futurists don't have. I've actually had this subject on my mind for awhile. In my article 'Customer Experience And Retail Banking: Why Banks Need To Enter The Modern World[1]', I discussed a day where my district manager came to show us the ABSOLUTE IMPORTANCE OF LOBBY LEADERSHIP!!!!!!! I was rather underwhelmed by its importance, but overwhelmed by the fact that the banks were all putting such a heavy focus on greeting customers at the door and making each trip to the bank 'an experience'. You can read the article for my full commentary (tl;dr: I think it's stupid), but it did make me think about how banks will adapt and change to shifting demographics, emerging technology, small startups and large tech companies suddenly becoming major competitors, and how this will all affect the profitability and investibility (is that a word?) of bank stocks in the future. I think I was supposed to be thinking of better and more exciting ways to greet the customer, use their names, and 'take ownership of the experience' (whatever that's supposed to mean). I'm such a rebel.Banks Are Slow To ChangeOne of the downsides of the future of banks\u2014and one of the things that might compel someone to avoid bank stocks\u2014is that they are slow to change. They are loathe to change. Part of this is for good reason. Banks have so many regulations and regulatory bodies watching them, it's ridiculous. Whether you support the regulations or whether you champion deregulation, it's no secret that banking and finance is a highly regulated industry. Other businesses are trying to please their customers. Banks are trying to please their regulators. Because customers don't issue multi-million dollar fines on banks when they don't get what they want. Banks also have a very dangerous business model to a degree. The make money on loans. Their primary method of making money is to hand someone they've never met tens of thousands of dollars, wave to them as they walk out the door, and hope that they see this person again to get their money back. At the same time, banks have been very profitable for hundreds and hundreds of years. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been operating continuously since 1472[2] and banking is much, much older than that. So do you think banks would be so willing to change their ways? Banks are in the business of measuring risk. And as such, they are very risk adverse. And change invites risk. The risk of moving away from business practices that have generated centuries of stable and lucrative profits. The risk of running afoul of regulators. The risk that customers won't adapt to the new changes and will want to do what they've been doing since the days of the earliest merchant banks. And so the end result is that banks lack a culture of innovation[3] and change, because it's more profitable and less risky to just stay the course. Why change what's worked for centuries? That last link was to an article by prominent bank futurist Jim Marous, co-founder of The Financial Brand and author of The Digital Banking Report. He spends a lot of time talking about the future of banking, specifically in regards to technology. And technology evolves at an exponential pace. Whereas it took hundreds of years for the first major piece of revolutionary technology to hit the banking world by storm (the ATM, which was first used in the US in 1969[4] by Chemical Bank and introduced in the UK two years earlier), now we have online and mobile banking invented within the same decade or so, and AI chatbots, IoT, and other technological revolutions on the way. Technology evolves exponentially. Ironically, given the topic, it's like an interest rate. It compounds, with one technological innovation building to the next. Now a new revolutionary technology that changes the way banking is done comes out every few years, rather than every few decades like in the previous century (and every few centuries in the time before that). Combine that with a growing customer base that sees technology as a figurative extension of themselves, and you now have an industry that may be in peril. You can't rest in your centuries-old traditions, not in today's world. Adapt or die. That doesn't bode well for bank investors, right? So I must think that banks are a bad place to invest, right? Well, I'm not done yet!A New Challenger Has Entered The Battle!Businesses always have competition within their field. Banks are no exception. Banks compete with other banks to provide their services to the global market. Chase tries to outdo Wells Fargo by offering a lower rate on a mortgage, Wells Fargo tries to outdo Citibank by opening fake accounts[5], so on and so forth. Except now, with fintech growing at a record pace, banks face competition from small fintech companies and major technology giants such as Google and Apple. This is competition from players banks never thought they'd have to compete with in a space they never thought they'd have to compete in. Small fintech startups seem to be popping up every other week and represent the sort of 'small company taking on the big corporate giant' stories that make Americans cry red, white, and blue apple pie tears. Whereas small mom and pop coffee shops will never take down a Starbucks, a small fintech firm can disrupt the entire financial industry with a new technology that makes the banks' products and services obsolete. They are also fast and nimble enough, being small companies and not large mega-corporations with various departments that every idea must be filtered through and approved by, to change and adapt to the needs of their customers right away. We've seen companies like Lending Club take the world of lending and investing by storm with their peer-to-peer lending services. LendingTree has changed the way people shopped for mortgages, and LendKey is fast becoming a leader in student loans by acting as a broker for not-for-profit lenders and providing full after-funding services. I wrote a review about LendKey here[6]. For non-lending companies that aren't brought to you by the letter 'L', there's PolicyGenius (an online life insurance broker). There's Acorns, a 'micro investment' company that takes each of your debit card purchases, rounds them up to the nearest dollar, and invests the spare change into your investment portfolio. And of course, there's PayPal, the legendary online payments/money transfer company. There's countless fintech firms springing up in different areas of finance (lending, investments, payment solutions, etc). These were considered by Entrepreneur to be the 12 top fintech companies to watch[7] out for, but there's way too many to count. Each of them are taking something that traditional financial institutions have done for generations (banks as well as insurance companies or investment firms) and are doing it better. And countless customers are moving towards these companies. They are disrupting the industry, creating a new game field with new key players. Of course, the fintech firms aren't even the largest future competitors! Ironically, it's non-financial technology giants that pose the greatest threat to the future of traditional banks! The financial industry sees Google and Amazon as a bigger threat to retail banking[8] than fintech companies and new banks, and it makes a surprising amount of sense when you stop to think about it for a few minutes. As we said before, banks are slow to change and innovate. The tech companies are on the extreme opposite end of that spectrum. They must innovate if they want to still be around the next year. They must innovate and improve and come out with the Next Big Thing before the competition does. Now that may sound scary for a tech investor. Historically, I've always avoided tech stocks for that reason. But with technology being the future centerpiece of the financial industry, that constant innovation will be the key for survival. The slow, stodgy banks will have to change their culture from one of legacy and tradition to one of fast paced change and innovation. As long as the image of marble columns and oak desks comes into your mind when you think of a bank, rather than sleek tablets and large flat screen monitors like when you think of a tech firm, banking will always lack the necessary ingredient to survive in a rapidly advancing technological world.Why I Think Bank Stocks Are A Great Future InvestmentAfter all this, you probably are about ready to sell off every bank stock you have. Sure, you've researched the safest banks to invest in[9] and only have your money in banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test. But after reading this, you're about ready to sell all your bank stocks. Hell, you're closing your accounts as we speak, you're so freaked out. But actually, I am as bullish as ever on bank stocks as a long term investment. Is it because I need you guys to invest to prop up the industry for as long as possible so I don't lose my job? Ha! I'll take the unemployment at this point, I don't care. No, I'm bullish on banks because I think that they will adapt, in their own unique way. Banks have been slow to change, but they have done it and are doing it at a faster rate. Right now, if you walk into any bank branch, you will be pushed towards mobile banking. You will see ads all around advertising the convenience of mobile deposits. There is a reason for this. Banks are recognizing that Millennial customers value user-friendly technology over in-branch service. Not my bank, of course. My bank still thinks we can differentiate ourselves by 'being nicer' than the competition. 'Being nicer' translates to getting all in your face and shaking your hand and using everyone's names the second you walk into the bank. I find that obnoxious, personally. But it must also be understood that fintech companies are still small startups. They may 'disrupt' the banking sector, but 'disruption' isn't the same as 'ending'. FlyWire isn't about to put Bank of America out of business because it offers cheaper international wire transfers. And that leads me to my next point. Bank of America is one of FlyWire's partners. They proudly put that right on their homepage[10]. This is the norm. Fintechs have been, for the most part, partnering with the big banks rather than competing with them. It makes sense. The banks have the capital, global reach, and brand recognition that these small companies just don't have. So instead, they partner up with the banks to ensure that their products are used by millions of customers worldwide, offered through the banks. And the banks are thrilled; they get that technological innovation necessary to compete without having to actually do it themselves. Small fintech companies just can't compete with the banks. Or more accurately, whatever strengths they do possess are outweighed by their lack of resources and reach. Lending Club and PayPal aren't putting Chase out of business anytime soon. But by partnering, the fintech firms suddenly have access to a global financial institution that will provide the tools and resources needed for their tiny business to succeed, and banks will suddenly find themselves with access to the technology and outside-the-box thinking they need to adapt to in order to survive in tomorrow's banking arena. And, of course, the banks are so big that they will also just buy out these fintech firms. If TransferWise is so profitable and eating into the banks' market share, Barclay's or HSBC could just buy them out. Banks buy out other banks all the time. That's actually my biggest fear in buying regional bank stocks[11]. The idea of banks buying out their fintech competitors is pretty reasonable. As for the big tech companies, while they've come out with their own products such as Google Pay and Apple Pay, they've either partnered with the banks in providing financial technology like the fintech firms did or they've avoided dipping their toes too heavily in the financial pool. Finance, unlike technology, is a heavily regulated industry. Regulations are stifling to innovation, and that can cripple technology companies. Tech companies, like any other, want to stay in their core business. Look at the hit General Electric took during the recession because most of its revenue was coming from GE Capital (now Synchrony Financial) instead of its appliances, engines, and the like. I think that, in spite of the issues I discussed before, banks are a great long term investment for those looking to grow their money over the next 20-30 years. Banks may be slow to innovate in a sector that's shifting towards exponential technological growth, but it's not like they never have. Banks weren't created in a vacuum; they evolved to what they are today, changing and adapting to different political and economic climates. Their competitors in the technology space are small startups who are either potential partners or buying opportunities, and tech giants who would be loathe to enter the regulator maze of the financial realm. A few decades from now, the big banks that dominate the S...00 will be the same ones that dominate the S...00 today, except that they will be offering branchless banking, P2P lending, and instant international mobile payments in their product/service lineup. Banking will change, but bank stocks won't. You'll still be buying shares of Wells Fargo and HSBC on the stock exchange. You just won't have to deal with me anymore when it comes time to move your money. Author Bio:\u00a0Angry Retail Banker is a licensed banker who works at a branch of\u00a0[REDACTED].

Which means, according to Charif Hamidi, founder of edtech startup Ed4.0 - an education social enterprise committed to removing barriers to high-quality, free education for children worldwide - there has never been a better time for edtech entrepreneurs to shine, particularly those who have developed technology to head into 2021 with distanced-based solutions. Verdict spoke to three such edtech startups, all of whom have found themselves gravitating to vibrant tech ecosystems in places such as the UAE's capital, Abu Dhabi. While many nations have found themselves with students falling behind and unable to keep up - again according to UNESCO - countries such as the UAE (with a flexible regulatory framework and a rapid approach to implementing change) are adjusting well to the post-Covid-19 education world. </p><p>\"Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a promising hub for startups across industries,\" Hamidi explains. \"It's not just for education or edtech. What Abu Dhabi offers is a combination of public and private initiatives that provided Abu Dhabi with a solid infrastructure and an entrepreneurial ecosystem that in turn has proven to be quite attractive to entrepreneurs worldwide and across sectors. The education technology sector stands in the forefront of the most boisterous sectors in Abu Dhabi.\" Teacherly is a UK-founded edtech startup that focuses on training teachers in skills that allow them to work remotely. Founder Atif Mahmood has said that the interactive platform, which allows teachers to collaborate worldwide and lesson plan, has seen a huge amount of growth since opening up a second branch in Abu Dhabi. Mahmood points to the networking he's done since being part of Abu Dhabi's tech ecosystem, Hub71. \"I'm a single founder - I'm not an expert in everything - and I need the best people around me who are experts in their particular field,\" Mahmood explains via Zoom. \"When I came on a scouting trip to Abu Dhabi and saw the incredible networking - not just meet-and-greets, but real meeting of minds with actual outcomes - I knew we needed to be a part of this. \"Microsoft is a partner and has been a huge supporter of us. We have a great partnership with them now because of Abu Dhabi and Hub71. And I think before that it would be difficult to get Microsoft's attention as a small startup.\" Anjal Z, Abu Dhabi's edtech accelerator (which is run by the Abu Dhabi Early Childhood Authority), operates a programme specifically for edtech startups. Recently, it provided five startups with eight weeks of intense training and mentorship. Top-performing startups that demonstrate a strong expansion strategy and progress in the UAE qualify for $100,000 in non-equity grant money, in-kind services and follow-on investments. The startups are Mexico-based Kinedu, UK-based Nurturey and Kinderly, Guatemala-based Afinidata and UAE-based Lamsa - all of which have now benefitted from the Gulf country's commitment to research and development and educational technology. Badr Ward, CEO of the UAE's home-grown award-winning Arabic-language educational app, Lamsa, told Verdict that he's received more enquiries from regional and international investors than ever before, both due to the changing landscape of education post-Covid-19 and because of his integration with Hub71's network. He explains: \"We've been able to easily communicate with relevant government entities; build a true sense of community and solve big tech problems through regular discussions with fellow colleagues within the industry to learn from their experiences. For years I was telling everyone that Abu Dhabi is great, but people felt it was too far away. Now, the conversation has changed, they say 'tell me more, when can I come visit?'\" \"I really do wish for the fast recovery of school systems,\" continues the CEO, \"but after this crisis, the role of teachers and technology will change and the whole world will come to realise that remote learning is not just a 'nice to have'.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-48D7D915437B42C8A5F7C5AC435303DE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C4-J101-DYG0-72VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

While teachers have had to quickly amend most of their curricula to an online format, students and parents who aren\u2019t lucky enough to have schools open in their area have had to take a crash course in home-learning. Which means, according to Charif Hamidi, founder of edtech startup Ed4.0 \u2013 an education social enterprise committed to removing barriers to high-quality, free education for children worldwide \u2013 there truly has never been a better time for edtech entrepreneurs to shine, particularly those who have developed technology to head into 2021 with distanced-based solutions.    Verdict [change as necessary] spoke to three such edtech startups, all of whom have found themselves gravitating to vibrant tech ecosystems in places such as the UAE\u2019s capital, Abu Dhabi, which may not spring immediately to mind when thinking of educational advancements. While many nations have found themselves with students falling behind and unable to keep up \u2013 again according to UNESCO \u2013 countries such as the UAE (where a flexible regulatory framework and a rapid approach to implementing change) are adjusting well to the post-Covid-19 education world.    \u201cAbu Dhabi has positioned itself as very much of a promising hub for startups across industries,\u201d Hamidi explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for education or edtech. What Abu Dhabi offers is a combination of public and private initiatives that provided Abu Dhabi with a solid infrastructure and an entrepreneurial ecosystem that in turn has proven to be quite attractive to entrepreneurs worldwide and across sectors. The education technology sector stands in the forefront of the most boisterous sectors in Abu Dhabi.\u201d    The first of them, Teacherly, is a UK-based edtech startup that focuses on training teachers in skills that allow them to work remotely and founder Atif Mahmood has said that the interactive platform, which allows teachers to collaborate worldwide and lesson plan for much less, has seen a huge amount of growth since opening up a second branch in Abu Dhabi. Mahmood points to the networking he\u2019s done since being part of Abu Dhabi\u2019s tech ecosystem, Hub71.    \u201cI\u2019m a single founder \u2013 I\u2019m not an expert in everything \u2013and I need the best people around me who are experts in their particular field,\u201d Mahmood explains via Zoom. \u201cWhen I came on a scouting trip to Abu Dhabi and saw the incredible networking \u2013 not just meet-and-greets, but real meeting of minds with actual outcomes \u2013 I knew we needed to be a part of this.    \u201cMicrosoft is a partner and has been a huge supporter of us. We have a great partnership with them now because of Abu Dhabi and Hub71. And I think before that it would be difficult to get Microsoft\u2019s attention as a small startup.\u201d    AnjalZ, Abu Dhabi\u2019s edtech accelerator, operates a programme specifically for edtech startups. Recently, it provided five startups with eight weeks of intense training and mentorship. Top-performing startups that demonstrate a strong expansion strategy and progress in the UAE have $100,000 in non-equity grant money, in-kind services and follow-on investments. The startups are Mexico-based Kinedu, UK-based Nurturey and Kinderly, Guatemala-based Afinidata and UAE-based Lamsa \u2013 all of which have now benefitted from the Gulf country\u2019s commitment to research and development and educational technology.    Badr Ward, CEO of the UAE\u2019s home grown Arabic-language educational app, Lamsa, told Verdict [change as necessary] that he\u2019s received more enquiries from regional and international investors than ever before, both due to the changing landscape of education post-Covid-19 and because of his integration with Hub71\u2019s network.    He explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to easily communicate with relevant government entities; build a true sense of community and solve big tech problems through regular discussions with fellow colleagues within the industry to learn from their experiences. For years I was telling everyone that Abu Dhabi is great, but people felt it was too far away. Now, the conversation has changed, they say \u2018tell me more, when can I come visit?\u2019\u201d    \u201cI really do wish for the fast recovery of school systems,\u201d continues the CEO, \u201cbut after this crisis, the role of teachers and technology will change and the whole world will come to realise that remote learning is not just a \u2018nice to have\u2019.\u201d    The post appeared first on Verdict .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42585130696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BN-Y721-F07F-828B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Verdict.co.uk</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

This amount is double from this time last year. The funds themselves have outperformed non-ESG funds during the global recession caused by the pandemic[2].[1][3]   Get The Full Ray Dalio Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Ray Dalio in PDF.

Munger started his investment career in the 1960s when, Read More[5]   This reality intersects with an increasing commitment by firms throughout Latin America to align their practices with globally accepted ESG standards[6]. Ample opportunity in Latin America exists and will continue to expand for investors. What Is ESG?While there is no one accepted definition, ESG is used interchangeably with sustainable investing and socially responsible investing. MSCI - a global provider of sector indexes - describes ESG as 'the consideration of environmental, social and governance factors alongside financial factors in the investment decision-making process.' Environmental issues focus on the impacts of climate change and human intervention on natural capital. Social concerns regard human rights, child labor forced labor, workplace conditions, and management-worker relations. Governance refers to how firms are managed, specifically bribery and corruption, executive pay, board diversity, political lobbying and donations, and tax strategy. The Principles for Responsible Investment, which partners with the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the UN Global Compact, and the OECD - an international intergovernmental economic organization of 37 countries - have issued sets of guidelines to help facilitate the integration of ESG policies for investors and firms.[2][7] There were $31 trillion in sustainable investments in the beginning of 2019 and Bank of America believes there may be $20 trillion growth in ESG assets over the next two decades. As a sign of the times, BlackRock Capital in June launched four ESG ETFs and filed to create two more, making good on a January pledge by CEO Larry Fink. Jeff Ubben, founder of the $16 billion hedge fund ValueAct, recently departed to create the ESG-minded Inclusive Capital Partners.[3][8]Latin America and ESGWith this accelerating shift underway, the future of ESG investing in Latin America is now at hand. Companies are increasingly integrating international ESG best practices and regional institutions are creating indexes listing the firms that exhibit the best qualities of transparent corporate governance, responsible stewardship of resources, and non-depredatory policies targeting the region's natural capital. The institutional support encourages corporate behavior, creating a positive feedback loop.[4][9] The IndexAmericas is such an example. The Inter-American Development Bank and IDB Invest, the bank's private sector firm, created the index in partnership with S-Network Global Indexes. It highlights the top 100 most sustainable, publicly traded firms operating in Latin America and the Caribbean. The IDB not only includes environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria, but also a metric regarding development. In particular, the IDB and IDB Invest created indicators to assess corporate actions towards small and vulnerable companies, inclusive supply chains, gender equality[10] and diversity, and institutional capacity and the rule of law. These benchmarks are designed to aligns business practices with the mandate of the bank in confronting the principal challenges facing the region, namely social exclusion and inequality, low productivity and innovation, and the limited regional economic integration.[5][11] It is noteworthy that the majority of the firms listed on the IndexAmericas are not based in Latin America or the Caribbean. Just 20 companies from the region are on the current 2019 list, including 12 from Brazil, two from Chile, and three each from Colombia and Mexico. Six firms have been in the top 100 each year of the index, including Brazil's Engie Brasil Energia, Chile Colbun, and Mexico's Amrica Movil. While the IndexAmericas is an important tool for understanding good corporate citizens operating in the region, the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) is another institution to locate a growing number of firms committed to sustainable practices. MILA is a 2009 agreement between the exchanges and depositories of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru permitting investors to buy securities of more than 700 companies through local brokers. The arrangement allows issuers of securities access to investors from all four countries, which make up nearly 40 percent of the region's GDP. While this iteration of the Pacific Alliance may be moribund currently, it's partnership with S&amp;#38;P Dow Jones Indices is remarkable.[6][12] The Dow Jones Sustainability MILA Pacific Alliance Index launched in October 2017 tracking the performance of companies with the highest Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) scores in Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru and offering investors an objective benchmark for managing a sustainability investment portfolio for the region. Initially, only 42 firms met the threshold, but that number has grown to 56 with a total market capitalization of $226 billion dollars.[7][13] And the desire to join the list only grows in these countries. Peru currently has five companies on the index, but now up to 34 firms may qualify for it. Firms increasingly see inclusion on this index as talent recruiting tool and young professionals desire to work for firms that align with their values.[8][14] Yet, it is the clamor from Latin American institutional and private investors that is most revealing. According to a 2019 study by Natixis, Latin America possesses the greatest global demand for ESG investments. Investors view these sorts of investments as not only a way to match values, but also to benefit from enhanced investment performance. The report shows that 62 percent of institutional investors[15] agree that there is elevated risk adjusted returns, 51 percent believe ESG helps mitigate risk, and 62 percent think integrating ESG will become standard practice for all managers within five years. [9][16] And these investors are on to something. A 2019 academic study of Colombian and Chilean firms finds a positive relationship between the publication of sustainability reports and the increase in company value.[10][17] The future of ESG investing in Latin America is now at hand.

Again, we read of layoffs taking place in all corners of the world - but this time it will be different. The majority of the positions that are being cut will not come back.</p><p>A potent combination of flattening yield curves and negative interest rates, trade wars, the election year in the US, Brexit, and fear of economic slowdown, will propel integration and automation projects across the mid- and back-office to reduce costs and increase accuracy permanently. Companies of all sizes have come to the realisation that a good CX needs end-to-end digitalisation otherwise it's just \"lipstick on a pig.\"</p><p>\u00b7 Be afraid, be very afraid:</p><p>Banks will accelerate moving to the cloud and taking on value-add partnerships in response to the Asian titans Alibaba and Tencent. The world's largest retailer Alibaba owns Ant Financial and Alipay with one billion clients, and Tencent, the world's largest gaming companies, owns WeChat.  They are leading the world in financial services and payments products and have discovered the secret sauce for creating value out of data: Cloud for scalability and AI for perishable insights.</p><p>Separately, neither big tech nor banks have this capability. But together, they do - and the West is taking note. Witness the recent announcement of the Citi and Google partnership. And Facebook's Faceplant with virtual currency Libra, saw big tech get a painful lesson in jumping through banking regulatory hoops.</p><p>\u00b7 Your bank account will have a brain:</p><p>With the firehose speed of 5g data transmission, and the ever-increasing sophistication and effectiveness of AI, banks will cease to interact with their retail or commercial clients in a reactive fashion. By analysing cash flows, behaviours and trends, banks will step forward as partners in financial management. They will proactively assess if, for example, your utility bill that will be automatically paid is appropriate given your historical consumption and the weather patterns, and either pay it or flag it accordingly. For commercial clients, banks will proactively offer up credit lines given an analysis of their working capital history versus current requirements. </p><p>Banks will also have to sacrifice overdraft fees (forfeiting around $2bn annual revenue globally) because it will promote stickiness, and because technology will never allow overdrafts to happen.</p><p>This article is supplied by Only Strategic Financial Newslink (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.onlystrategic.com\">www.onlystrategic.com</url>).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNKLNK-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNKLNK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS3-2H81-JDP7-F009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344849</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 OnlyStrategic Bankingnewslink<logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61314\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Banking Newslink</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61201\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 17, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001R99</classCode><className>SOFTWARE AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You simply insert a pinprick of blood onto a disposable plastic collector, connect the plastic collector\u00a0to a microfluidic chip\u00a0used to analyze the sample and insert the chip with the blood\u00a0sample\u00a0into\u00a0the dongle. Once you've logged into an app, your smartphone can start to determine the presence of HIV or syphilis in your blood and display the results on your smartphone's screen 15 minutes later.</p><p>More than its ease of use, the cost factor of the dongle is what makes it possible to speculate that this type of smartphone diagnostics could one day lead to a new direct-to-consumer model for health care. The equipment needed to perform a laboratory-quality HIV test\u00a0can cost upwards of $18,450 apiece. Contrast that to the cost of a cheap plastic dongle, which costs an estimated $34 to make.\u00a0That makes it possible to imagine a future where tests are faster, simpler and cheaper than anything available today.</p><p>What makes the lab-on-a-smartphone so innovative is that, even though you're significantly reducing cost, you're not sacrificing power. The results delivered by the new device suggest that\u00a0a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory. Moreover, in a small field study in Rwanda, the team of researchers found that patient preference for the dongle was 97 percent compared to laboratory-based tests.</p><p>According to Samuel K.\u00a0Sia, the lead biomedical researcher on the project, there are broad implications for the way we think about health care: \"Coupling microfluidics with recent advances in consumer electronics can make certain lab-based diagnostics accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones. This kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world.\"</p><p>And there's plenty more innovation where this came from. This month, 23andMe received FDA approval for the first time ever to market a direct-to-consumer genetic test. It's an important first step\u00a0in terms of delivering direct-to-consumer genetic testing, as 23andMe notes: \"While this authorization is for a single carrier status test only, we are committed to returning health information to our US customers who don't already have this information once more tests have been through this process and we have a more comprehensive product offering.\" At some point in the future, you could theoretically\u00a0receive health reports about your children\u00a0by running a series of DNA tests at home.</p><p>This \"lab-on-a-chip\" innovation fits into a broader trend that has been building momentum for more than five years. Harvard chemist George Whitesides, in a popular TED Talk\u00a0in 2009, outlined his vision of \"diagnostics for all,\" in which the cost of all diagnostics could be brought down to zero by creating \"a lab the size of a postage stamp.\" Instead of taking something that's very expensive and trying to bring it down to zero (the $18,000 machine) - you can start with something very simple (a cheap plastic dongle) and attempt to build in additional complexity and diagnostic ability.</p><p>Interesting things happen when you start thinking in terms of bringing low-cost innovations from the developing world to developed world. Cost constraints become a positive, not a negative. Sia's work suggests that similar tests screening for other diseases might be right around the corner. As Sia points out, \"If you can start to bring core health services to the smartphone beyond just measuring\u00a0the\u00a0heart\u00a0rate - like blood tests - then you're going to start seeing a pretty fundamental shift in the health-care system.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not certain that all this innovation is going to be coming to market anytime soon. In the United States, for example, there are obvious regulatory hurdles to get new health innovations to market. Just consider how much time and effort 23andMe has spent in getting its genetic tests to market. As a result, health-care dongles will probably be used in the field first for remote and mobile clinics in the developing world, before moving to the developed world.</p><p>When it comes to diagnostics, though, \"zero cost\" is an admirable goal. Smartphone diagnostics is part of a mind-set shift about the way we offer and receive health care. Smartphones offer power, a simple user interface and mobility, all in the palm of your hand. Now that the average smartphone today has more processing power than NASA had when it put a man on the moon, it could just be a matter of finding the right mix of dongles and letting Moore's Law take care of the rest when it comes to testing for disease.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-798d85655f9542b38818b002777ba739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FCV-V0B1-DXKP-J3GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><timeReceived>12:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 26, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N541710QQ</classCode><className>MEDICAL RESEARCH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CR2G</classCode><className>BIOMEDICINE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009MYP</classCode><className>MICROTECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001557</classCode><className>SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX002078</classCode><className>AIDS &amp;

Some of them will have to be divided up, and all must be properly regulated.    Those are not my words, but those of David Cicilline , chairman of the House\u2019s antitrust sub-committee. Throughout the session, in which Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon received approximately twice as many questions as Apple , there were numerous moments when the CEOs of big tech were clearly cornered, with questions they could not answer and which showed that their companies had made decisions or done things that violated anti-monopoly legislation.    After this session, Congress now understands the power these companies wield , and has an enormous documentary archive with countless examples of it. Some of these were shown during the session , but there are many, many more.     Congress now knows that these companies have enjoyed a free hand for the last two decades , which is why we are where we are. What are needed now are protective measures: their monopolies have been good for the US economy, and that for that reason\u200a\u2014\u200ato benefit US business\u200a\u2014\u200athe law has been lax in applying antitrust legislation.    Over the last decade, we have seen how an ecosystem that was once enormously dynamic is now dominated by a few players that control\u200a\u2014\u200aor stifle\u200a\u2014\u200ainnovation: anything that threatened their monopoly was acquired, neutralized or copied. During this time consumers, suppliers or competitors have been harmed by unfair market conditions, through the disappearance of protections that should have been there.    From outside the United States, and in particular from Europe, which has tried to exercise anti-monopoly protections that have sometimes been interpreted as trying to keep foreign competition out, Wednesday\u2019s congressional appearance is confirmation that these markets need protecting. By any standard, the session can be considered historic.    What happens next? It\u2019s hard to say, because one thing is recognizing that the market is dysfunctional, and another is coming up with measures to effectively correct it . In the short term, we will undoubtedly see greater oversight of these companies\u2019 acquisitions, which is how they have managed to cement their dominance. But that won\u2019t be a popular measure: the result of an ecosystem in which everything that stood out was quickly acquired by a major technology company leads, as we well know, to the emergence of many entrepreneurs focused on creating companies that are not necessarily viable (think WhatsApp, for instance), but destined to be rapidly acquired and to make a killing. If these acquisitions, which occur much more frequently than many people think , are regulated, we will see a lot of change, particularly in strategic areas such as AI.    Secondly, and in the longer term, we will see much more complex operations: Facebook tried to make it look like it shouldn\u2019t even have been in Congress because it was the smallest of the four . We know it didn\u2019t buy Instagram or WhatsApp because it was interested in their technology, but to neutralize them as a potential threat , and that there is enough evidence to force it to overturn those operations, splitting up the company . If anyone thought that the congressional session wasn\u2019t going to bring about any real change in terms of legislation , they were likely wrong.    But the important thing here will be the long-term effects. Those of us who have been analyzing the technology landscape for decades remember with genuine nostalgia that time when new products, services, applications and innovations were constantly appearing, led by new entrants, by entrepreneurs of all kinds who simply had an idea, launched it, and succeeded.    Those days are over, and the vast majority of news comes from four, five or six companies. That is something that definitely needs to be corrected. And now, Congress knows it. We need to go back to the innovative and competitive dynamism of those days, before the absence of real anti-monopoly legislation created the scenario we know today . The only obstacle are the winners of an age of excess: multi-billionaires who took advantage of the absence of protection to abuse the market, put their names on the Forbes list, and create some of the richest, most powerful and influential companies in history.    The congressional committee will now be responsible for putting together a set of recommendations and issue them in a final report at the end of August. The innovation of the future will depend on those recommendations and what is done with them. But before we get our hopes up, let\u2019s not forget that there have been too many occasions when either nothing has been done, or when sweeping new regulations have been introduced badly. We are truly at a crossroads.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42738714693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GV-W4X1-JCSC-J4NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

That leaves swathes of the economy dangerously unprotected</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EVERY MORNING, from a room in Birmingham, some of the world's largest firms are briefed by phone on the weather in store. As continents, arrows and weather fronts flicker across their screens, meteorologists at The Weather Company (TWC) help British grocers decide whether to stock soups or salads, and Chinese energy firms when to operate wind turbines. Yet such sessions are getting rarer. Computed by 172 models crunching 400 terabytes of data\u201433 times the amount Twitter stores every 24 hours\u2014most of TWC'S 25bn daily forecasts now feed directly into customers' computer systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big data has turned weather into a big business. TWC, which was bought by IBM in 2016, serves governments, media channels and 40% of the world's airlines. But many property insurers, whose fortunes rely on forecasting climate-induced losses, are still learning how to use the information, says Leon Brown of TWC. Their cluelessness is symptomatic of a problem for all insurance lines, including casualty, life and health. Reinsurance firms (which insure the insurers) and Asian insurance champions are almost the only innovators in an industry that is moving at a glacial pace. </p><p>Meanwhile the risks insurers are meant to cover are becoming more severe and unpredictable. Since the 1980s average annual losses from natural disasters have more than sextupled in real terms (see chart on next page). Other risks are variations on old themes, such as pandemics or the fallout from increasing protectionism. And new ones have emerged. Ageing populations push up health-care costs. Cyber-attacks can shut power plants, paralyse firms and siphon fortunes from banks' coffers.</p><p>Insurable assets are becoming harder to value and protect, too. In 2018 \"tangibles\", such as buildings and equipment, accounted for just 16% of the value of the S&amp;P 500. \"Intangibles\", such as intellectual property and reputation, accounted for the other 84%. Meanwhile insurers' products and processes are losing touch with 21st-century life, from the way populations work to the way they drive. A generation born digital expects speed and style, which do not come naturally to the centuries-old trade.</p><p>Insurers say they have read the memo. AXA, the world's second-largest by premiums written, has earmarked millions for tech upgrades and designing services that complement its policies, says Guillaume Borie, its innovation chief. But the sector comes second to last in an innovation ranking by BCG, a consultancy. No insurer ranks among the world's top 1,000 public companies by amount invested in research and development. Insurers allocate an average of 3.6% of their revenue to computing technology\u2014about half the share that is typical for banks. In a study of 500 innovation topics across 250 firms Ninety, a consultancy, finds that many insurers are working on the same narrow set of ideas. Some of the noisiest, such as blockchain, are the least productive. </p><p>Digital entrepreneurs have spied an opening. The first quarter of 2019 saw a record 85 \"insurtech\" deals totalling $1.42bn, according to Willis Towers Watson, a broker. Some focus on the consumer, aiming to simplify quotations, make policies clearer and develop snazzy apps. Some seek to make internal processes cheaper, faster and fairer, from pricing risks to paying compensation. The most ambitious craft policies that insure against new threats, match modern lifestyles or do more than just make payouts. </p><p>Slice, a startup in New York, offers policies to flat- or ride-sharers that cover single items for a few days. Brooklyn-based Trupo provides disability insurance to \"gig\" workers, from makeup artists to Uber drivers. Bought by Many, a British startup, caters to people with niche possessions, for example model railways or exotic pets.  </p><p>Small and specialist incumbents are seeking to insure businesses against new risks, such as environmental liability or terrorism. In April a group led by Beazley, a 33-year-old British firm, launched a policy covering reputational damage. Using share-price drops as the trigger, it provides compensation and a crisis-management package. It prices risk by scraping information from social media and analysing the impact of past meltdowns. On June 25th a group of underwriters at Lloyd's of London launched a \u00a353m ($66m) facility designed to speed up product development.</p><p>But spotty innovation does not make up for a stagnating core. In theory, startups should provide valuable additions to insurers' toolbox. Yet incumbents often dismiss insurtechs as \"cute\" little things that fail to grasp complexities, says Heidi Lawson of Cooley, a law firm. Administrative costs absorb 20-50% of incumbents' premiums. A quote for home coverage is often a multiple-choice hell, with cascading options depending on such matters as whether you own a shed or keep bees. Businesses can wait months for a policy's final wording. \"It's just so depressing,\" says an industry veteran.</p><p>The growing abundance of data means customers increasingly think they can do without insurance altogether. The portion of the economy that is covered is shrinking. In developed countries total non-life insurance premiums have grown by 1.2% a year on average since 2008; life has seen an average decline of 0.5%. Despite increased take-up by rising middle classes in emerging markets, global premiums grew in real terms by only 1.3% annually over the period, to $5.2trn. The world economy managed twice that.</p><p>The result is a \"protection gap\". On average, over the past ten years, only 30% of catastrophe losses were covered by insurance, according to Swiss Re, a reinsurer. The balance, worth some $1.3trn, was borne by individuals, firms and governments. According to Capgemini, a consultancy, less than a quarter of businesses feel their insurance coverage is adequate. That fell below 15% for personal lines, and even further for health, cyber- and political risks. </p><p>A central reason for insurers' caution is the fear that regulators will punish them for unwittingly taking on bad risks\u2014or because some new, AI-powered underwriting method is found to be rejecting or overcharging consumers from certain ethnic groups or neighbourhoods. That creates a culture of \"trying not to change anything, not to break things\", says Dan White of Ninety. Moreover, waves of consolidation mean insurers have disconnected datasets and computer systems, making it hard to innovate or to absorb successful startups.</p><p>Other weaknesses are less excusable. Mr White describes a typical sequence. Starting from the premise that innovation is good, insurers try to make it \"part of the DNA\". Facing internal resistance, those pressing for change shift to an \"arm's-length model\". Many insurers have set up innovation \"labs\", \"studios\" or \"garages\" where pricey data scientists are told to come up with cool new pilots. Located separately, they operate under different rules: they have beer fridges and pool tables, and staff wear jeans and commute on scooters. </p><p>Then staff at the parent firm get disgruntled with their rule-breaking peers\u2014who, for their part, have not been given the budget to build anything sizeable. So the parent firm's return on investment is poor. Eventually the labs are closed or mothballed. Firms then give their money to venture-capital funds, run internally or by third parties. But these are designed to bet on startups, not to perfect processes at lumbering giants. Three of Europe's top six insurers have recently frozen or shrunk their main technology-investment arms.</p><p>Insurers' apathy is energising reinsurers to innovate in their stead. As the primary insurers that do their distribution lose touch with the market, the reinsurers feel cut off. Reinsurers are also less strangled in red tape. Munich Re, the world's largest, is in front. It has hired 200 data scientists and trained over 100 experts internally, and crowdsources ideas from staff. Good ideas are fast-tracked; duds are killed quickly, says Tom Van den Brulle, its innovation chief. Last year it paid $250m for relayr, a startup in Berlin that uses sensors to extract data from industrial machinery. </p><p>Reinsurers' greatest breakthrough so far is probably \"parametric insurance\". Rather than compensating for losses reported ex-post, such policies pay out a pre-agreed sum when a clearly defined parameter, such as rainfall or seismic magnitude, reaches a pre-agreed threshold. Since debuting in the 1990s, parametric insurance has mostly been confined to the reinsurance of catastrophic events. But the spread of internet-connected objects creates the potential for it to be applied to previously uninsurable risks. Gerry Lemcke of Swiss Re, which offers parametric insurance against pandemics, flight delays and hurricane damage to coral reefs, sees it as working rather like derivatives in finance, which have a strike price. Customers receive their payouts straight away; insurers save the time and cost of adjusting claims.</p><p>Reinsurers could soon shake up the market further. In recent years third-party capital providers such as pension and sovereign-wealth funds have sought to deploy vast sums in reinsurance markets. That has prompted reinsurers to set up money-management platforms, akin to betting interfaces, where investors can punt on various classes of risk. As a result reinsurers are keen to take on a broadening range of risks directly, by seeking to work with insurtechs and cutting primary insurers out altogether. \"They're calling us,\" says Ms Lawson. \"They're looking for deals.\"</p><p>Asian giants are also pulling ahead of Western peers. Pia Tischhauser of BCG reckons they are \"15 years ahead\" on innovative ways to price risk. In China Ping An, which in the 30 years since its founding has become the world's most valuable insurer, employs 23,000 researchers, spends 1% of revenue on innovation and has over 12,000 patent applications. Its average underwriting time has fallen from five days to 15 minutes; it uses AI to recruit and train its 1.5m-strong army of agents, who are 50% more efficient than the competition. Yet in November its chief executive ruled out major international acquisitions, preferring to focus on domestic expansion.</p><p>For Western incumbents, the greater risk may lie closer to home. Rumours are growing that Big Tech is gearing up to enter insurance. Amazon, Apple and Google have troves of data and idle capital; they lack underwriting skills but can easily lure talent. And they can hope for handsome profits: BCG calculates that the top quarter of insurance firms returned a median 24% to shareholders in 2018. Scaremongering, sceptics say. But an adviser to tech titans is adamant. \"We're seeing what's happening behind the scenes. They're on the path.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-KS82LHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKR-8WT1-JBKN-B016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Slow, costly, cumbersome and based on outdated technology and economic thinking, today's global currency system is a drag on the worldwide economy. An innovative plan to reshape the world of currencies and payments should be welcomed with open arms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But nobody on the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Financial Services Committee in October really wanted to hear Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about his plan to shake up the global money system with a new, private currency. Instead, he had to deal with the usual grandstanding politicians whose main objective, from their power soapboxes in the committee room, was to make the head of the US$70-billion tech giant grovel. But his opening statement is worth another look.</p><p>\"As we sit here, there are more than a billion people around the world who don't have a bank account but could through mobile phones if the right system existed,\" Zuckerberg said about Facebook's proposal to lead a band of tech companies - including Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Vodaphone Group PLC - in creating a new currency, a \"stablecoin\" called Libra.</p><p>In the hours that followed, Zuckerberg's outline of the Libra plan was drowned out by pontificating U.S. politicians who monopolized media coverage that continued to caricature Facebook as an untrustworthy lawbreaker and suppressor of basic rights. Facebook, House committee chairwoman Maxine Waters said, should be broken up rather than allowed to expand into something so vital as money.</p><p>But Zuckerberg's words contain some of the core rationales for a currency proposal that has rattled the foundations of the government-controlled global monetary system, from central bankers to finance ministers, and corporate bank executives to leading academics.</p><p>\"Being shut out of the financial system has real consequences for people's lives,\" he said of the billion-plus people without bank accounts, \"and it's often the most disadvantaged people who pay the highest price.</p><p>\"People pay far too high a cost - and have to wait far too long - to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them. The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation that we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help.</p><p>\"The idea behind Libra is that sending money should be as easy and secure as sending a text message. Libra will be a global payments system, fully backed by a reserve of cash and other highly liquid assets.\"</p><p>Like it or not, Facebook is the new leading trigger for a currency revolution that's already underway in China and India and now suddenly seems long overdue in the Western world. Libra may not make the world go around - yet - but it has certainly sent the established global money governance regimes into a panicky spin.</p><p>Within days of Facebook's Libra announcement in June, the dominant regulatory powers brokers - the Group of Seven, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), individual central bankers, European Union officials and finance ministers - began scrambling to cover their backsides. Reports flew, skeptical op-eds appeared, speeches delivered, panel discussions assembled, academic delivered condemnations, and lawmakers issued warnings.</p><p>In the end, two main broad themes emerged. The first is an acknowledgment of Zuckerberg's opening claim that the system for moving money around is \"stagnant.\" There is general acceptance, even among Libra detractors, that the existing public system of currencies, banks, agencies and financial regulators delivers a costly, inefficient service in need of radical reform.</p><p>As Bank of England Chair Mark Carney put it in a post-Libra speech in August, the \"deficiencies\" of the international monetary and financial system have become \"increasingly potent.\" It suffers from \"malign neglect\" to the point where \"even a passing acquaintance with monetary history suggests that this centre won't hold.\"</p><p>The second theme, however, looks suspiciously like a classic knee-jerk establishment determination to maintain a grip on a global currency system based on antiquated technology. The list of vested interests objecting to Libra is a global directory of the financial power structure, where it seems the first instinct is to shut down private digital competition.</p><p>To be fair, not all government agencies hold hard-line anti-Libra positions.</p><p>Bank of Canada officials seem ready to entertain the idea of private money, even though they have dismissed existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as \"deeply flawed.\" They will \"never be effective as a means of payment, store of value or unit of account,\" Timothy Lane, deputy governor the Bank of Canada, said during a digital currency discussion last month.</p><p>But Libra and stablecoins, he added, are another story. Due to their unique structure, backed by a reserve of major currencies, \"You could have money being created by quite a few different players.\"</p><p>One of the first official reactions to Libra came from G7 finance ministers and central bank governors. In July - four weeks after Facebook's announcement - the ministers ordered a report on stablecoins, the jargony generic word for the Libra currency model.</p><p>The report, \"Investigating the Impact of Global Stablecoins,\" landed in October and highlighted the costly gaps in the global system and the burden borne by consumers. \"Cross-border payments ... remain slow, expensive and opaque.\" Among the costs are banking fees, foreign exchange costs, telecommunications costs, interchange fees and a host of embedded legal costs.</p><p>The World Bank reports that the average cost of sending $200 to the Philippines from Canada via Western Union, banks or other agencies is $11.72; for a $500 remittance, the average is $16.06.</p><p>On a global basis, such remittances reached US$689 billion last year, an increase of 10 per cent as the movement of people around the world also continues to increase. At an average of rate of seven per cent, the total cost of sending this money is close to US$50 billion a year.</p><p>Facebook's main policy claim has been that a Libra private money network can eliminate much of that cost by allowing anyone with a $40 mobile device - including 1.7 billion people who do not have bank accounts - to send and receive Libras at a sharply reduced cost that approaches zero.</p><p>The official reaction to the Libra proposal suggests Facebook and its associates at other tech firms have the capacity to shake up the world of money well beyond making zero-cost money transfers available to the financially disenfranchised.</p><p>A joint report last year from the Bank of Canada, Bank of England and the Singapore monetary authority estimated that cross-border payments totalled US$22 trillion in 2016 and were set to rise to US$30 trillion by 2022.</p><p>Libra and other digital currencies would not gobble up all these transfers. Still, the G7 report in October warned that the impact of \"retail stablecoins\" such as Libra could sweep the banking industry. A Libra \"could enable a wide range of payments and serve as a gateway to other financial services. In doing so, they could replicate the role of transaction accounts, which are a stepping-stone to broader financial inclusion. Stablecoin initiatives also have the potential to increase competition by challenging the market dominance of incumbent financial institutions.\"</p><p>Another paper, by two IMF monetary officials, delivers a more dramatic outline of the competition-enhancing benefits - and the risks - of Libra-like money. In The Rise of Digital Money, Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli anticipate a major global competitive shakeup in central and commercial banking. The two most common forms of money today - cash and bank deposits - would battle Libra and other versions of e-money.</p><p>There are powerful reasons for anticipating a Libra-driven revolution, the authors say. Such money, issued by central banks or privately, offers myriad benefits, including user-centric convenience, ubiquity, near-zero costs for immediate transactions and trust. \"In some countries (China, India, Kenya) users trust telecom companies more than banks.\"</p><p>And then there are the network effects, which occur when a new technology in one area generates changes in other areas. If Libra delivers on its promise, it could spread to a wider range of activities beyond simple money transfers. The power of network effects \"should not be underestimated,\" the paper said. Network effects are described as \"the wind that could spread the blaze\" of digital money.</p><p>Move over big banks and central authorities, for the first time in a century, private money is coming to deliver a little overdue competition.</p><p>Or maybe it won't. The main G7 report - prepared by IMF, BIS and G7 officials - is mostly a catalogue of theoretical justifications for creating bureaucratic obstacles, regulations and controls that could kill the private money concept.</p><p>Libra and stablecoins \"pose legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\" said the report, which went on to highlight a laundry list of concerns that needed attention: legal certainty, sound governance, money laundering and terrorist financing, safety and integrity of the payments system, systemic risks, cybersecurity, market integrity, data privacy, consumer protection, tax compliance, monetary policy, financial stability and fair competition.</p><p>Some of these concerns are legitimate, but economic progress would grind to a halt if every new and potentially disruptive innovative concept had to run through such a regulatory wringer. Can the Libra promise of launching a new, more competitive, more efficient and less costly global currency and payments system survive a regulatory dissection of every aspect of its operations and activities? On the other hand, the West's regulatory agencies face an overarching dilemma in their review of the emerging global currency landscape. If not Facebook's Libra or some other Big Tech stablecoin, what's the alternative? Zuckerberg was lightly mocked in media reports for claiming before the U.S. House committee in October that if the U.S. did not take the stablecoin lead soon, \"China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months.\"</p><p>But the China argument has much merit. Thorsten Koeppl, a professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., argues that the West is three years behind the curve in adopting network technologies as part of the currency and payments systems.</p><p>\"You go out to China, India - you go to Kenya - they are using financial services that are all attached to big, big digital commercial platforms,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>In China, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. hosts one billion users of Alipay, while its competitor, Tenpay, claims more than 500 million users. Combined, China's thirdparty non-bank mobile payment systems reportedly handle 10 trillion transactions a year valued at US$21 trillion.</p><p>Similar systems operate in India and Kenya. The West is \"way behind\" the East, Koeppl said, and Facebook's Libra announcement was a \"pivotal moment\" for the West's financial institutions. \"The elephant in the room,\" he added, \"is central banks starting to get scared that they lose control of the monetary system.\"</p><p>The U.S. dollar's dominant role in the world trading and currency system is particularly vulnerable. Will China's Communist Party-controlled currency and payments allow the yuan or some virtual version to supplant the mighty U.S. dollar as the anchor global currency if a Western alternative to the existing financial system is not found? If not Libra, then what? In a commentary last month in The Guardian, Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff said technology is \"on the verge of disrupting America's ability to leverage faith in its currency,\" which in turn will disrupt the U.S.'s ability to pursue other objectives via sanctions and other economic means.</p><p>Libra may not be the answer to the rise of Chinese and other currencies, said Rogoff, \"But if not, Western governments need to start thinking about their response now, before it is too late.\"</p><p>There are vague proposals to introduce new government digital monopolies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). For example, the EU plans to clamp down on Libra and is looking at issuing its own digital currency. In his post-Libra speech in August, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has proposed an international Synthetic Hegemonic Currency, perhaps created by international agreement. The objective would be to supplant the U.S. dollar and somehow act as a response to Libra and a barrier to the rise of China.</p><p>But unless these new ideas are attached to and even managed by Big Tech firms such as Facebook, official government moves into digital money are unlikely to get off the runway any time soon. The implication is that central bank digitals are years in the future, leaving Facebook's 2020 plan for Libra as the Western world's only prospect for a new low-cost currency.</p><p>Opposition to opening a major role for Big Tech in the currency business is strong, but Libra has already launched a talk of a money revolution that suggests we perhaps need to update the old Money song performed by Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey in the 1972 film version of Cabaret.</p><p>Libra makes the world go around The world go around The world go around Libra makes the world go around It makes the world go 'round. A euro, a yen, a buck, or a pound A buck or a pound A buck or a pound Is all that makes Libra go around. Judging by the reaction of the global currency authorities to Facebook's plans, Libra has already rewritten the lyrics. Sooner rather than later, the world's currency authorities in the West are going to have to break out of the 1970s and start singing the 2020 version of Money.</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>The High Cost Of Transferring Money</p><p>A sampling of fees and charges to send $200 from Canada to the Philippines</p><p>Company Payment Fee Exchange Total instrument rate cost margin (%) Western Union Cash $7.00 1.68% $10.36 Debit/credit card $12.00 1.68% $15.36</p><p>Xpress Money Cash $8.00 0.36% $8.72</p><p>PNB Global Remit Cash $11.00 0.44% $11.88 M</p><p>oneyGram Bank account transfer $10.00 0.22% $10.44 Cash $12.00 0.22% $12.44</p><p>Scotiabank Bank account transfer $11.00 1.69% $14.38</p><p>RBC Bank account transfer $13.50 3.13% $19.76</p><p>SOURCE: WORLD BANK NATIONAL POST !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Slow, costly, cumbersome and based on outdated technology and economic thinking, today's global currency system is a drag on the worldwide economy. An innovative plan to reshape the world of currencies and payments should be welcomed with open arms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But nobody on the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Financial Services Committee in October really wanted to hear Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about his plan to shake up the global money system with a new, private currency. Instead, he had to deal with the usual grandstanding politicians whose main objective, from their power soapboxes in the committee room, was to make the head of the US$70-billion tech giant grovel. But his opening statement is worth another look.</p><p>\"As we sit here, there are more than a billion people around the world who don't have a bank account but could through mobile phones if the right system existed,\" Zuckerberg said about Facebook's proposal to lead a band of tech companies - including Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Vodaphone Group PLC - in creating a new currency, a \"stablecoin\" called Libra.</p><p>In the hours that followed, Zuckerberg's outline of the Libra plan was drowned out by pontificating U.S. politicians who monopolized media coverage that continued to caricature Facebook as an untrustworthy lawbreaker and suppressor of basic rights. Facebook, House committee chairwoman Maxine Waters said, should be broken up rather than allowed to expand into something so vital as money.</p><p>But Zuckerberg's words contain some of the core rationales for a currency proposal that has rattled the foundations of the government-controlled global monetary system, from central bankers to finance ministers, and corporate bank executives to leading academics.</p><p>\"Being shut out of the financial system has real consequences for people's lives,\" he said of the billion-plus people without bank accounts, \"and it's often the most disadvantaged people who pay the highest price.</p><p>\"People pay far too high a cost - and have to wait far too long - to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them. The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation that we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help.</p><p>\"The idea behind Libra is that sending money should be as easy and secure as sending a text message. Libra will be a global payments system, fully backed by a reserve of cash and other highly liquid assets.\"</p><p>Like it or not, Facebook is the new leading trigger for a currency revolution that's already underway in China and India and now suddenly seems long overdue in the Western world. Libra may not make the world go around - yet - but it has certainly sent the established global money governance regimes into a panicky spin.</p><p>Within days of Facebook's Libra announcement in June, the dominant regulatory powers brokers - the Group of Seven, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), individual central bankers, European Union officials and finance ministers - began scrambling to cover their backsides. Reports flew, skeptical op-eds appeared, speeches delivered, panel discussions assembled, academic delivered condemnations, and lawmakers issued warnings.</p><p>In the end, two main broad themes emerged. The first is an acknowledgment of Zuckerberg's opening claim that the system for moving money around is \"stagnant.\" There is general acceptance, even among Libra detractors, that the existing public system of currencies, banks, agencies and financial regulators delivers a costly, inefficient service in need of radical reform.</p><p>As Bank of England Chair Mark Carney put it in a post-Libra speech in August, the \"deficiencies\" of the international monetary and financial system have become \"increasingly potent.\" It suffers from \"malign neglect\" to the point where \"even a passing acquaintance with monetary history suggests that this centre won't hold.\"</p><p>The second theme, however, looks suspiciously like a classic knee-jerk establishment determination to maintain a grip on a global currency system based on antiquated technology. The list of vested interests objecting to Libra is a global directory of the financial power structure, where it seems the first instinct is to shut down private digital competition.</p><p>To be fair, not all government agencies hold hard-line anti-Libra positions.</p><p>Bank of Canada officials seem ready to entertain the idea of private money, even though they have dismissed existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as \"deeply flawed.\" They will \"never be effective as a means of payment, store of value or unit of account,\" Timothy Lane, deputy governor the Bank of Canada, said during a digital currency discussion last month.</p><p>But Libra and stablecoins, he added, are another story. Due to their unique structure, backed by a reserve of major currencies, \"You could have money being created by quite a few different players.\"</p><p>One of the first official reactions to Libra came from G7 finance ministers and central bank governors. In July - four weeks after Facebook's announcement - the ministers ordered a report on stablecoins, the jargony generic word for the Libra currency model.</p><p>The report, \"Investigating the Impact of Global Stablecoins,\" landed in October and highlighted the costly gaps in the global system and the burden borne by consumers. \"Cross-border payments ... remain slow, expensive and opaque.\" Among the costs are banking fees, foreign exchange costs, telecommunications costs, interchange fees and a host of embedded legal costs.</p><p>The World Bank reports that the average cost of sending $200 to the Philippines from Canada via Western Union, banks or other agencies is $11.72; for a $500 remittance, the average is $16.06.</p><p>On a global basis, such remittances reached US$689 billion last year, an increase of 10 per cent as the movement of people around the world also continues to increase. At an average of rate of seven per cent, the total cost of sending this money is close to US$50 billion a year.</p><p>Facebook's main policy claim has been that a Libra private money network can eliminate much of that cost by allowing anyone with a $40 mobile device - including 1.7 billion people who do not have bank accounts - to send and receive Libras at a sharply reduced cost that approaches zero.</p><p>The official reaction to the Libra proposal suggests Facebook and its associates at other tech firms have the capacity to shake up the world of money well beyond making zero-cost money transfers available to the financially disenfranchised.</p><p>A joint report last year from the Bank of Canada, Bank of England and the Singapore monetary authority estimated that cross-border payments totalled US$22 trillion in 2016 and were set to rise to US$30 trillion by 2022.</p><p>Libra and other digital currencies would not gobble up all these transfers. Still, the G7 report in October warned that the impact of \"retail stablecoins\" such as Libra could sweep the banking industry. A Libra \"could enable a wide range of payments and serve as a gateway to other financial services. In doing so, they could replicate the role of transaction accounts, which are a stepping-stone to broader financial inclusion. Stablecoin initiatives also have the potential to increase competition by challenging the market dominance of incumbent financial institutions.\"</p><p>Another paper, by two IMF monetary officials, delivers a more dramatic outline of the competition-enhancing benefits - and the risks - of Libra-like money. In The Rise of Digital Money, Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli anticipate a major global competitive shakeup in central and commercial banking. The two most common forms of money today - cash and bank deposits - would battle Libra and other versions of e-money.</p><p>There are powerful reasons for anticipating a Libra-driven revolution, the authors say. Such money, issued by central banks or privately, offers myriad benefits, including user-centric convenience, ubiquity, near-zero costs for immediate transactions and trust. \"In some countries (China, India, Kenya) users trust telecom companies more than banks.\"</p><p>And then there are the network effects, which occur when a new technology in one area generates changes in other areas. If Libra delivers on its promise, it could spread to a wider range of activities beyond simple money transfers. The power of network effects \"should not be underestimated,\" the paper said. Network effects are described as \"the wind that could spread the blaze\" of digital money.</p><p>Move over big banks and central authorities, for the first time in a century, private money is coming to deliver a little overdue competition.</p><p>Or maybe it won't. The main G7 report - prepared by IMF, BIS and G7 officials - is mostly a catalogue of theoretical justifications for creating bureaucratic obstacles, regulations and controls that could kill the private money concept.</p><p>Libra and stablecoins \"pose legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\" said the report, which went on to highlight a laundry list of concerns that needed attention: legal certainty, sound governance, money laundering and terrorist financing, safety and integrity of the payments system, systemic risks, cybersecurity, market integrity, data privacy, consumer protection, tax compliance, monetary policy, financial stability and fair competition.</p><p>Some of these concerns are legitimate, but economic progress would grind to a halt if every new and potentially disruptive innovative concept had to run through such a regulatory wringer. Can the Libra promise of launching a new, more competitive, more efficient and less costly global currency and payments system survive a regulatory dissection of every aspect of its operations and activities? On the other hand, the West's regulatory agencies face an overarching dilemma in their review of the emerging global currency landscape. If not Facebook's Libra or some other Big Tech stablecoin, what's the alternative? Zuckerberg was lightly mocked in media reports for claiming before the U.S. House committee in October that if the U.S. did not take the stablecoin lead soon, \"China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months.\"</p><p>But the China argument has much merit. Thorsten Koeppl, a professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., argues that the West is three years behind the curve in adopting network technologies as part of the currency and payments systems.</p><p>\"You go out to China, India - you go to Kenya - they are using financial services that are all attached to big, big digital commercial platforms,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>In China, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. hosts one billion users of Alipay, while its competitor, Tenpay, claims more than 500 million users. Combined, China's thirdparty non-bank mobile payment systems reportedly handle 10 trillion transactions a year valued at US$21 trillion.</p><p>Similar systems operate in India and Kenya. The West is \"way behind\" the East, Koeppl said, and Facebook's Libra announcement was a \"pivotal moment\" for the West's financial institutions. \"The elephant in the room,\" he added, \"is central banks starting to get scared that they lose control of the monetary system.\"</p><p>The U.S. dollar's dominant role in the world trading and currency system is vulnerable. Will China's Communist Party-controlled currency and payments allow the yuan or some virtual version to supplant the mighty U.S. dollar as the anchor global currency if a Western alternative to the existing financial system is not found? If not Libra, then what? In a commentary last month in The Guardian, Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff said technology is \"on the verge of disrupting America's ability to leverage faith in its currency,\" which in turn will disrupt the U.S.'s ability to pursue other objectives via sanctions and other economic means.</p><p>Libra may not be the answer to the rise of Chinese and other currencies, said Rogoff, \"But if not, Western governments need to start thinking about their response now, before it is too late.\"</p><p>There are vague proposals to introduce new government digital monopolies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). For example, the EU plans to clamp down on Libra and is looking at issuing its own digital currency. In his post-Libra speech in August, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has proposed an international Synthetic Hegemonic Currency, perhaps created by international agreement. The objective would be to supplant the U.S. dollar and somehow act as a response to Libra and a barrier to the rise of China.</p><p>But unless these new ideas are attached to and even managed by Big Tech firms such as Facebook, official government moves into digital money are unlikely to get off the runway any time soon. The implication is that central bank digitals are years in the future, leaving Facebook's 2020 plan for Libra as the Western world's only prospect for a new low-cost currency.</p><p>Opposition to opening a major role for Big Tech in the currency business is strong, but Libra has already launched a talk of a money revolution that suggests we perhaps need to update the old Money song performed by Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey in the 1972 film version of Cabaret.</p><p>Libra makes the world go around The world go around The world go around Libra makes the world go around It makes the world go 'round. A euro, a yen, a buck, or a pound A buck or a pound A buck or a pound Is all that makes Libra go around. Judging by the reaction of the global currency authorities to Facebook's plans, Libra has already rewritten the lyrics. Sooner rather than later, the world's currency authorities in the West are going to have to break out of the 1970s and start singing the 2020 version of Money.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Driving the news: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set to soon replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), significantly modernizes rules[1] around intellectual property (IP), like digital music rights, movies e-books. It requires strong standards against parties that seek to circumvent protection measures that are used often to protect that type of content.It also includes a provision that provides legal protection to tech platforms for the third-party content that they host or process on their platforms, a provision that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi fought hard[2] to leave out. In the digital news publishing business, global copyright provisions are trying to tackle compensation to publishers for the distribution of their content. </p><p>In Europe, the European Parliament in March approved[3] a copyright directive that includes a provision to force tech platforms to pay publishers for their content. In October, France became the first member state to ratify the law. Shortly after, French policymakers accused[4] Google of undermining the rules and said it would sanction Google for using tactics to avoid paying publishers on Google News. Google has argued[5] that restrictive copyright rules being proposed by the EU, similar to those that passed in Spain in 2014, would hurt small publishers. There have been examples of this argument[6] being made by smaller publishers themselves. In the U.S., a prominent newspaper trade group, The News Media Alliance (NMA), is also trying to pressure Google to pay publishers. A report[7] last month from the News Media Alliance (NMA) challenged Google's finding that traffic to Spanish publishers plummeted after Google News shut down in Spain in 2014. The group's CEO, David Chavern, said in an interview with Axios that Google is using this narrative to lobby against future copyright rules in other countries that would require them to pay out publishers.Google points to a survey that suggests that traffic to Spanish publishers plummeted in the immediate aftermath of its exit from the Spanish market. But Cedro, a Spanish non-profit association that collects and distributes payments to publishers from distributors, commissioned its own studies and found that Google's departure from Spain was \"non significant for the top 20 newspapers,\" but varied for smaller publications. In an interview with Axios, Cedro CEO Jorge Corrales said news traffic has migrated instead towards two news aggregators that pay publishers. \"The intellectual property rules haven't stopped the development of these companies ... It's an example of a project done right with IP rights of content owners in mind.\" In Australia, the digital platforms arm within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last week put tech companies on notice[8] if they're unable to address power imbalances with media companies. Google says in a statement to Axios that it's engaged closely with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Meanwhile, Google has been fighting many copyright rules around the world that it considers to be too broad. In the music industry, Google-owned YouTube last year set up one of its most aggressive[9] consumer-facing lobbying efforts ever to fight Europe's new copyright directive. The directive passed alongside the rule that forces Google to pay publishers in Europe. Currently in the U.S., copyrightlaws favor distributors of music over owners of music rights. They place the burden on rights holders to track down infringing material file by file and send take-down notices. Content creators say this precedent has led to a game of whack-a-mole, becausenew files just pop up immediately. What's next: The Copyright Office is reviewing the issue and is soon expected to issue a report on some of the problems.Groups that represent content creators would like to see some incentive for the tech companies to work with rights holders to come up with a voluntary solution to better police for copyrighted material. The other side: Some legal scholars[10] and activists[11] feel instead that the U.S. copyright regime is too protective of corporate ownership at the expense of fair use and public access to works, pointing to Congress' repeated extension of the copyright term[12].The bottom line: The power pendulum is slowly swinging back to owners of intellectual property, but many content owners still have to fight to make money from the distribution of their work online.

But what are the emerging trends for 2020? Will mobile payments finally have their day? What role will biometrics and the Internet of Things play? Are we headed for a cashless society? Global head of ING's Payments Centre Eric Tak (pictured) talks us through what he expects to be the seven biggest trends for 2020 - and one that probably won't!</p><p><br/><br/>1. Contactless and mobile<br/><br/>It's hardly a new trend, but 2020 marks the start of an era where contactless payments should be possible nearly everywhere in Europe. For ING, contactless card payments in the Netherlands currently represent more than half of our payments and are set to jump in 2020. We also expect a boom in mobile payments, using third-party services like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as our own Android solution. From 2018 to 2019, the number of ING mobile card payment customers nearly quadrupled. Customers appreciate not having to enter their pin code on the terminal and are getting used to leaving their bank card at home.<br/><br/>We expect mobile and contactless ATM transactions to be the next wave. It's started already in some countries, like Poland, and is likely to become bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>2. Instant payments, everywhere<br/><br/>We shouldn't only talk about the point of sale. Another big trend that's set to continue is instant payments. Payments that are executed in real time, 24/7, 365 days per year. Or this year, 366 days! We saw this launched in the Netherlands last year and will be extended to the rest of Europe from 2020. So, coming soon, it means that if I want to pay someone in Spain, it's there within five seconds.<br/><br/>Starting this year, we'll launch SWIFT gpi in almost all ING countries, after a successful pilot in 2019. SWIFT gpi dramatically reduces the time needed to transfer money to an international bank. We're going from something that took three to five days to executing 80 percent of transfers on the same day. We'll also enable people to track and trace their payment, which has historically been a problem. On top of this, the fee structure will be clearer and more predictable.<br/><br/>3. Peer-to-peer payments expanded<br/><br/>A specific trend for 2020 is peer-to-peer payments, or credit transfers where the recipient receives their money instantaneously. These are great for the many people that live from pay cheque to pay cheque. The popularity of these payments depends on the country you are in. In the south of Europe, for instance, people tend not to ask for money, so payment request apps are not as popular as say Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands. In those countries 'push' solutions are more popular.<br/><br/>We're also seeing this being extended to include business to consumer (B2C). For instance, ING in the Netherlands is working with major retailers to send their customers a payment request on delivery of goods. Merchants want to embed payments into their own customer journeys rather than be a separate activity. We want to bring that Uber-like experience, for example, to retail shopping.<br/><br/>We're also sponsoring Invisible Tickets, another great initiative where travellers are charged for their train journey without buying a ticket. They only need their mobile phone. 4. The Internet of Things<br/><br/>It's been said for many years that this will be the year of the Internet of Things (IoT), or devices that can process payments through the internet. But it's yet to happen! Of course, wearables like activity or fitness trackers and smart watches can add a payment feature, which will eliminate the need to carry a phone. With the launch of Garmin Pay, this feature is already available in ING's Polish market and we're experimenting with that, but opinions vary as to whether this is going to be massive.<br/><br/>ING's own IoT solution, FINN - Banking of Things has had plenty of interest and is a first in the IoT space. It will be interesting to see what traction this gets in the first half of this year. 5. Biometrics<br/><br/>Biometrics are already in use with Apple Pay, where you use a fingerprint or face recognition for authentication. You hardly notice the biometrics and it makes the payment more seamless. The next step is being identified by facial or posture recognition when you walk into a shop and paying invisibly. However, with this comes doubts about the exact identity of the person and other security questions. We know that fingerprints can be copied and recreated. For such a system to work very quickly it can't be too detailed, so this idea is in continuous development. 6. Cash won't be king!<br/><br/>There will be less cash, but we won't be cashless! Regulators are concerned about cash disappearing altogether. For example, how do you pay for something if all systems are down? Also, there are people who don't want companies to know how they spend their money. Even in countries where they are much further advanced in cash displacement like Sweden, they are now thinking: how much is enough? 7. New kids on the block<br/><br/>There are always new entrants in the market. Do we expect any of them to be massive? Perhaps the ones that really address customer pain points where existing players leave the door open. It's happening. For example, TransferWise and Revolut.<br/><br/>And of course, the big tech companies are all looking into payments. Facebook for Facebook Messenger payments, WhatsApp payments, they will all come. Amazon is already in payments and will keep expanding. Booking.com is also investing in its own payment solutions to reduce costs and get more data from its customers. And one that probably won't: Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, replacing existing retail payment systems<br/><br/>In theory, bitcoin has value because international payments were historically slow, expensive and not very transparent. Bitcoin transfer costs are virtually nothing and it happens in real-time. That is counteracted by bitcoin mining being so inefficient, with the whole system collapsing under its own weight.

But what are the emerging trends for 2020? Will mobile payments finally have their day? What role will biometrics and the Internet of Things play? Are we headed for a cashless society? Global head of ING's Payments Centre Eric Tak (pictured) talks us through what he expects to be the seven biggest trends for 2020 - and one that probably won't!</p><p><br/><br/>1. Contactless and mobile<br/><br/>It's hardly a new trend, but 2020 marks the start of an era where contactless payments should be possible nearly everywhere in Europe. For ING, contactless card payments in the Netherlands currently represent more than half of our payments and are set to jump in 2020. We also expect a boom in mobile payments, using third-party services like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as our own Android solution. From 2018 to 2019, the number of ING mobile card payment customers nearly quadrupled. Customers appreciate not having to enter their pin code on the terminal and are getting used to leaving their bank card at home.<br/><br/>We expect mobile and contactless ATM transactions to be the next wave. It's started already in some countries, like Poland, and is likely to become bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>2. Instant payments, everywhere<br/><br/>We shouldn't only talk about the point of sale. Another big trend that's set to continue is instant payments. Payments that are executed in real time, 24/7, 365 days per year. Or this year, 366 days! We saw this launched in the Netherlands last year and will be extended to the rest of Europe from 2020. So, coming soon, it means that if I want to pay someone in Spain, it's there within five seconds.<br/><br/>Starting this year, we'll launch SWIFT gpi in almost all ING countries, after a successful pilot in 2019. SWIFT gpi dramatically reduces the time needed to transfer money to an international bank. We're going from something that took three to five days to executing 80 percent of transfers on the same day. We'll also enable people to track and trace their payment, which has historically been a problem. On top of this, the fee structure will be clearer and more predictable.<br/><br/>3. Peer-to-peer payments expanded<br/><br/>A specific trend for 2020 is peer-to-peer payments, or credit transfers where the recipient receives their money instantaneously. These are great for the many people that live from pay cheque to pay cheque. The popularity of these payments depends on the country you are in. In the south of Europe, for instance, people tend not to ask for money, so payment request apps are not as popular as say Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands. In those countries 'push' solutions are more popular.<br/><br/>We're also seeing this being extended to include business to consumer (B2C). For instance, ING in the Netherlands is working with major retailers to send their customers a payment request on delivery of goods. Merchants want to embed payments into their own customer journeys rather than be a separate activity. We want to bring that Uber-like experience, for example, to retail shopping.<br/><br/>We're also sponsoring Invisible Tickets, another great initiative where travellers are charged for their train journey without buying a ticket. They only need their mobile phone. 4. The Internet of Things<br/><br/>It's been said for many years that this will be the year of the Internet of Things (IoT), or devices that can process payments through the internet. But it's yet to happen! Of course, wearables like activity or fitness trackers and smart watches can add a payment feature, which will eliminate the need to carry a phone. With the launch of Garmin Pay, this feature is already available in ING's Polish market and we're experimenting with that, but opinions vary as to whether this is going to be massive.<br/><br/>ING's own IoT solution, FINN - Banking of Things has had plenty of interest and is a first in the IoT space. It will be interesting to see what traction this gets in the first half of this year. 5. Biometrics<br/><br/>Biometrics are already in use with Apple Pay, where you use a fingerprint or face recognition for authentication. You hardly notice the biometrics and it makes the payment more seamless. The next step is being identified by facial or posture recognition when you walk into a shop and paying invisibly. However, with this comes doubts about the exact identity of the person and other security questions. We know that fingerprints can be copied and recreated. For such a system to work very quickly it can't be too detailed, so this idea is in continuous development. 6. Cash won't be king!<br/><br/>There will be less cash, but we won't be cashless! Regulators are concerned about cash disappearing altogether. For example, how do you pay for something if all systems are down? Also, there are people who don't want companies to know how they spend their money. Even in countries where they are much further advanced in cash displacement like Sweden, they are now thinking: how much is enough? 7. New kids on the block<br/><br/>There are always new entrants in the market. Do we expect any of them to be massive? Perhaps the ones that really address customer pain points where existing players leave the door open. It's happening. For example, TransferWise and Revolut.<br/><br/>And of course, the big tech companies are all looking into payments. Facebook for Facebook Messenger payments, WhatsApp payments, they will all come. Amazon is already in payments and will keep expanding. Booking.com is also investing in its own payment solutions to reduce costs and get more data from its customers. And one that probably won't: Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, replacing existing retail payment systems<br/><br/>In theory, bitcoin has value because international payments were historically slow, expensive and not very transparent. Bitcoin transfer costs are virtually nothing and it happens in real-time. That is counteracted by bitcoin mining being so inefficient, with the whole system collapsing under its own weight. Current cryptocurrency solutions aren't scalable enough to function as an alternative to the existing retail payments systems, which must process hundreds of transactions per second.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.com\">www.m2.com</url>))   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4J-YD31-F0K1-N3J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investrend Communications, Inc.

The game became the fastest-adopted in history following its release two weeks ago, and shares in co-owner Nintendo rose a massive 70 per cent. The share price has since been tempered with a 17 per cent fall, which is to be expected after such a rapid rise. But it remains that many people are excited about the potential of augmented reality technology, and how readily users were willing to adopt it for the right game.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, some of the big boys of the tech world - Apple, Amazon and Facebook - are releasing trading statements. The so-called \"Fang\" stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, have had a cracking 18 months. Gains in their share prices ranged from 54 per cent for Facebook to 141 per cent for Amazon since the start of last year.</p><p>They are often criticised as being overvalued or even in bubble territory. Shares in Amazon, for example, have risen 5,000 per cent since its lows of $10 after the dot-com bubble popped. Its price-earnings multiple is around 300 today, which is a huge figure compared to around 25 for the S&amp;P 500. On this basis it can be difficult for investors to know whether they're worth adding to a portfolio.</p><p>But it's too simplistic to say they're overvalued or draw comparisons with the tech bubble of the noughties, says David Coombs of Rathbones. \"We are nowhere near that. These aren't faddy companies that have popped up opportunistically,\" he says.</p><p>Google, for example, has no clear competitor while its parent company Alphabet owns a wide range of experimental ventures, which means it can have a hand in lots of emerging ideas.</p><p>\"Who knows what the next big technological innovation will be, but Amazon or Google will probably buy it,\" says Ben Yearsley of Wealth Club. Indeed, Google had a hand in Pok\u00e9mon Go's development. Creator of the app game, Niantic, was spun out of Google last year and the search giant still owns an undisclosed stake in the company.</p><p>Unless they acquire emerging technology, it can also be very hard for mega-sized companies such as these to continue to grow. \"I can give you a whole list of companies that grew so big their innovations weren't enough to move the dial. Nokia and Dell are two of them,\" says Coombs. For this reason, many investors are looking at younger tech with hopes of finding the next great social revolution. Currently creating a stir are the internet of things, specialised sensors, advanced power cells and robotics.</p><p>All have supporters: \"Machines replacing humans is a very interesting investment theme,\" says Coombs, alongside cynics: \"I'm very cautious that the innovation is less than people believe. We are at least 10 years away from robots playing a part in society,\" says Markus Stadlmann of Lloyds Banking Group.</p><p>Biotech has been particularly feted. There has been an explosion of interest in firms on the cutting edge of medicine in niches such as stem cell therapy, immuno-oncology and therapeutic proteins. Share prices in a basket of companies on the Nasdaq Biotechnology index were up over 600 per cent at its peak last summer.</p><p>James Anderson, manager of the well-regarded Scottish Mortgage trust, describes DNA sequencing firm Illumina as \"the company I think has the greatest possibility of changing the world and will make the greatest impact in 10 years' time\".</p><p>But there's also a lot of cynicism towards biotech. The industry encompasses a wide range of companies from the well-established to very early stage, which have product candidates still undergoing medical trials. Even if a firm does have regulator-approved products, many are expensive and yet to be widely adopted. Not everyone is convinced biotech will storm the world imminently. \"There are fantastic discoveries but it is probably an area where discoveries create as many risks as benefits,\" says Stadlmann.</p><p>The trick is finding the companies that can actually revolutionise society. Illumina, with its hopes of detecting cancer through blood tests, is one that will, says Anderson. \"The fact it is deeply out of favour with investors at the moment does not change that at all.\"</p><p>One area of tech which is possibly closest to revolutionising society is electric vehicles, says Peter Fitzgerald of Aviva Investors. Their popularity has boomed. There were 80,000 on UK roads last year, compared to just 3,500 in 2013. \"They are on the world's streets and there will be even more next year than there are now. It could be an area that's under-appreciated for growth and disruption of the auto industry.\"</p><p>The most well-known electric car company is Tesla Motors. Chief executive Elon Musk last week laid out his vision of developing an electric lorry, a pick-up truck, a public bus and systems to integrate them on the roads. It's the \"Musk Master Plan\" and analysts say Tesla would need to spend $3bn or more to bring it to fruition.</p><p>Given how specialised technology is and how hard it can be to sort the genuine winners from the soon-to-be losers, it's probably better for investors to go through investment funds. \"I wouldn't try to pick individual stocks outside of the mega-cap companies,\" says Coombs, adding he invests via the Allianz Technology trust and Polar Capital Technology trust.</p><p>Whatever the next big tech innovation, Google or Amazon will buy it up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-115271755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K9V-G321-JBVM-Y123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 City A.M.

In this interview, Jose discusses eGrocery, the future of the eGrocery space, if small grocers can compete online, the possibility of drone deliveries of groceries, the major areas of concern with eGrocery, and its implications for the future of retail[2].</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Grocery_1567713943.jpg\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Grocery_1567713943.jpg</url> ElasticComputeFarm[3] / PixabayHow do you define eGrocery?The Grocery market, which has traditionally functioned within brick and mortar stores[4], has been transitioning more and more into the eCommerce space over the past few years. This online grocery sphere is known as 'eGrocery.'  Get The Full Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[5]The eGrocery space is projected to be $334billion worldwide by 2022, and $100B in US can you break down those figures for us? What does that mean compared to what we are seeing now?eGrocery penetration is certainly on the rise. In the US, it is currently estimated to be between 3 - 5%* -- on par with the global average of ~3%, however definitely lagging other developed economies[6] -- The UK and South Korea for example, are currently estimated to have 10-15% online grocery penetration. The US is projected to have over 8% online grocery penetration by 2022*.What have been historic trends in the US - how much has growth been per year since you started tracking? What about globally?The eGrocery market has been expanding rapidly, and if you look at the figures, you can see that the market is continuing to grow as we approach 2020. In the US, growth rates have been around 18-20% the past three years***. Global projections are in line, with 17% annual growth projected through 2022****.How can small grocers compete in such a large space?A grocer's success in the eGrocery sphere really comes down to the capabilities and service model that they are using. Stronger value propositions are key to succeeding in this space, but only if the operating model allows for a profitable business. In fact, our first client that we ever partnered with is Florida-based grocery chain Sedano's, who chose Takeoff as their strategic partner to initiate its transition into eCommerce[7]. One way that Takeoff's eGrocery solution is unique is that we take advantage of hyperlocal operation to reach the stores' communities, and deliver on customer's expectations of convenient and fresh groceries. Capital investment in one Takeoff Microfulfillment Center is also relatively small at $3M. Therefore any grocer of any size that has a strong local presence is in a good position to invest and thrive in this market. That said, one note of caution for small grocers: eGrocery should not be white label, since shoppers still value quality from their preferred retail brands. They should make sure to invest in the right capabilities without losing their direct relationship with the customer.Are we going to see any big tech changes like drone deliveries of groceries in the next few years?We are just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to new technologies that will enable new shopper experiences and value propositions online. As the market continues to grow, more experimentation and resources will be channeled towards providing shoppers with unmatched convenience[8]. Drone deliveries are one example, alongside in-home delivery, smart ordering from your refrigerator, and others. The sky's the limit!People like to check the food they buy, for example their produce. Do you think there are any negative views of eGrocery? How will eGrocers overcome some of these issues? Perishables are one of the major areas of concern with eGrocery, for shoppers and grocers, although the challenges are easily surmountable with the right model. And while non-perishable products are growing faster online, shoppers are beginning to experiment and become more comfortable shopping their perishables online as a one stop shop solution. The key here is (1) an eGrocery model that sustains the quality of products, and (2) the retailer brand's guarantee of freshness and quality.Final thoughts on these trends and what they mean for the future of retail?It's no longer a question of projections, or whether or not you believe in eGrocery. Grocery retailers are already finding great demand as they delve into eCommerce. Having an eGrocery strategy is no longer a luxury -- it is a necessity. Today, the eGrocery trailblazers who have an eCommerce platform in place have the bigger advantage. Now is the time to invest in capabilities that will provide sustainable business models[9].*5% according to Brickmeetsclick, 3% according to Bain ...mpany[10] ** Source: Brickmeetsclick *** Source: Statista **** Source: Forrester Research The post The Future Of The eGrocery Industry With The CEO Of Takeoff[11] appeared first on ValueWalk[12].

Follow him on Twitter: @msurman. Michelle Thorne leads the Mozilla Foundation's Internet of Things research. Follow her on Twitter: @thornet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  Life online has been rough lately -- for the billions of people who use the Web every day, and also for the tech giants behind much of the world's hardware and software. </p><p>Meanwhile, amid hacks and misinformation, the Internet is entering a new frontier. Connected devices, or the Internet of Things, are introducing the Internet to even more private aspects of our lives. </p><p>First, the latest news:</p><p>A massive cybersecurity breach at Equifax exposed millions of Americans' most sensitive data, from Social Security numbers to home addresses. The aftermath yielded even more digital drama: erroneous tweets, fake websites and phishing scams. </p><p>At Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has admitted politically motivated Russian accounts used the social network during the recent US presidential election. \"I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,\" Zuckerberg had to aver. </p><p>Across the Atlantic, Google is facing a staggering $2.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Union. Officials say the search giant is depriving Internet users of choice and depriving its competitors of a fair shake. (Google disagrees and says it's actually improving user choice and competition.) </p><p>And on the African continent, the government of Togo knocked the Internet offline amid growing protests. Social media sites, online banking and mobile text messaging were blocked -- a blow to freedom of expression and other democratic ideals.</p><p>Headlines such as these are reminders that online life is deeply entwined with offline life. What happens on the Internet affects our pocketbooks and even our democracies. </p><p>All of this is happening as the Internet of Things grows exponentially. In the '90s, the Internet was tethered to our desktops. Last decade, it leapt onto our phones and into our pockets. Now, the Internet is becoming pervasive: It's entering our cities, our cars, our thermostats and even our salt shakers. </p><p>As a result, the connection between online life and all other aspects of life is deepening. Five or 10 years down the line, the implications of another Equifax hack, or another Internet shutdown, will be far greater. </p><p>What do we do? Right now, the Internet of Things is at an inflection point. It's pervasive but also still in its infancy. Rules have yet to be written, and social mores yet to be established. There are many possible futures -- some darker than others. </p><p>If we continue forward with the Internet's current design patterns -- controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley giants, with personal data as currency -- those darker futures will likely prevail. Internet-connected bedrooms, cars, pacemakers and dialysis machines would be beholden to companies, not individual users. Personal data -- captured on an even more granular level -- would remain currency, and threats such as hacking would extend to even more intimate areas of our lives. </p><p>There are already sobering examples. Consider My Friend Cayla, the Internet-enabled toy that the German government labeled an \"illegal espionage apparatus.\" Cayla is a seemingly innocuous, Barbie-like doll. But Cayla records conversations, hawks products to impressionable youngsters, and is vulnerable to hackers. </p><p>Even good news raises murky questions. Tesla recently gave its customers affected by Hurricane Irma a battery boost -- a noble gesture. But some Floridians and journalists questioned the implications: What happens if someone other than Tesla gains access to a fleet of vehicles? This is a concern about connected cars that long predates Hurricane Irma.</p><p>Alternatively, we -- Internet users and consumers -- can demand new, better design patterns. The Internet of Things can adopt an ethos akin to the early Internet: decentralized, open source and harmonized with privacy. </p><p>Here, too, there are examples. A growing number of technologists ask not only what's possible but also what's responsible. At the recent ThingsCon event in Berlin, creations from this movement were on display. </p><p>We encountered the concept of the Internet of Things trust marks -- third-party labels that signal whether a device sufficiently respects privacy. We were introduced to Simply Secure's Knowledge Base, a tool kit instructing developers and designers how to make privacy-respecting, secure products. And we saw SolarPak, a backpack created in Senegal that's equipped with a solar panel. It collects energy during the day to power a small LED lamp at night, allowing students to study. </p><p>These are ideas and devices that solve problems, as many technology products do. But they also put responsibility first; data collection and planned obsolescence aren't part of the equation. </p><p>This isn't a simple issue. Big tech platforms do have an important role to play in making the Internet of Things more responsible and ethical. But the dynamic of so few controlling so much of our lives is simply too risky. As we welcome the Internet into more intimate parts of our lives, individual consumers and users must remain in control. And loud consumer demand alone isn't enough: Regulators and industry leaders need to take steps, too. Together, we must ensure new hardware and software put responsibility ahead of flashiness and profit. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Connected devices, or the Internet of Things, are introducing the Internet to even more private aspects of our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, the latest news:</p><p>A massive cybersecurity breach at Equifax exposed millions of Americans' most sensitive data, from Social Security numbers to home addresses. The aftermath yielded even more digital drama: erroneous tweets, fake websites and phishing scams.</p><p>At Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has admitted politically motivated Russian accounts used the social network during the recent US presidential election. \"I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,\" Zuckerberg had to aver.</p><p>Across the Atlantic, Google is facing a staggering $2.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Union. Officials say the search giant is depriving Internet users of choice and depriving its competitors of a fair shake. (Google disagrees and says it's actually improving user choice and competition.)</p><p>And on the African continent, the government of Togo knocked the Internet offline amid growing protests. Social media sites, online banking and mobile text messaging were blocked -- a blow to freedom of expression and other democratic ideals.</p><p>Headlines such as these are reminders that online life is deeply entwined with offline life. What happens on the Internet affects our pocketbooks and even our democracies.</p><p>All of this is happening as the Internet of Things grows exponentially. In the '90s, the Internet was tethered to our desktops. Last decade, it leapt onto our phones and into our pockets. Now, the Internet is becoming pervasive: It's entering our cities, our cars, our thermostats and even our salt shakers.</p><p>As a result, the connection between online life and all other aspects of life is deepening. Five or 10 years down the line, the implications of another Equifax hack, or another Internet shutdown, will be far greater.</p><p>What do we do? Right now, the Internet of Things is at an inflection point. It's pervasive but also still in its infancy. Rules have yet to be written, and social mores yet to be established. There are many possible futures -- some darker than others.</p><p>If we continue forward with the Internet's current design patterns -- controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley giants, with personal data as currency -- those darker futures will likely prevail. Internet-connected bedrooms, cars, pacemakers and dialysis machines would be beholden to companies, not individual users. Personal data -- captured on an even more granular level -- would remain currency, and threats such as hacking would extend to even more intimate areas of our lives.</p><p>There are already sobering examples. Consider My Friend Cayla, the Internet-enabled toy that the German government labeled an \"illegal espionage apparatus.\" Cayla is a seemingly innocuous, Barbie-like doll. But Cayla records conversations, hawks products to impressionable youngsters, and is vulnerable to hackers.</p><p>Even good news raises murky questions. Tesla recently gave its customers affected by Hurricane Irma a battery boost -- a noble gesture. But some Floridians and journalists questioned the implications: What happens if someone other than Tesla gains access to a fleet of vehicles? This is a concern about connected cars that long predates Hurricane Irma.</p><p>Alternatively, we -- Internet users and consumers -- can demand new, better design patterns. The Internet of Things can adopt an ethos akin to the early Internet: decentralized, open source and harmonized with privacy.</p><p>Here, too, there are examples. A growing number of technologists ask not only what's possible but also what's responsible. At the recent ThingsCon event in Berlin, creations from this movement were on display.</p><p>We encountered the concept of the Internet of Things trust marks -- third-party labels that signal whether a device sufficiently respects privacy. We were introduced to Simply Secure's Knowledge Base, a tool kit instructing developers and designers how to make privacy-respecting, secure products. And we saw SolarPak, a backpack created in Senegal that's equipped with a solar panel. It collects energy during the day to power a small LED lamp at night, allowing students to study.</p><p>These are ideas and devices that solve problems, as many technology products do. But they also put responsibility first; data collection and planned obsolescence aren't part of the equation.</p><p>This isn't a simple issue. Big tech platforms do have an important role to play in making the Internet of Things more responsible and ethical. But the dynamic of so few controlling so much of our lives is simply too risky. As we welcome the Internet into more intimate parts of our lives, individual consumers and users must remain in control. And loud consumer demand alone isn't enough: Regulators and industry leaders need to take steps, too. Together, we must ensure new hardware and software put responsibility ahead of flashiness and profit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20171007internet-of-things-future-surman-thorne-opinion1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPY-87X1-JBPX-X16X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><timeReceived>11:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 7, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

These agencies already had most of the evidence Congress had on hand. Representative Jerrold Nadler presented an email showing Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram out of fear that it could challenge Facebook\u2014which federal investigators likely already had in their possession when the merger received the Obama FTC's blessing in 2012. Representative Val Demings pressed Google's Sundar Pichai about the company reversing its stance on merging data from its past acquisition DoubleClick\u2014which Bush's FTC[1] could have prevented in 2008[2]. One of Google's lobbyists on that deal is now the assistant attorney general for antitrust[3]. Representative Lucy McBath played heart-wrenching audio[4] of a small textbook seller restricted from competing with Amazon on its own platform. Folks, this is a practice that agencies and the public have had evidence of for years. </p><p>It's important that Congress publicly shamed the tech barons. That fighting spirit will be welcome whenever they have the chance to hold the feet of monopolists to the fire. Nevertheless, it's ultimately the FTC and the DOJ who will bring the necessary cases to break up Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Apple. Should Biden win in November, he'll get to appoint the officials who will make these calls. Biden and his transition team should take the hearing on Wednesday as a clear signal that he needs to get these appointments right. The easiest way to get them wrong would be to follow the path of least resistance and bring back the appointees of the Obama era. But they own a share in the failures that brought us to this point in the first place. Moreover, the career choices they've made since then should also indicate where their loyalties lie and whether it's wise to welcome them back through the regulatory revolving door. Biden's close adviser Terrell McSweeny was an FTC Commissioner from 2014 to 2018, which means she was on the watch when mergers like Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp proceeded without challenge. She also let Uber off with a pittance of a fee[5] after it lied about drivers in metro hubs earning as much as $90,000 (less than 10 percent of drivers made that much). These days, she's a partner[6] at Google's preferred law firm[7], Covington &amp;#38; Burling. Fiona Scott Morton ran the economics component of the DOJ antitrust division from 2011 to 2012, which means she was in power during the Facebook/Instagram merger. These days, she's publicly repented and has asserted that it's time to break up Facebook and Google. She's not offered the same remedy for Amazon or Apple, however, perhaps because both of those companies have been paying her undisclosed consulting fees for an unknown period of time.[8] She also went to bat for Microsoft when it acquired LinkedIn[9], Tesla[10] in its fights with car dealers, and the travel website industry[11] (itself consolidated into just two firms[12], Priceline and Expedia), all for lucrative fees. Three prominent scholars[13] recently left her Yale University program out of moral indignation at her conflicts of interest. When in power, McSweeny and Morton proved themselves unwilling to meaningfully enforce antitrust law. When out of power, they proved themselves unworthy of the public trust. And they're just the tip of the iceberg: About half[14] of the FTC's antitrust lawyers since 2014 went into Big Law, defending the very corporations they used to investigate. The burgeoning anti-monopoly movement in this country demonstrates that there's a populist appetite to challenge the power of big corporations. This week's Big Tech hearing showed that there are both strong cases to make for breaking up Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple and legislators with the stomachs to mount them. Should Biden prevail, he'll enjoy a rare opportunity to take on a group of hated bullies right out of the gate and usher in a new progressive era of trust-busting. This can only happen if he picks the right teams to lead his antitrust agencies. Keeping people like McSweeny and Morton on the outside is a bare minimum first step.

This paper addresses the challenges that have arisen from an overly technical focus on cyber security that has failed to consider the application of value sets in strategy creation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Danny Steed*</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Summary</p><p>The efforts and public expenditures that have been committed to the pursuit ofcyber securityin the past decade are no doubt vast. In numerous nations these efforts have included the creation of several iterations of national cyber security strategy to guide public efforts. Despite such investment of both public monies as well as intellectual and policy capital however, it would be difficult to claim that the state of cyber security is much improved.</p><p>Indeed, even subject experts and seasoned professionals within cyber security will be quickly overwhelmed with the available data reported by numerous outlets on the pernicious and ever-growing volume of cybercrime worldwide. In the face of conflicting real-world evidence of a problem that is barely improving, a hard question must be asked: do our national cyber security strategies carry flaws?</p><p>This author contests that this is the case, arguing that our present strategies have been overly focused on technological matters and establishing national resilience, to the detriment of values establishment that would aid the development of normative behaviour. With the scale of cyber security challenges faced by nations, and the lack of consensus internationally to temper the geopolitical future of cyberspace, a concerted drive in values assertion is a missing element of cyber security strategies that should be taken seriously.</p><p>Analysis</p><p>There are of course dozens of national cyber security strategies to use as examples. For the purposes of this article, those from the UK and the Netherlands will suffice. The UK is currently finishing its third cyber strategy iteration, due to compete in 2021. The strategy declared its aim as a vision in 2021 of a UK 'secure and resilient to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the digital world.'1\u00a0This is built on with a model of Defend, Deter and Develop. The logic of this triptych is to establish resilience in Defend, Deter bad actors by becoming a hardened target, and Develop indigenous talent through numerous schemes to plug a digital skills gap. Immediately the critical reader will note that values development and normative standards are not primary concerns represented in this strategy.</p><p>Others will contest this perspective, arguing that the strategy's chapter 8 on International Action does indeed address the need for normative development. To take this at face value would be immature however, as UK efforts have remained overwhelmingly focused on technical resilience measures \u2013most notably in the establishment of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre\u2013 and by noting the paralysis of international efforts in theUN Government Group of Experts on cyber. The UN GGE has been in a state of de facto paralysis with no consensus being reached during this period; any British efforts to shape values in this regard have clearly been both under resourced and unsuccessful in achieving aims and objectives.</p><p>The Dutch\u00a0National Cyber Security Agenda, meanwhile, is much more forthright in its declared commitment to a values driven strategy, listing its role in 'contributing to international peace and stability in the digital domain' as the second of seven priority ambitions in the Dutch agenda.2\u00a0 A core difference in comparison between the British and Dutch approaches is declared centrality in the latter's approach to interweaving values throughout its entire approach to cyber security. This comparison notwithstanding, it must be noted here that with the broader geopolitical stalemate in norms development, even the very strong Dutch approach to a values driven strategy has its limits without both broad allied adoption but also concerted actions to drive values forward.</p><p>The data</p><p>One could be forgiven for pointing to well written national level strategies and believe that those efforts have been proven sufficient. In the case of notable incidents \u2013such as the WannaCry and Not-Petya global attacks in 2017\u2013 national resilience models did indeed prove themselves highly capable. Despite this however, serious consideration must be paid to the fact that malevolent behaviour, whether criminally motivated or state-sponsored, continues to rise.</p><p>In establishing this, readers can easily be pointed to a bewildering array of statistical outlets to illustrate the continuing growth of cyber insecurity. This article will offer two, Accenture's\u00a0Annual Cost of Cyber Crime Study\u00a0and the British Government's\u00a0Cyber Breaches Survey. Comparing 2017 to 2018, Accenture reported an 11% increase in security breaches among their industry respondents. Further to this was the 12% increase in the financial cost of cybercrime across those same years; in the five years from 2013 to 2018, these are cumulative \u2013and staggering\u2013 increases of 67% and 72% respectively.3</p><p>Meanwhile, in the UK the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS), provided intriguing statistics regarding the breadth of victims across UK business. In their\u00a0Cyber Breaches Survey\u00a0a whole 43% of UK businesses \u2013regardless of industry, size or turnover\u2013 had detected an active cyber-attack within the previous 12 months. Added to that was a response of 75% of respondents who had received malicious phishing emails.4</p><p>Such numbers are compelling in revealing a picture of cyberspace as an environment rife with criminality. Fundamentally, it is clear that for all the efforts at establishing resilience at the national level, the scale of the problem posed by cybercrime has not only not been tamed but continues to grow at alarming rates in volume and cost. All of this together raises an intractable problem: national cyber resilience is anecessarybut notsufficientcondition in achieving a safe and secure cyberspace.</p><p>The geopolitical picture</p><p>While the heady days of the post-Cold War liberal optimism are certainly over, it is necessary to briefly revisit them in order to reveal how we have reached the levels of insecurity today. The rise of cyberspace was grounded fundamentally in the maturation of three key technologies \u2013the personal computer, the shared protocols for information in TCP/IP and DNS, and the World Wide Web. The explosion of the internet was seen as an inherently liberating tool, one that did not carry the need to establish any form of true political governance. One need only look to Barlow's 1996 \"declaration\" on the independence of cyberspace to reveal how some viewed the romanticised, apolitical view of the Internet's potential.5</p><p>Instead, governance was taken forward primarily as a technical practice, it was, in effect, politically agnostic for a time. Yet the fact that this was so was not down to any inherent libertarian idealism, but rather the result of historical coincidence, where technological maturation coincided with the end of the Cold War and the victory of the liberal political order. As this author has argued elsewhere, political governance was not established over cyberspace partly because without any form of political challenger, it was simply believed it did not need it.6\u00a0The passage of events however \u2013with our nations and the lives of citizens now intimately invested in these technologies\u2013 have since mandated the issue as a serious security concern, one that strategies and legislations have scrambled to catch up with. This has placed the liberal order at a distinct disadvantage given the evolution of the geopolitical landscape.</p><p>Long have the arguments persisted about\u00a0the decline of the Western liberal order. Mearshimer believed the liberal order's hegemony as 'destined to fail'7\u00a0with international realities now revealing 'cracks in the liberal edifice'that need to be tempered. Following in the same vein, Luce notes a fundamental 'retreat' of Western liberalism, arguing that the West is facing a crisis that 'is real, structural, and likely to persist.'9\u00a0Emmott also follows suit in stating that 'a battle of ideas' is underway in the West10\u00a0that parallels the positions established by Mearsheimer and Luce.</p><p>The growing, indeed burgeoning literature that has emerged dissecting the fate of the liberal order, combined with the realities of the challenges posed by areas such asfake news, serve to illustrate a key problem that has yet to be recognised in western policy circles. This problem is a fundamental crisis of confidence throughout the liberal West; a lack of faith in fundamental values that has implicitly infected the ability of Western nations to drive liberal values into the governance of cyberspace. If a liberal hegemony is under strain and challenge as Mearsheimer suggests, then other have clearly moved into the battleground in cyberspace.</p><p>Cyber sovereignty</p><p>The rise of the challenge from cyber sovereignty has created a strong need for values assertion in future cyber security strategies. With the fundamental logic of cyber sovereignty being centred on each state retaining absolute authority over its cyberspace, those who call for this position are arguing against the establishment of values and norms behaviour. Chinese premier Xi Jinping's remarks at the 2015 World Internet Conference serve as the clearest indication of the challenge to any Western view of a free and open Internet. By stating that \"We should respect the right of individual countries to independently choose their own path of cyber development\u2026'11</p><p>Cyber sovereignty represents, essentially, a clear and present challenge to any notion of a values-based, open cyberspace. It determines that state sovereignty should be absolute, abiding in non-interference not only in a state's internal activities in the digital space, but complete non-judgement in the choice of any state as to how it manages its cyberspace. Such a position is a key reason for the lack of international consensus on how to govern cyberspace in the future, and why current national level cyber strategies find themselves unable to achieve their aims. So long as the international vision for the future of cyberspace itself is contested, any strategy aiming only at resilience will find itself in a purely reactive manner.<br/>A key battleground in how sovereignty is being asserted across cyberspaces lies in the establishment of data localisation laws worldwide. With the pernicious challenges of cybercrime and attribution, states rightly recognise that in order to ensure law and order, as well as the pursuit of justice following a crime, they must be able to gather digital evidence. This very reasonable position does, however, enjoy a highly varied interpretation of applying sovereignty.</p><p>The Vietnamese 2018Cybersecurity Lawmandates not only that big tech firms \u2013such as Facebook\u2013 retain their data within Vietnam, but also maintain a manned office presence within the country as well. The British 2016Investigatory Powers Actalso interprets sovereignty based on the location of housed data, compelling all Internet Service Providers to retain records for 12 months. This is intended to enable retrospective collection and analysis under warrant if needed for investigation.</p><p>Russia, meanwhile, carries a far more expansive view of sovereignty than most with their data localisation law, Federal Law No. 242-FZ, which requires all providers and managers of data to repatriate data on Russian national anywhere in the world back to storage in Russia itself. This law in effect declares digital sovereignty not over data, but over any individual Russian, regardless of where they are in the world. Disputes over the ethics of the law led to a ban on LinkedIn from being able to operate within Russia at all in 2016 due to their unwillingness to comply with such regulation. The Russian regulator, the\u00a0Roskomnadzor, glibly stated that the company's refusal to comply confirmed 'their disinterest in working on the Russian market.'12</p><p>Building values-driven strategies</p><p>The hope by this stage has been to establish that the vision of a free and open internet, carrying liberal values in its core DNA, is under severe political challenge. What today certainly appears as utopian times for the internet in those early post-Cold War years \u2013where a free and open internet seemed the epitome of the liberating promise of technology\u2013 is indeed very different to the realities of today's cyberspace.</p><p>The onslaught of cybercrime and cyber espionage, as well as the experimental actions of states themselves with cyber warfare methods, have all served to destabilise a space shared by all. Cyber\u00a0insecurity has become the norm, and former President Barack Obama's view that cyberspace had become a sort of 'wild, wild west'13\u00a0remains not only true, but all available data indicates that the problems have only worsened since by volume, impact, and cost.</p><p>Not only have criminal, espionage, and acts of warfare destabilised cyberspace, they have also contributed to normalising insecurity in an environment that leads to a fundamental political challenge of the values that underlie it. Such rife and uncontrolled conditions raise a fundamental question, \"why should this space be trusted?\". The pervasiveness of such insecurity combined with emerging norms of state-sponsored bad behaviour and wanton criminality places a firm question mark against the ability of foundations built on liberal values to deliver a safe and secure space for users.</p><p>In turn, this has created the opportunity for political challenge to emerged, which of course has in the form of Cyber Sovereignty. This view is gaining traction less because of its inherent political appeal, but rather because it presents a political case for how to secure the internet based on national authority. Such a case has not only not been built by Western liberal nations and, as demonstrated through even just two example national strategies above, enjoys little practical unity among allies in rhetorical construct and by actions.</p><p>It is clear that the current construct behind national cyber security strategies carries a significant flaw, which is an over-dominance of technical concerns on resilience, and a lack of focus and action on the place of values. For any strategy to not only begin protecting the nation it serves, but also to actively contribute towards stabilising the geopolitical conditions of cyberspace itself, values assertion must be considered.</p><p>To achieve this, two principles should be followed in order to bridge the gap between rhetoric and actions on values. First, there in the next iterations of each Western liberal nation's cyber security strategy should be a declared acknowledgement of a contrarian political position to the liberal vision of a free and open internet. Cyber Sovereignty should be called out as a strategic competitor that is to be resisted by all who wish to preserve and nurture cyberspace in its current form. Cyber Sovereignty has, in effect, been allowed to gain political traction due to the lack of moral and political consensus among and within Western liberal nations. A first step in aligning an alliance position should begin with this explicit declaration, which will serve to focus diplomatic efforts accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, bad behaviour in cyberspace should be called out. Much akin to how human rights organisations routinely highlight abuses and transgressions for public dialogue, bad behaviour that undermines desired norms, standards, and values should be called out. Joel Rogers de Waal words this best in saying that in any kind of information war the West should seek to 'weaponise embarrassment' as much as possible. De Waal sagely establishes that 'if liberal democracy holds unique vulnerabilities to the social media age, then so does autocracy in its existential fear of embarrassment.'14</p><p>De Waal's argument can be seen as proven true in the recent Iranian reaction to the shooting down of Ukranian International Airlines Flight PS752 in January 2020, where originally Iran claimed the incident an accident before confession that it had indeed shot the airliner down. This led to uproar within Iran itself as well as significant embarrassment with, and condemnation by, the international community. Such as example serves to highlight words from an unexpected source, Sacha Baron Cohen, normally known for his comedic work, who recently gave an impassioned speech about safety and freedom on social media, making a very prescient point about the difference between democracy and autocracy: 'Democracy,\u00a0which depends on shared truths, is in retreat, and autocracy,\u00a0which depends on shared lies, is on the march.'15\u00a0Recent events in Iran serve to reveal how autocracies, the driving force behind cyber sovereignty, seek to create a shared lie, and what can happen when that lie is exposed and a shared truth is established.</p><p>The same hope must be held for driving values in cyberspace, the establishment of shared truths across an environment to prevent these technologies from becoming tools of oppression concealed behind an absolute interpretation of national sovereignty. A key measure in driving the Western vision to maintain and improve a free and open internet will lie fundamentally in calling out bad behaviour at every possible turn.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>To conclude, this article has established a flaw at the heart of national efforts to create effective national cyber security strategies. While very successful in many regards, those strategies have fallen prey to becoming overly focused on measures of technological resilience, making them inherently reactive strategies. What has also been established is that the geopolitical environment in which these strategies operate puts a reactive strategy at a severe disadvantage, particularly in cyberspace where, as voluminous data sets reveal, cyber insecurity continues to grow at alarming rates.</p><p>National cyber security strategy constructs in their present form may deliver good performing levels of national resilience, but they have been proven unsuccessful in shaping the international dynamics in ways desirable to liberal Western nations. A core omission has been the place of values; while rhetoric can be found in many documents declaring support for values, what is missing is tangible action and alignment with allies to operationalise values into a collective allied moral position on the future of cyberspace.</p><p>By calling out Cyber Sovereignty as a challenger in future strategies, and taking concerted, allied, and regular actions to call out bad behaviour, the liberal West will begin to challenge actors who wish to shape cyberspace in their image, for autocratic purposes at odds with the original vision for cyberspace. For the vision of a free and open internet to endure, all liberal nations must recognise that the articulation, inclusion, and deployment of values must lie at the heart of all future national cyber security strategies.</p><p>*About the author: Danny Steed, Author, Public Speaker and Consultant\u00a0| @TheSteed86</p><p>Source: This article was published by Elcano Royal Institute</p><p>1\u00a0HM Government, United Kingdom (2016), 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021', p. 9.</p><p>2\u00a0National Cyber Security Centre Netherlands, CSC-NL (2018), 'National Cyber Security Agenda: A cyber secure Netherlands', p. 7.</p><p>3\u00a0Accenture (2019), 'Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study',\u00a0March 6, pp. 10-11.</p><p>4\u00a0Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, DCMS, United Kingdom (2019), \"Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2018\",\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk\">https://www.gov.uk</url> /government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2018</p><p>5\u00a0John Perry Barlow (1996), 'A Declaration on the Independence of Cyberspace',\u00a0February 8.</p><p>6\u00a0Danny Steed (2019),\u00a0The Politics and Technology of Cyberspace,\u00a0Abingdon, Routledge, Ch. 1.2.</p><p>7\u00a0John J.

Sheppard</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining element in a societal transition from the Information Age to one dominated by data, information, and cyberphysical systems. As states now compete in \"the gray zone\" or through\u00a0 hybrid measures \u2014 tactics intended to remain below the threshold of armed conflict\u00a0[i]\u00a0\u2014 leveraging the massive amounts of information and data at hand is of strategic importance.\u00a0[ii]\u00a0Kinetic effect will no doubt remain crucial in armed conflict. However, securing advantage in a world with artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cloud computing requires mastery of data and information awareness \u2014 i.e., the non-kinetic and digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The AI toolbox</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI is an umbrella term that often includes various disciplines of computer science,\u00a0[iii]\u00a0learning strategies, applications, and use cases. AI has experienced a surge of excitement, research, and application in the past decade, driven by an increased availability of data and computing power, advances in machine learning (as distinguished from rules-based systems\u00a0[iv]), and electronics miniaturisation. It has gone from largely residing in the realm of academia and research to widespread application across the public and private sectors.\u00a0[v]</p><p>Despite the hype, some of the biggest impacts from the use of AI and applied machine learning in the defence context are mundane. Areas like logistics, predictive maintenance, and sustainment are ripe for computational innovation by assisting humans with repetitive tasking and enabling the processing of large volumes of data. The operational reality in the near term may simply be optimising resource allocation and management that allows actors to act efficiently within their opponent's decision loop.</p><p>While the pursuit of AI for national defence and military systems raises concerns on the role of technology in warfare, many of the concerns are not inherently new. International law of war as well as nation-specific law\u00a0[vi]\u00a0on use of force and military action are applicable whether AI is incorporated into systems or not. Principles of military necessity, distinction, and proportionality along with existing frameworks, structures, and institutions remain relevant and regulate the development and deployment of any advanced technology for armed conflict.[vii]\u00a0Military legal advisors, ethicists, and policymakers, to name a few, continue to work to identify potential gaps in existing law and guidance and have yet to reach consensus that such gaps do exist. What relevant stakeholders do agree on is the necessity for system attributes such as robustness, safety, transparency, and traceability.</p><p>Further, an AI system exists within an AI ecosystem\u00a0[viii]\u00a0that includes not only the algorithms but also the data from which the algorithms \"learn,\" computing infrastructure, governance structures, and the many humans that design, interact with, deploy, and are impacted by the technology. The development of the AI ecosystem will be critical to the success of AI systems in future conflicts. Many nations face an underdeveloped AI ecosystem and are rapidly working to invest the requisite time, attention, and financial support for growth.[ix]</p><p>For learning-based solutions, we must also address the necessity and availability of data and computing resources. Data quality and security are hurdles to AI application in the relatively data-scarce environment of national security contexts. While defence-related data does exist, it is often unstructured and not suited to machine learning solutions, let alone statistical data analysis. Foundational computational infrastructure and networking often require significant upgrades in most cases while simultaneously addressing the necessity of \"compute.\"\u00a0[x]</p><p>Effectively, the one aspect of AI that is actually an arms race is the competition for talent.\u00a0[xi]\u00a0Developing an educated and skilled workforce is of critical importance to the success of highly capable machines. This includes professional education, university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), and incorporating computer science into early education for children. While we must not only contend with the significant time required to grow capable talent, nations will continue to compete for the existing talent. For example, both Russia and China are recognising the imperative to retain or bring home technical talent and expertise\u00a0[xii]\u00a0in addition to STEM education initiatives.\u00a0[xiii]</p><p>Mitigating risk and managing expectation</p><p>Even with all puzzle pieces in place, the capabilities of AI and machine learning are still quite limited relatively and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\u00a0[xiv]\u00a0AI is always purpose-built, problem-specific, and context-dependent. It operates effectively on discrete tasks over well-bounded problems. Further, machine learning requires volumes of labeled datasets that are time-intensive to create and maintain, and the need for access challenges the defence sector's traditional approach to securing sensitive data through silos and restricted access.</p><p>A misunderstanding of the limitations of AI, in part through mismanaged expectations on the promise of intelligent machines, in fact serves as a mechanism for exacerbating risks and increasing the potential for accidents. AI introduces new vulnerabilities and failure modes into systems.\u00a0[xv]\u00a0While system failure in warfare is not unique to AI, failure in machine learning may look different, possibly in unrecognisable, new, and unexpected ways. Further, it may be difficult to verify a system is behaving as intended. Even more challenging for applied machine learning is classifying an unwanted behaviour and ensuring a system does not exhibit said behaviour again. Deploying machine learning in the context of warfare thus requires an assessment of the consequences of failures. Even in the most well-known defence applications, like drone video analysis,\u00a0[xvi]\u00a0the technical maturity and capability of AI currently presents an unacceptable risk in relying completely on machines.</p><p>The decisions men and women face in combat are uniquely human. While the applicability of AI to security challenges holds promise in areas with repetitive, well-defined tasking, we should resist the temptation to blindly tackle with AI our hardest problems of how and when humans wage war. AI will not make the difficult choices and decisions inherent in armed conflict any less difficult. Additionally, the use of AI, machine learning, and analytic support tools is not a mechanism by which humans can abdicate responsibility over decisions.</p><p>Two conclusions become clear. One, AI is likely to be one tool of many in the digital toolbox where it is applicable. Given technical maturity considerations, learning-based systems may not be the most appropriate solution for many problems. However, the defence enterprise is ripe with areas that are appropriate for the application of AI and limiting considerations should not be lost in discussions on lethal force.</p><p>Two, investing in people may be the best safeguard against missteps and misuse.

Sheppard</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining element in a societal transition from the Information Age to one dominated by data, information, and cyberphysical systems. As states now compete in \"the gray zone\" or through\u00a0 hybrid measures \u2014 tactics intended to remain below the threshold of armed conflict\u00a0[i]\u00a0\u2014 leveraging the massive amounts of information and data at hand is of strategic importance.\u00a0[ii]\u00a0Kinetic effect will no doubt remain crucial in armed conflict. However, securing advantage in a world with artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cloud computing requires mastery of data and information awareness \u2014 i.e., the non-kinetic and digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The AI toolbox</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI is an umbrella term that often includes various disciplines of computer science,\u00a0[iii]\u00a0learning strategies, applications, and use cases. AI has experienced a surge of excitement, research, and application in the past decade, driven by an increased availability of data and computing power, advances in machine learning (as distinguished from rules-based systems\u00a0[iv]), and electronics miniaturisation. It has gone from largely residing in the realm of academia and research to widespread application across the public and private sectors.\u00a0[v]</p><p>Despite the hype, some of the biggest impacts from the use of AI and applied machine learning in the defence context are mundane. Areas like logistics, predictive maintenance, and sustainment are ripe for computational innovation by assisting humans with repetitive tasking and enabling the processing of large volumes of data. The operational reality in the near term may simply be optimising resource allocation and management that allows actors to act efficiently within their opponent's decision loop.</p><p>While the pursuit of AI for national defence and military systems raises concerns on the role of technology in warfare, many of the concerns are not inherently new. International law of war as well as nation-specific law\u00a0[vi]\u00a0on use of force and military action are applicable whether AI is incorporated into systems or not. Principles of military necessity, distinction, and proportionality along with existing frameworks, structures, and institutions remain relevant and regulate the development and deployment of any advanced technology for armed conflict.[vii]\u00a0Military legal advisors, ethicists, and policymakers, to name a few, continue to work to identify potential gaps in existing law and guidance and have yet to reach consensus that such gaps do exist. What relevant stakeholders do agree on is the necessity for system attributes such as robustness, safety, transparency, and traceability.</p><p>Further, an AI system exists within an AI ecosystem\u00a0[viii]\u00a0that includes not only the algorithms but also the data from which the algorithms \"learn,\" computing infrastructure, governance structures, and the many humans that design, interact with, deploy, and are impacted by the technology. The development of the AI ecosystem will be critical to the success of AI systems in future conflicts. Many nations face an underdeveloped AI ecosystem and are rapidly working to invest the requisite time, attention, and financial support for growth.[ix]</p><p>For learning-based solutions, we must also address the necessity and availability of data and computing resources. Data quality and security are hurdles to AI application in the relatively data-scarce environment of national security contexts. While defence-related data does exist, it is often unstructured and not suited to machine learning solutions, let alone statistical data analysis. Foundational computational infrastructure and networking often require significant upgrades in most cases while simultaneously addressing the necessity of \"compute.\"\u00a0[x]</p><p>Effectively, the one aspect of AI that is actually an arms race is the competition for talent.\u00a0[xi]\u00a0Developing an educated and skilled workforce is of critical importance to the success of highly capable machines. This includes professional education, university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), and incorporating computer science into early education for children. While we must not only contend with the significant time required to grow capable talent, nations will continue to compete for the existing talent. For example, both Russia and China are recognising the imperative to retain or bring home technical talent and expertise\u00a0[xii]\u00a0in addition to STEM education initiatives.\u00a0[xiii]</p><p>Mitigating risk and managing expectation</p><p>Even with all puzzle pieces in place, the capabilities of AI and machine learning are still quite limited relatively and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\u00a0[xiv]\u00a0AI is always purpose-built, problem-specific, and context-dependent. It operates effectively on discrete tasks over well-bounded problems. Further, machine learning requires volumes of labeled datasets that are time-intensive to create and maintain, and the need for access challenges the defence sector's traditional approach to securing sensitive data through silos and restricted access.</p><p>A misunderstanding of the limitations of AI, in part through mismanaged expectations on the promise of intelligent machines, in fact serves as a mechanism for exacerbating risks and increasing the potential for accidents. AI introduces new vulnerabilities and failure modes into systems.\u00a0[xv]\u00a0While system failure in warfare is not unique to AI, failure in machine learning may look different, possibly in unrecognisable, new, and unexpected ways. Further, it may be difficult to verify a system is behaving as intended. Even more challenging for applied machine learning is classifying an unwanted behaviour and ensuring a system does not exhibit said behaviour again. Deploying machine learning in the context of warfare thus requires an assessment of the consequences of failures. Even in the most well-known defence applications, like drone video analysis,\u00a0[xvi]\u00a0the technical maturity and capability of AI currently presents an unacceptable risk in relying completely on machines.</p><p>The decisions men and women face in combat are uniquely human. While the applicability of AI to security challenges holds promise in areas with repetitive, well-defined tasking, we should resist the temptation to blindly tackle with AI our hardest problems of how and when humans wage war. AI will not make the difficult choices and decisions inherent in armed conflict any less difficult. Additionally, the use of AI, machine learning, and analytic support tools is not a mechanism by which humans can abdicate responsibility over decisions.</p><p>Two conclusions become clear. One, AI is likely to be one tool of many in the digital toolbox where it is applicable. Given technical maturity considerations, learning-based systems may not be the most appropriate solution for many problems. However, the defence enterprise is ripe with areas that are appropriate for the application of AI and limiting considerations should not be lost in discussions on lethal force.</p><p>Two, investing in people may be the best safeguard against missteps and misuse. From senior leaders to developers to end users, people must understand the capabilities as well as the limitations to guide the development and deployment of AI and machine learning capability. In our increasingly digital future, featuring increasingly digitised warfare, we cannot afford to under- or over-estimate the applicability and potential of AI.</p><p>[i]\u00a0Melissa Dalton, Kathleen H.

Sheppard</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining element in a societal transition from the Information Age to one dominated by data, information, and cyberphysical systems. As states now compete in \"the gray zone\" or through\u00a0 hybrid measures \u2014 tactics intended to remain below the threshold of armed conflict\u00a0[i]\u00a0\u2014 leveraging the massive amounts of information and data at hand is of strategic importance.\u00a0[ii]\u00a0Kinetic effect will no doubt remain crucial in armed conflict. However, securing advantage in a world with artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cloud computing requires mastery of data and information awareness \u2014 i.e., the non-kinetic and digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The AI toolbox</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI is an umbrella term that often includes various disciplines of computer science,\u00a0[iii]\u00a0learning strategies, applications, and use cases. AI has experienced a surge of excitement, research, and application in the past decade, driven by an increased availability of data and computing power, advances in machine learning (as distinguished from rules-based systems\u00a0[iv]), and electronics miniaturisation. It has gone from largely residing in the realm of academia and research to widespread application across the public and private sectors.\u00a0[v]</p><p>Despite the hype, some of the biggest impacts from the use of AI and applied machine learning in the defence context are mundane. Areas like logistics, predictive maintenance, and sustainment are ripe for computational innovation by assisting humans with repetitive tasking and enabling the processing of large volumes of data. The operational reality in the near term may simply be optimising resource allocation and management that allows actors to act efficiently within their opponent's decision loop.</p><p>While the pursuit of AI for national defence and military systems raises concerns on the role of technology in warfare, many of the concerns are not inherently new. International law of war as well as nation-specific law\u00a0[vi]\u00a0on use of force and military action are applicable whether AI is incorporated into systems or not. Principles of military necessity, distinction, and proportionality along with existing frameworks, structures, and institutions remain relevant and regulate the development and deployment of any advanced technology for armed conflict.[vii]\u00a0Military legal advisors, ethicists, and policymakers, to name a few, continue to work to identify potential gaps in existing law and guidance and have yet to reach consensus that such gaps do exist. What relevant stakeholders do agree on is the necessity for system attributes such as robustness, safety, transparency, and traceability.</p><p>Further, an AI system exists within an AI ecosystem\u00a0[viii]\u00a0that includes not only the algorithms but also the data from which the algorithms \"learn,\" computing infrastructure, governance structures, and the many humans that design, interact with, deploy, and are impacted by the technology. The development of the AI ecosystem will be critical to the success of AI systems in future conflicts. Many nations face an underdeveloped AI ecosystem and are rapidly working to invest the requisite time, attention, and financial support for growth.[ix]</p><p>For learning-based solutions, we must also address the necessity and availability of data and computing resources. Data quality and security are hurdles to AI application in the relatively data-scarce environment of national security contexts. While defence-related data does exist, it is often unstructured and not suited to machine learning solutions, let alone statistical data analysis. Foundational computational infrastructure and networking often require significant upgrades in most cases while simultaneously addressing the necessity of \"compute.\"\u00a0[x]</p><p>Effectively, the one aspect of AI that is actually an arms race is the competition for talent.\u00a0[xi]\u00a0Developing an educated and skilled workforce is of critical importance to the success of highly capable machines. This includes professional education, university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), and incorporating computer science into early education for children. While we must not only contend with the significant time required to grow capable talent, nations will continue to compete for the existing talent. For example, both Russia and China are recognising the imperative to retain or bring home technical talent and expertise\u00a0[xii]\u00a0in addition to STEM education initiatives.\u00a0[xiii]</p><p>Mitigating risk and managing expectation</p><p>Even with all puzzle pieces in place, the capabilities of AI and machine learning are still quite limited relatively and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\u00a0[xiv]\u00a0AI is always purpose-built, problem-specific, and context-dependent. It operates effectively on discrete tasks over well-bounded problems. Further, machine learning requires volumes of labeled datasets that are time-intensive to create and maintain, and the need for access challenges the defence sector's traditional approach to securing sensitive data through silos and restricted access.</p><p>A misunderstanding of the limitations of AI, in part through mismanaged expectations on the promise of intelligent machines, in fact serves as a mechanism for exacerbating risks and increasing the potential for accidents. AI introduces new vulnerabilities and failure modes into systems.\u00a0[xv]\u00a0While system failure in warfare is not unique to AI, failure in machine learning may look different, possibly in unrecognisable, new, and unexpected ways. Further, it may be difficult to verify a system is behaving as intended. Even more challenging for applied machine learning is classifying an unwanted behaviour and ensuring a system does not exhibit said behaviour again. Deploying machine learning in the context of warfare thus requires an assessment of the consequences of failures. Even in the most well-known defence applications, like drone video analysis,\u00a0[xvi]\u00a0the technical maturity and capability of AI currently presents an unacceptable risk in relying completely on machines.</p><p>The decisions men and women face in combat are uniquely human. While the applicability of AI to security challenges holds promise in areas with repetitive, well-defined tasking, we should resist the temptation to blindly tackle with AI our hardest problems of how and when humans wage war. AI will not make the difficult choices and decisions inherent in armed conflict any less difficult. Additionally, the use of AI, machine learning, and analytic support tools is not a mechanism by which humans can abdicate responsibility over decisions.</p><p>Two conclusions become clear. One, AI is likely to be one tool of many in the digital toolbox where it is applicable. Given technical maturity considerations, learning-based systems may not be the most appropriate solution for many problems. However, the defence enterprise is ripe with areas that are appropriate for the application of AI and limiting considerations should not be lost in discussions on lethal force.</p><p>Two, investing in people may be the best safeguard against missteps and misuse. From senior leaders to developers to end users, people must understand the capabilities as well as the limitations to guide the development and deployment of AI and machine learning capability. In our increasingly digital future, featuring increasingly digitised warfare, we cannot afford to under- or over-estimate the applicability and potential of AI.</p><p>[i]\u00a0Melissa Dalton, Kathleen H.
