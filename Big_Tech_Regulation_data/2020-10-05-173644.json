There's Big Pharma. There's Big Tech and Big Coal and Big Banks and Big Oil. Now comes the latest major lobbying organization to throw its weight around and demonstrate the astounding hold that corporate conservatives have on all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say hello to Big Baby.</p><p>The New York Times reported that during this year's World Health Assembly in May, the U.S. delegation tried to undermine a resolution encouraging women around the world to breastfeed. The assembly is the annual meeting of delegates from 194 nations to the United Nations affiliated World Health Organization.</p><p>For decades, health experts have agreed that mother's milk is better for infants than baby formulas. The resolution urged member countries to regulate the misleading marketing claims of formula manufacturers. The resolution was in no way controversial until the U.S. delegation, representing the interests of Big Baby, started stirring up trouble.</p><p>Ecuador, which was scheduled to introduce the resolution, was threatened with trade retaliation and the possible withdrawal of U.S. military aid. Other nations, fearing similar threats, backed down. Eventually the Russians, of all people, agreed to introduce the resolution, and it passed mostly unchanged.</p><p>\"We're not trying to be a hero here,\" a Russian delegate told the Times, \"but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.\"</p><p>This is the sort of thing that U.S. officials used to be able to say. Today they do the bidding of corporate interests. More than three fourths of the U.S. baby food market is controlled by just three companies: Nestle USA (Gerber), Abbott Inc. (Similac) and Mead Johnson (Enfamil). All three are part of Big Baby's $47 billion a year global market, which is expected to grow 50 percent in the next three years no matter what the World Health Assembly says.</p><p>With Donald Trump in the White House, Republicans in control of Congress and a corporate majority on the Supreme Court, business has done spectacularly. But trying to persuade mothers in the Third World to mix up baby formula despite having no reliable supply of clean water to mix it with is truly perverse.</p><p>It's the apotheosis for a movement that lay dormant during the years of the New Deal and the Great Society but began to emerge in the 1970s. Movement conservatives appropriated the word \"freedom\" as a substitute for untrammeled greed. It was truly brilliant how they did it.</p><p>They decided that the Gilded Age had it right, and that a nation's greatness should not be measured, as Gandhi said, by how it treats its weakest members, but by how much wealth its strongest members could amass.</p><p>The stock market boomed. Executive compensation exploded. Blue collar wages flatlined. A man named Leonard Leo built an obscure organization of conservative lawyers called the Federalist Society into a powerful force for the protection of corporate interests and wedge social issues. He is chiefly responsible for picking the conservative majority on the Supreme Court including Brett Kavanaugh, the man Trump nominated as Justice Anthony Kennedy's replacement.</p><p>\"Leonard Leo was a visionary,\" Tom Carter, who worked as a public relations man for Leo, told The Daily Beast. \"He figured out 20 years ago that conservatives had lost the culture war. Abortion, gay rights, contraception conservatives didn't have a chance if public opinion prevailed. So they needed to stack the courts.\"</p><p>Yes! Public opinion be damned. Just load up the courts with Federalist Society members and wait for the fun to begin. Steal a Supreme Court nomination. Ignore Trump's abuses as long as he supports the plutocratic agenda.</p><p>It's like taking candy from a baby. Or worse, mother's milk.</p><p>Kevin Horrigan is a retired member of the Post Dispatch editorial board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPOST-50201456835599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPOST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV7-KMS1-JBKB-T40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144565</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Denver Post</publicationName><edition>TUE REGIONAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0008GOO</classCode><className>MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002H8Y</classCode><className>NESTLE USA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>MJN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Politically, the commensurate lobbying influence of big tech, big finance and other large conglomerates has created what political scientist Francis Fukuyama calls a \"vetocracy\" - where vested concerns have amassed the clout to choke off legislative reforms that would diminish their spoils.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why the opposite is happening in the European Union is an unfamiliar tale of how governance one step removed from electoral democracy has been able to resist the lobbying of organized special interests to make policy that benefits the average person.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Active antitrust policies in the second half of the 20th century fairly leveled the playing field of American commerce. \"But starting around 2000, U.S. markets began to lose their competitive edge,\"\u00a0Germ\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez and Thomas Philippon\u00a0write, based on a new\u00a0study\u00a0of theirs.</p><p>\"Now,\u00a0Internet\u00a0access and monthly\u00a0cellphone\u00a0plans are much cheaper in Europe than in America, as are\u00a0flights. Even in Mexico, mobile data plans are better priced than in the United States. ... Meanwhile in the United States, deregulation and antitrust efforts have nearly ground to a halt. The United States has not completed a major reform to the goods and services market\u00a0since 1996, and as a result, its industries have grown\u00a0increasingly concentrated.\"</p><p>What explains this stunning shift is deliberate policy choices. As the authors relate: \"European countries created the single market, which took effect in 1993, and deregulated their domestic markets. Today, most European Union countries score better than the United States in enacting policies that make industries more competitive. Not surprisingly, antitrust enforcement remains active in Europe, with\u00a0two\u00a0recent\u00a0cases against Google resulting in over $7.7 billion in fines. European markets are also\u00a0less concentrated\u00a0than U.S. markets.\"</p><p>Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon argue that \"free markets are supposed to discipline private companies, but today, many private companies have grown so dominant that they can get away with bad service, high prices and deficient privacy safeguards. ... If America wants to lead once more in this realm, it must remember its own history and relearn the lessons it successfully taught the rest of the world.\"</p><p>          Mario Monti\u00a0- who was Italian prime minister from 2011 to 2013 as well as the E.U. competition commissioner from 1999 to 2004 and is\u00a0famous\u00a0for \"shooting down mergers in flames\" - agrees with Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon. But he adds an important dimension they don't discuss: how the much-maligned \"technocratic\" European Commission has been more able than American antitrust authorities to resist undue corporate influence over policy decisions.</p><p>While antitrust efforts in the United States are highly sensitive to election cycles and outcomes, Monti points out, the European Commission (which is indirectly elected by the European Parliament) operates at arm's length from politics and can make decisions that are independent from lobbyist pressures on parliaments at both the national and European level. As he put it in a\u00a0recent interview, \"the more far away you are, the less you feel under pressure.\"</p><p>The result is policy decisions that are more disinterested because the process is less politicized. This same technocratic distance in Brussels that has enabled a vigorous competition policy also applies to Europe's landmark privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), passed earlier this year.</p><p>Yet as\u00a0Giovanni Buttarelli, the\u00a0E.U.'s data protection supervisor charged with implementing the GDPR, laments, passing a law is only the beginning of reining in big tech abuses. \"First came the scaremongering. Then came the strong-arming. After being contested in arguably the biggest lobbying exercise in the history of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation became fully applicable at the end of May,\" he writes from Brussels. \"Since its passage, there have been great efforts at compliance, which regulators recognize. At the same time, unfortunately, consumers have felt nudged or bullied by companies into agreeing to business as usual. This would appear to violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the new law.\"</p><p>The challenge of implementing the law now, says Buttarelli, is continually challenging big tech. As he puts it, \"The E.U. is seeking to prevent people from being cajoled into 'consenting' to unfair contracts and accepting surveillance in exchange for a service.\"</p><p>Buttarelli is looking ahead to the next phase of reform. Under that reform, \"Devices and programming would be geared by default to safeguard people's privacy and freedom. Today's overcentralized Internet would be de-concentrated, as\u00a0advocated\u00a0by Tim Berners-Lee, who first invented the Internet, with a fairer allocation of the digital dividend and with the control of information handed back to individuals from big tech and the state.\"</p><p>While big tech lobbyists have so far frustrated privacy legislation at the national level in the United States, California has been able to pass curbs on abuses of personal data. Ironically, this was due not to technocratic insulation from politics but its opposite: the citizens' ballot initiative. A San Francisco real estate magnate funded the gathering of qualifying signatures for a proposition that would impose the same kind of limits on use of personal data in California as contained in the GDPR, forcing big tech to come - reluctantly - to the table.</p><p>State legislators then negotiated and passed a measure this summer along GDPR lines that would be open to amendment as technology evolves. With legislation secured, the initiative was withdrawn from the public ballot. (If law is made by the citizens' ballot initiative, it can only be amended by another vote of the public.) As state Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D), who crafted the compromise between privacy advocates and the tech companies, notes, the law in effect makes California's attorney general the nation's \"chief privacy officer,\" since most of the big tech companies affected are located in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Making a market that works for the average citizen requires government that acts in the public interest, not at the behest of the largest players in the economy who underwrite the electoral and legislative process.

However, claims of intellectual property theft and other issues led to a protracted trade spat between the country and the US, disrupting some of these supply chains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For clarity, the definition of technology here encompasses everything from artificial intelligence (AI) to the internet of things and electronic manufacturing services. The core of the tech war, however, is semiconductors. This is because semiconductors are vital to all future industries such as AI and quantum computing.</p><p>In his report \u00e2  Semiconductors at the Heart of the US-China Tech War: How a New Era of Techno-Nationalism is Shaking up Semiconductor Value Chains\u00e2 , Hinrich Foundation research fellow Alex Capri notes that the decoupling of certain US-China value chains in the semiconductor industry has become inevitable.</p><p>\u00e2  Even if the two superpowers are able to repair ongoing trade tensions and hammer out a series of trade deals, there will be no turning back from the pervasive effects of techno-nationalist policies and the salient connection between semiconductors and national security.</p><p>\u00e2  By definition, decoupling involves the divorcing or separation of previously joined, embedded, intertwined value chains. \u00c2\u00adAlthough the name implies that just two primary parties are involved, many more entities and stakeholders are involved, including primary and secondary suppliers up and down the value chain,\u00e2  says Capri.</p><p>He defines techno-nationalism as a \u00e2  new strain of mercantilist thought that links tech innovation directly to economic prosperity, social stability and to the national security policies of a nation\u00e2 .</p><p>The impact of a potential tech decoupling depends on how much technology is being decoupled, says Roger Entner, founder and lead analyst of US-based consulting firm Recon Analytics.</p><p>\u00e2  There are a number of key technological pieces that are American IP [intellectual property] that cannot be replicated in chip design [such as the] ARM and x86, and the computer OS [operating system]. The greater the decoupling, the bigger the impact on China [because] modern technology as we know it does not work without American IP,\u00e2  Entner tells The Edge.</p><p>Impact on Malaysia</p><p>Capri, who is also a senior fellow and lecturer at the National University of Singapore, says a disruption in the value chain of large technology players, be it from the US or China, would affect the global tech supply chain, including that of Malaysia.</p><p>He explains that a supply chain needs to be looked at as more of an ecosystem, or more broadly, a value chain. In an ecosystem, there are large original equipment manufacturers such as Huawei and big semiconductors like Qualcomm or Intel, as well as first and second-tier suppliers that support those large entities.</p><p>\u00e2  So, if you start with a major disruption to the big players, for example, Huawei, Intel or Micron [Technology], that is going to kick off a chain reaction. Every time you get a concentric layer out from the big players, the collateral damage gets multiplied, because the smaller the company is, the harder it is to absorb the shock.</p><p>\u00e2  However, value chains and ecosystems are a force of nature, meaning they are organic and evolving, so they are constantly looking to replenish and restructure to survive. So, in the case of Malaysian suppliers, which may be first- or second-tier suppliers, they are going to try to fit in to what the next phase of restructuring is. If that means that an extended global supply chain is now \u00c2\u00adgoing to be more fragmented and chopped up, then it\u00e2  s likely that there would be a more regionalised or localised focus, or a focus within a ring-fenced environment,\u00e2  Capri tells The Edge via phone.</p><p>He qualifies, however, that this does not mean critical parts of the technology value chain could move to Malaysia.</p><p>\u00e2  We have to divide technology into super high end, which is semiconductors, which is capital intensive and requires the full cluster of complements [to support it], and low end. Therefore, I don\u00e2  t think there would be significant semiconductor activity moving to Malaysia,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>Nevertheless, Capri sees opportunities for Malaysia in the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) space, through the \u00e2  China Plus One\u00e2  model, where companies in China look to diversify their operations and reduce operating costs by adding another location in Asia.</p><p>\u00e2  Looking at the China Plus One model in the consumer electronics [space], I think that is a net win if Malaysia plays it right and creates a receptive investment environment regulatory-wise, and has the right kind of governance frameworks in place,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>However, he points out that it is important that policymakers do not fall into the binary trap.</p><p>\u00e2  If I am a policymaker anywhere in Southeast Asia and I want to capitalise on the US-China trade issues by making my country a more attractive alternative, one of the things I am going to try and avoid is falling into this so-called binary trap.</p><p>\u00e2  In other words, I do not, as a policymaker, want to be in a situation where I am forced to choose between the US and China, as that is a really self-destructive act, as it means I am overcommitting to one entity and limiting myself in terms of opportunities,\u00e2  Capri says.</p><p>Lim Tze Cheng, head of research at EquitiesTracker Holdings Bhd, a stock investment research platform and training provider, is of the view that Malaysian tech players involved in the manufacturing of automatic test equipment (ATE) are likely to be beneficiaries of the tech war.</p><p>Malaysian tech players typically fall into three broad categories: OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test), ATE and EMS.</p><p>\u00e2  Those involved in test equipment are indirect beneficiaries of the tech war due to capacity building. The US is currently building capacity \u00e2 \" in other words, equipment and machinery \u00e2 \" out of China, while China is building its capacity within China.</p><p>\u00e2  I am also bullish on semiconductor players, but I would say that is only partially due to the tech war, as what will actually be driving the semiconductor industry is 5G-related infrastructure, which is creating a lot of demand for chips. Semiconductor players, not just in Malaysia but globally, had a tough 2019 due to the trade war, as it delayed demand due to uncertainties on tariffs. But with 5G coming, global semiconductor numbers already started to pick up from November last year.</p><p>\u00e2  Stock-wise, I am positive on KESM Industries Bhd, which provides burn-in test services for the semiconductor industry, as I believe the company could be a beneficiary once the semiconductor demand returns [in full swing], \u00e2  Lim tells The Edge.</p><p>Penang FDI\u00e2  s up 445%</p><p>In the first nine months of 2019, Penang, once dubbed the \u00e2  Silicone Valley of The East\u00e2  because of its position as a hub for electrical and electronics manufacturing companies, saw a whopping 445% year-on-year increase in foreign direct investment to RM12 billion, representing 31% of Malaysia\u00e2  s total manufacturing FDI.</p><p>\u00e2  The top FDIs were from the US, Singapore and the UK. [These] included projects from Micron Technology, Jabil Circuit, as well as Smith+Nephew.</p><p>\u00e2  Electrical and electronics, and scientific and measuring equipment [which encompasses medical devices] industries collectively contributed 86% of Penang\u00e2  s total investment in January-September 2019. US companies are the key contributors to Penang\u00e2  s FDI in the same period,\u00e2  InvestPenang CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian tells The Edge.</p><p>Loo says, however, that InvestPenang is unable to quantify how much of these investments are a direct result of the technology decoupling between the US and China. Nevertheless, Penang has received more investment enquiries from Chinese companies since the trade war started, she adds.</p><p>\u00e2  While direct investment is one of the options for investors, there is also interest from Chinese companies to form joint ventures with local companies, or outsource their jobs to local companies.</p><p>\u00e2  The US, historically, has been one of the key FDI contributors to Penang. In fact, in January to September 2019, 57% of Penang\u00e2  s total FDI came from US companies. Based on our engagement with potential investors, we gauge that interest from US companies in Penang is still encouraging,\u00e2  she says.</p><p>Loo adds that the state government will continue to focus on attracting high-\u00c2\u00adquality investments that fit the state\u00e2  s industry profile, without any preference for the companies\u00e2   country of origin.</p><p>What tech players say</p><p>Penang-based Globetronics Technology Bhd, which is involved in the manufacturing, assembly, testing and sale of integrated circuits, chip carrier quartz crystal products as well as sensors and optical products, views the tech war as an opportunity for expansion.</p><p>\u00e2  From Globetronics\u00e2   standpoint, the decoupling has rendered us many new opportunities to work with the global companies that have relocated here, both for products that we are currently doing [sensors] as well as for new products, for example in the medical space and power ICs [integrated circuits].</p><p>\u00e2  As for enquiries from China companies, these are a mixed bag in the sense that a lot of them are looking to transfer their more mature, labour-intensive lines to Penang, which is not sustainable and [not] what Globetronics is looking for, so we are picking our opportunities at this point,\u00e2  Globetronics corporate director Ng Kok Yu tells The Edge.</p><p>\u00e2  Although we do not have any tangible wins at this time, we believe the preliminary discussions that we have with potential customers would eventually lead us to a good win, getting new products for our business portfolio.</p><p>\u00e2  The recent signing of the phase one trade deal has also alleviated some of the uncertainty [and] we are hopeful [it] will lead to increased business confidence and spending that will help kick-start the next upturn in the electronics sector after a turbulent 2019,\u00e2  he adds.</p><p>The decoupling has also been advantageous to test contacting solutions provider JF Technology Bhd.</p><p>\u00e2  I would say that we are a beneficiary of the decoupling, as China which has [in the past] been well serviced by American suppliers, has [started] to look for other suppliers, and hence, we are in picture. This is specifically for products related to radio frequency and 5G, where they find our products provide a more optimal cost of testing,\u00e2  JF managing director Datuk Foong Wei Kuong tells The Edge.</p><p>Digital security solutions provider \u00c2\u00adSecuremetric Bhd, which counts Shenzhen Stock Exchange-listed Feitian Technologies Co Ltd as a substantial shareholder, says the latter has been on an aggressive drive.</p><p>\u00e2  We have started working on a few very interesting collaborations after [Feitian] became our shareholder, like FIDO [fast identity online] devices, of which Feitian is one of the world\u00e2  s leading providers, and devices related to mobile payments, such as Cloud Payment Voice Box and Smart POS.</p><p>\u00e2  They have been more aggressively expanding their business portfolio into many regions, including Southeast Asia, through us,\u00e2  Securemetric CEO Edward Law Seeh Key tells The Edge.</p><p>Downside of tech war</p><p>In some ways, the tech war could bring about a deceleration in new technologies, says Capri.</p><p>Where once there were global value chains where ideas were exchanged and companies worked together to achieve economies of scale, now those collaborative networks are being restricted, he explains.</p><p>\u00e2  So, in some cases, we are going into the dark ages of innovation, because with a complete lack of collaboration and with regionalisation and localisation, those benefits are lost, and things are becoming harder and more expensive, and progress in certain sectors will go much more slowly,\u00e2  Capri says.</p><p>Recon\u00e2  s Entner believes that a shift of supply chains to Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand would be a slow and painful process.</p><p>\u00e2  Integrated supply chains take a long time to change as having two paths makes everything slower and more expensive,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>As the effects of a prolonged tech war and the decoupling of US and China technology are being played out, it remains to be seen if the countries can thrive as two separate tech heavyweights. It is an irony that in a world that is striving to stay interconnected through technology, the two superpowers are choosing to do so through a great, big tech disconnect.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGEMA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGEMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4R-2W01-DYX1-V191-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Communications Sdn.

But they are a long way from displacing the banks, according to Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group Holdings. In fact, it could well be that the digitalisation efforts of established banks will change the industry most. \"The single-biggest game changer in our operation is the digital revolution,\" Gupta tells The Edge Singapore in a recent interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu, Tencent Holdings as well as JD.com have been building online payment capabilities and are now offering consumer credit, small and medium-sized enterprise loans and wealth management products, according to a May 23 report by Goldman Sachs. Alibaba's Money Market Fund had US$93 billion ($123.8 billion) in outstanding funds, as at Dec 31. Meanwhile, Apple Pay and its arch-rival, Google Wallet, are squaring off in the US. And, PayPal is looking for ways to deepen its role in the payment system in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Gupta says these emerging competitors to the financial services sector provide a good customer experience and are proving to be adept at drawing users. Yet, he figures banks are at a significant advantage, because of their robust risk management processes as well as their liquid and well-capitalised balance sheets. \"None of these companies have ever been through a liquidity-shock event,\" Gupta says of the e-commerce players. \"If they have a sudden outflow and run out of money, they don't have the experience, track record and models to handle that.\"</p><p>On the other hand, banks have been forced to meet ever-tougher capital standards over the years, and are almost paranoid about their liquidity management. \"Banks complain about capital requirements. But one of the upsides is you're a lot more solvent,\" Gupta says. Furthermore, banks have established clearing and settlement mechanisms. Apple Pay and Alipay use the bank network for settlement because they haven't been able to build their own clearing and settlement systems.</p><p>Indeed, despite all the hype, the likes of Apple Pay and Google Wallet are veritable minnows compared with the established banks. \"If you think about all of the revenues in the banking system, [e-commerce companies account] for less than 1%. There is still 99% of the revenue pool out there for banks that build the right digital model,\" Gupta says.</p><p>Big tech investments</p><p>While Gupta is sceptical that the e-commerce players will replace the banks anytime soon, he is no Luddite. On the contrary, he was swept up by the dotcom fever of the late 1990s, and temporarily left his career in banking to start a portal called Go4i.com with some partners. Unfortunately, it was 2001 by the time he got started, and the technology bubble was already deflating fast.</p><p>Now, even though he doesn't see e-commerce players upstaging the banks, Gupta has no doubt that technology is changing the banking industry. And, DBS is determined not to be left behind. In 2013, DBS said it would spend $200 million over three years on digital banking investments. Significantly, DBS is working with IBM's Watson, a computer with cognitive powers. Already, the bank is using Watson to help pair products with customers. It is also using Watson to identify underperforming bank branches and come up with ways to improve them. Elsewhere, DBS is partnering A*Star to research ways to simplify banking.</p><p>In 2012, DBS was the first bank in Singapore to implement interaction analytics at its customer centres to help improve service at its branches. Similarly, DBS embedded sensors in its ATMs that helped analyse cash flow and dispense velocity, allowing it to better manage its ATM network. \"We changed the whole service model,\" Gupta boasts, adding that the digitalisation of its operations is one of the reasons the group is performing so well now.</p><p>Gupta figures that DBS is actually ideally positioned to ride the digital banking wave. It's large enough to be a credible player in the banking space, yet it's small and nimble enough to adopt new technologies fast. This year, DBS plans to roll out a digital banking offering in India to attract retail customers.</p><p>Downside of digital</p><p>Among the consequences of the move towards digital banking, however, is the closure of some brick-and-mortar branches and the loss of jobs. Citing statistics from the British Bankers Association (BBA), Goldman Sachs points out that the footfall for branches in the UK declined 30% in the last three years, while the number of banking-related mobile applications doubled in 2013. The development of alternative channels and lower footfall have led banks to trim their branch networks. In 2014, 350 bank branches were closed in the UK. Based on this trend, the country's 9,500-strong branch network could fall to 7,000 by end-2018.</p><p>Now, banks all over the world are quickly going digital, too. \"The initial focus on digitisation would be for retail customers and, to some extent, SMEs,\" Goldman Sachs says. \"We believe corporate accounts require less digitisation, as they would involve relationship managers being able to provide advice and discuss a full suite of financial solutions, which may need to be tailor-made according to the needs of the corporates.\"</p><p>According to Goldman Sachs, a bank that may have got its model right is M-Shwari, a division of Kenya-based Commercial Bank of Africa, a corporate bank. To break into retail banking, M-Shwari entered into a partnership with a mobile operator, Safaricom, in November 2012. M-Shwari is in charge of products, assessing credit risk, managing the balance sheet and regulatory requirements. Marketing, communication and distribution are handled by Safaricom. As at end-2014, M-Shwari had 300,000 term deposit customers, 10 million current account customers and 1.4 million borrowers.</p><p>Gupta agrees that digital banking is a global phenomenon. \"There are several banks in the world headed in the digital direction. Three or four are doing a good job. Every bank will try and get there,\" he says. \"When I go and talk to my peers around the world today, the single biggest conversation agenda has now switched to 'how do you compete in the digital space?'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G92-7GT1-DYX1-T00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Edge Publishing PTE.

But they are a long way from displacing the banks, according to Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group Holdings. In fact, it could well be that the digitalisation efforts of established banks will change the industry most. \"The single-biggest game changer in our operation is the digital revolution,\" Gupta tells The Edge Singapore in a recent interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu, Tencent Holdings as well as JD.com have been building online payment capabilities and are now offering consumer credit, small and medium-sized enterprise loans and wealth management products, according to a May 23 report by Goldman Sachs. Alibaba's Money Market Fund had US$93 billion ($123.8 billion) in outstanding funds, as at Dec 31. Meanwhile, Apple Pay and its arch-rival, Google Wallet, are squaring off in the US. And, PayPal is looking for ways to deepen its role in the payment system in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Gupta says these emerging competitors to the financial services sector provide a good customer experience and are proving to be adept at drawing users. Yet, he figures banks are at a significant advantage, because of their robust risk management processes as well as their liquid and well-capitalised balance sheets. \"None of these companies have ever been through a liquidity-shock event,\" Gupta says of the e-commerce players. \"If they have a sudden outflow and run out of money, they don't have the experience, track record and models to handle that.\"</p><p>On the other hand, banks have been forced to meet ever-tougher capital standards over the years, and are almost paranoid about their liquidity management. \"Banks complain about capital requirements. But one of the upsides is you're a lot more solvent,\" Gupta says. Furthermore, banks have established clearing and settlement mechanisms. Apple Pay and Alipay use the bank network for settlement because they haven't been able to build their own clearing and settlement systems.</p><p>Indeed, despite all the hype, the likes of Apple Pay and Google Wallet are veritable minnows compared with the established banks. \"If you think about all of the revenues in the banking system, [e-commerce companies account] for less than 1%. There is still 99% of the revenue pool out there for banks that build the right digital model,\" Gupta says.</p><p>Big tech investments</p><p>While Gupta is sceptical that the e-commerce players will replace the banks anytime soon, he is no Luddite. On the contrary, he was swept up by the dotcom fever of the late 1990s, and temporarily left his career in banking to start a portal called Go4i.com with some partners. Unfortunately, it was 2001 by the time he got started, and the technology bubble was already deflating fast.</p><p>Now, even though he doesn't see e-commerce players upstaging the banks, Gupta has no doubt that technology is changing the banking industry. And, DBS is determined not to be left behind. In 2013, DBS said it would spend $200 million over three years on digital banking investments. Significantly, DBS is working with IBM's Watson, a computer with cognitive powers. Already, the bank is using Watson to help pair products with customers. It is also using Watson to identify underperforming bank branches and come up with ways to improve them. Elsewhere, DBS is partnering A*Star to research ways to simplify banking.</p><p>In 2012, DBS was the first bank in Singapore to implement interaction analytics at its customer centres to help improve service at its branches. Similarly, DBS embedded sensors in its ATMs that helped analyse cash flow and dispense velocity, allowing it to better manage its ATM network. \"We changed the whole service model,\" Gupta boasts, adding that the digitalisation of its operations is one of the reasons the group is performing so well now.</p><p>Gupta figures that DBS is actually ideally positioned to ride the digital banking wave. It's large enough to be a credible player in the banking space, yet it's small and nimble enough to adopt new technologies fast. This year, DBS plans to roll out a digital banking offering in India to attract retail customers.</p><p>Downside of digital</p><p>Among the consequences of the move towards digital banking, however, is the closure of some brick-and-mortar branches and the loss of jobs. Citing statistics from the British Bankers Association (BBA), Goldman Sachs points out that the footfall for branches in the UK declined 30% in the last three years, while the number of banking-related mobile applications doubled in 2013. The development of alternative channels and lower footfall have led banks to trim their branch networks. In 2014, 350 bank branches were closed in the UK. Based on this trend, the country's 9,500-strong branch network could fall to 7,000 by end-2018.</p><p>Now, banks all over the world are quickly going digital, too. \"The initial focus on digitisation would be for retail customers and, to some extent, SMEs,\" Goldman Sachs says. \"We believe corporate accounts require less digitisation, as they would involve relationship managers being able to provide advice and discuss a full suite of financial solutions, which may need to be tailor-made according to the needs of the corporates.\"</p><p>According to Goldman Sachs, a bank that may have got its model right is M-Shwari, a division of Kenya-based Commercial Bank of Africa, a corporate bank. To break into retail banking, M-Shwari entered into a partnership with a mobile operator, Safaricom, in November 2012. M-Shwari is in charge of products, assessing credit risk, managing the balance sheet and regulatory requirements. Marketing, communication and distribution are handled by Safaricom. As at end-2014, M-Shwari had 300,000 term deposit customers, 10 million current account customers and 1.4 million borrowers.</p><p>Gupta agrees that digital banking is a global phenomenon. \"There are several banks in the world headed in the digital direction. Three or four are doing a good job. Every bank will try and get there,\" he says. \"When I go and talk to my peers around the world today, the single biggest conversation agenda has now switched to 'how do you compete in the digital space?'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GB7-TPR1-JCF0-300C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Yet, the CEO of SGInnovate has increasingly become a pitchman for Singapore's quest to be Asia's Silicon Valley. \"What I say is, 'We are working on these things in Singapore,' and 'Does anyone want to work on this stuff with us? Here is my email,'\" Leonard says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SGInnovate is the successor of Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, investment arm of the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA). Managing more than $200 million, IIPL had been responsible for building and investing in IT start-ups. IIPL has since been reorganised as a pillar under SGInnovate, which is now part of the National Research Foundation (NRF). Like its predecessor, SGInnovate's role is that of an accelerator for Singapore's technological ecosystem. It works with entrepreneurs, investors, universities, companies and government agencies to build and scale start-ups.</p><p>But Leonard is also trying to refine what start-ups the country will aim to build. SGInnovate wants to focus on deep technologies, starting with artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. In doing so, he hopes to make Singapore a hub for such innovative solutions. \"We don't want to build every single type of start-up,\" he says. \"We are focusing on things that are research-based with intellectual property rights because these assets will help us build companies or technologies that are scalable [and, more importantly,] protectable.\"</p><p>Singapore is already a major funding and operating base for start-ups, venture capitalists (VCs) and the various players that make up the global tech ecosystem. Several unicorns - start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion ($1.4 billion) - are headquartered here: ride-sharing company Grab; e-commerce platform Lazada Group; gaming platform Sea; and gaming hardware maker Razer. All have landed major funding from big entities such as e-commerce giant Ali\u00adbaba Group Holding and growth equity investment firm General Atlantic.</p><p>Meanwhile, unicorn hopefuls are mushrooming daily in start-up workspaces such as Blk71 and BASH. The latter, short for Build Amazing Start-ups Here, was founded by IIPL and is now managed by SGInnovate. IIPL had helped fund the growth of many of these start-ups, both directly and through investments in accelerators and similar vehicles. Among them are a Singapore offshoot of UK start-up programme Entrepreneur First (EF) and a US$18 million early-stage investment fund called SeedPlus.</p><p>Last year, the value of private equity and VC deals transacted here hit its highest point since 2012. According to corporate finance adviser Duff &amp; Phelps, PE/VC investments grew to US$3.5 billion, driven largely by the technology sector. Among the notable deals was Softbank Group's investment in Grab, valued at US$750 million.</p><p>But Singapore's Southeast Asian neighbours are drawing major investments too. Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings has reportedly taken a stake in Indonesian ride-hailing company Go-Jek. And Alibaba's Ant Financial has invested in Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group's e-payment start-up Ascend Money. If Singapore hopes to compete for funds, talent and other economic benefits in an increasingly globalised tech world, it will need to run much faster.</p><p>\"There have been entrepreneurs in Singapore who thought the right approach was to take something that works somewhere else, do that here, but make it slightly better,\" Leonard says. \"But investors want to put money into start-ups that make [high returns]. If we are creating [start-ups] that are not difficult to copy, then this is not a great place for investment.\"</p><p>This is why Leonard is turning his attention to deep tech. While the term is not easily defined, it broadly refers to a subset of tech companies that are dedicated to solving big issues with the help of sophisticated solutions. Examples might include better diagnostic tools for the healthcare industry, data analytics to help farmers grow more food and cars that drive themselves. Among the most hotly talked-about deep tech fields is AI, which involves using mathematical solutions and software to do things such as recognise speech and pictures, process natural languages and make decisions.</p><p>Start-ups dabbling in deep tech tend not to receive as much attention - or money - as e-commerce plays, mobile payment systems or ride-sharing apps. That is partly because the field is difficult to understand and commercial advances may be many years away. But the potential rewards for investors and economies are significant (see \"The dollars in artificial intelligence\").</p><p>Leonard thinks, however, that Singa\u00adpore has an above-average chance of making a difference in these fields. The country has done a lot of research in AI and other deep tech fields, he says. In the local universities, in particular, a lot of expertise and knowledge has been accumulated in everything \"from sensors to decision-making to natural language to drive command\". SGInnovate hopes to turn some of this research into real-world applications.</p><p>'Like rolling a ball down the hill'</p><p>To do so, SGInnovate will build on the work of IIPL. It continues to support and invest in accelerators, which are in turn building start-ups of their own (see chart). Leonard and his team also work with researchers and corporate partners to help entrepreneurs \"who can imagine and build technology-intensive products\" and companies \"in which investors, including SGInnovate, would want to invest\". On some weeknights, it runs talks on blockchain or AI at its office on Carpenter Street. Among those who have spoken is Vitalik Buterin, who co-founded cryptocurrency Ethereum. A Russian programmer, Buterin currently resides in Singapore and has an office in SGInnovate's co-working space.</p><p>SGInnovate has an evergreen fund to invest in pre-seed to seed funding rounds for deep tech start-ups. It has backed 30 of them so far, including 11 of the 12 start-ups from EF Singapore's first programme this year. Among them are Transcelestial, a start-up that wants to rewire the telecommunications industry with nanosatellites; KroniKare, which is developing chronic wound diagnosis tools; and Hydroleap, which has found a cheaper and faster way to treat industrial water.</p><p>The aim of these investments is not so much to make money, but to grow the ecosystem. \"If we want to make [big] returns, then we would be making bets on a few opportunities. That is great for investors, but not ideal for the Singapore ecosystem,\" Leonard explains. SGInnovate's investments aim to cultivate more talent and create new technologies that would be relevant to global markets.</p><p>\"What SGInnovate wants to do is to think about where we can make the most difference in this ecosystem,\" says Leonard. \"I use the expression of a ball rolling down the hill. If you are standing at the top of the hill and pushing, that's something we can do. But when it starts rolling down the hill, they don't need us to keep pushing.\" If his efforts pay off, Leonard expects to see an increase of start-ups in AI by two to four times in the next few years.</p><p>Foo Tiang Lim, an operating partner at SeedPlus, says he welcomes SGInnovate's new focus. \"The change is good. SGInnovate's mission is more aligned with our investment strategies.\" SeedPlus is an early backer of Mimetic.ai, which powers an AI assis\u00adtant called Evie.</p><p>Overcoming hurdles</p><p>Should the government be spending the money to fund start-ups? Or should tech ecosystems be led purely by commercial interest and funding? And is AI even the right place for Singapore to start?</p><p>Leonard says it is a misconception that Silicon Valley developed organically, and that governments have no role to play in creating ecosystems. \"Sometimes, it is wrongly imagined by some people that, if the government is in by one centimetre, then the private sector is displaced by one centimetre,\" he says. \"Silicon Valley was in large part the [result] of the US government's at that time buying everything the early semiconductor manufacturers were making.\"</p><p>Industry players appear fairly confident in Leonard's plans. \"Few start-ups in Singapore are investing in deep tech and AI, so SGInnovate is building an important niche in this ecosystem that is currently not well explored,\" says Terence Fan, assistant professor at Singapore Management University.</p><p>Jeffrey Chi, vice-chairman of Vickers Venture Partners, points out that the NRF has already achieved a great deal. \"It is the Singapore government funding from NRF that spearheaded this recent boom in the venture market today. Other governments in the region followed after,\" Chi says. \"The companies [created through programmes such as SGInnovate] will also help drive Singapore's economy in the future.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, it will be uphill for Leonard in the beginning. For starters, there are not enough use cases by which to judge AI technologies. That makes it more difficult for investors to gauge the potential of these start-ups. \"But this is the nature of innovation. It seems like we are at an inflexion point in the adoption of AI,\" says Paul Santos, managing partner of Wavemaker Partners.</p><p>Singapore also lacks talent in this field, according to industry players. Vickers' Chi says, \"While there are a few Singaporeans who are fairly prominent in this field, most did not gain their experience in Singapore. We need somehow to develop the capabilities here in Singapore.\"</p><p>The lack of large sets of real world data is another challenge. Data-sharing is taking root in some sectors. The finance industry, for instance, is gradually opening up with the help of regulatory sandboxes. And some start-ups, such as medtech start-up Holmusk, are proactively sharing data with third parties. But most Singapore businesses are concerned that sharing their data would result in the loss of their competitive edge. Isaac Ho, founder of VentureCraft, says: \"This makes it harder for our local start-ups to compete with our neighbouring countries' businesses that have access to bigger data sets, owing to the population size.\"</p><p>If SGInnovate is able to overcome these hurdles successfully, the rewards may go beyond job creation and GDP growth. So far, the country's start-up ecosystem has had little success nurturing unicorns. Most local start-ups have been acquired post-Series A for less than US$50 million. Ultimately, the lack of home-grown unicorns has dampened the Singapore Exchange's ability to attract big tech listings.</p><p>Leonard says, \"In some cases, we are not building start-ups that deserve to be that much bigger, because they are thinking of a market that is somewhat constrained. The reality is we need to raise our expectations of [the types of] problems we work on.\"</p><p>He has not given up hope that the right start-ups are out there. He is a common sight at demo days and start-up pitches, and makes it a point to engage with the community - a practice he started while he was executive chairman of IDA. Before that, he held senior positions at software company Symantec and IT firm EMC.</p><p>Ever the pitchman, Leonard has yet another message: Singapore's start-ups need to work on big problems. And SGInnovate can help by making sure the people working on those issues have enough resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NWK-1KX1-DYX1-T533-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Edge Publishing PTE.

But after sending out over 1 million patriotic-themed messages, the enterprise was taken offline by anti-spam monitors employed by mobile phone giants. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser who wields vast control over the president's political apparatus, quickly reached out to Verizon and T-Mobile executives to inquire about initiating communication between the campaign and the companies in hopes of fixing the problem.</p><p>It took five days to resolve the shutdown, leading Republicans to worry the same thing could happen this fall as the president urges his supporters to vote, when the stakes will be much higher.</p><p>People familiar with the chain of events said Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T flagged potential regulatory problems with the peer-to-peer messaging operation, which differs from robo-texting in that texts are sent individually, as opposed to a mass blast. But within Trump's orbit, the episode has further fueled suspicions that big tech companies are looking to influence the election. In recent weeks, the president has accused Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative voices and son Donald Trump Jr. has alleged that Gmail is sending reelection campaign emails to spam folders.</p><p>\"A campaign's email and text messaging list are some of the most important assets they have in 2020,\" said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, adding that it was \"really very concerning to see that such a significant issue happened and to see that it wasn't resolved in a timely manner.\"</p><p>Representatives for the telecom companies declined to comment for the record. But people close to Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T said the decision was not made by them, but rather by third-party administrators they employ to monitor text messaging and protect consumers from spamming. They strenuously denied that there was any partisan intent and say they were merely following guidelines conveyed by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade group that represents mobile phone outfits.</p><p>The organization declined to specify what the Trump campaign had done wrong, but said in a statement, \"We expect all senders - whether airlines, schools, banks or campaigns - to include clear opt-out language and gain prior consent before sending a text.\"</p><p>\"These simple steps help protect consumers from spam and maintain text messaging as a trusted medium for everyone,\" it added.</p><p>Democrats also use text messaging in their campaigns, but the digitally focused Trump reelection effort is particularly emphasizing it. It has spent the past few years harvesting cellphone numbers, including from attendees to the president's trademark rallies. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic has ensured that voter outreach will be more digital - and text message-centered - than usual.</p><p>This month's operation was intended as a dry run to determine whether the texting program would run into problems - and to avoid reprising Mitt Romney's Election Day experience in 2012, when his lightly tested voter turnout program crashed as people headed to the polls. Come fall, the Trump political apparatus is looking to send tens of millions of messages to supporters prodding them to vote.</p><p>The problem was eventually ironed out after a series of conversations with the wireless companies and their third-party administrators. But the damage was already done. </p><p>The Independence Day message was get-out-the-vote-themed, but the resulting shutdown of the campaign's texting infrastructure also hampered donor outreach. While Republican officials declined to estimate exactly how much they had lost in prospective donations, they acknowledged it was likely substantial. Trump used the long holiday weekend to accuse liberals of conspiring to tear down monuments - the kind of red-meat messaging that typically fires up his small-donor base.</p><p>Republicans are calling it the latest in a string of decisions by tech titans that are hurting Trump.</p><p>Tim Cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, called the shutdown \"odd,\" especially while companies like Facebook and Lyft launch programs encouraging people to cast ballots this fall.</p><p>\"They're all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling,\" Cameron added.</p><p>The Trump campaign has previously faced pushback over its text messaging tactics. Three Minnesotans have filed a lawsuit alleging the reelection effort sent text messages without receiving consent. A federal judge last month denied the campaign's motion to dismiss the case. </p><p>The legal wrangling centers on a 1991 federal law which aims to shield consumers from a deluge of unwanted robocalls and texts. But changing technology has created ambiguities around the statute's requirements, and businesses with an interest in reaching out to people via text have called on the Federal Communications Commission to provide greater clarity.</p><p>More recently, the FCC has ruled that peer-to-peer texting does not require consent, as long as texts are sent individually and not by auto-dial or robo-dial. </p><p>Democrats, too, have run into problems. Last month, two Minnesota residents brought a class action lawsuit against Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign over what they said were routine spam texts to which they had never consented.</p><p>\"Peer-to-peer texting has quickly become a critical tool for Republicans and Democrats. Both sides agree, it's going to lead to more Americans voting, a great thing for our country,\" said Gary Coby, the Trump campaign's digital director. \"There is bipartisan commitment to continue working with mobile carriers and the entire mobile messaging industry to ensure the channel remains open and secure.\"</p><p>It's not the first sign of tension between Trump and the country's telecom heavyweights.</p><p>After failing to block AT&amp;T from buying CNN-owned Time Warner last year, Trump called for a boycott on the wireless giant, writing on Twitter that if \"people [stopped] using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN.\"</p><p>The president this spring cheered the retirement of longtime AT&amp;T executive Randall Stephenson, tweeting that, \"Anyone who lets a garbage 'network' do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!\"</p><p>Trump has yet to weigh in on the text message shutdown. But Republicans acknowledge it has left them rattled.</p><p>\"I understand that telecom might want to change the rules about how political campaigns operate on their platforms,\" Cameron said, a charge the telecom industry strenuously denies. \"But those changes should take place after the election, and once they're in place when you're in a period just a few months before the election, it's not the time to change them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-373277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-0DD1-JDJ6-K0RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1222\"/><timeReceived>8:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A test run of one of Donald Trump's most important voter-contact programs was abruptly shut down over the July 4 weekend, potentially costing the president millions of dollars in donations and raising alarms about whether the initiative will face roadblocks in the run-up to the election.    Trump\u2019s campaign used the weekend to test-drive its text messaging program, a cornerstone of its small-donor outreach and its voter turnout plan. But after sending out over 1 million patriotic-themed messages, the enterprise was taken offline by anti-spam monitors employed by mobile phone giants.      Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser who wields vast control over the president's political apparatus, quickly reached out to Verizon and T-Mobile executives to inquire about initiating communication between the campaign and the companies in hopes of fixing the problem.     It took five days to resolve the shutdown, leading Republicans to worry the same thing could happen this fall as the president urges his supporters to vote, when the stakes will be much higher.    People familiar with the chain of events said Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T flagged potential regulatory problems with the peer-to-peer messaging operation, which differs from robo-texting in that texts are sent individually, as opposed to a mass blast. But within Trump\u2019s orbit, the episode has further fueled suspicions that big tech companies are looking to influence the election. In recent weeks the president has accused Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative voices and first son Donald Trump Jr. has alleged that Gmail is sending reelection campaign emails to spam folders.     \u201cThey\u2019re all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling.\"     Tim Cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the NRSC       \u201cA campaign\u2019s email and text messaging list are some of the most important assets they have in 2020,\u201d said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist who worked on Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, adding that it was \u201creally very concerning to see that such a significant issue happened and to see that it wasn\u2019t resolved in a timely manner.\u201d    Representatives for the telecom companies declined to comment for the record. But people close to Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T said the decision was not made by them, but rather by third-party administrators they employ to monitor text messaging and protect consumers from spamming. They strenuously denied that there was any partisan intent and say they were merely following guidelines conveyed by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade group that represents mobile phone outfits.    The organization declined to specify what the Trump campaign had done wrong, but said in a statement, \u201cWe expect all senders \u2014 whether airlines, schools, banks or campaigns \u2014 to include clear opt-out language and gain prior consent before sending a text.\u201d    \u201cThese simple steps help protect consumers from spam and maintain text messaging as a trusted medium for everyone,\u201d it added.    Democrats also use text messaging in their campaigns, but the digitally focused Trump reelection effort is particularly emphasizing it. It has spent the last few years harvesting cell phone numbers, including from attendees to the president\u2019s trademark rallies. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic has ensured that voter outreach will be more digital \u2014 and text message-centered \u2014 than usual.    This month's operation was intended as a dry run to determine whether the texting program would run into problems \u2014 and to avoid reprising Mitt Romney\u2019s Election Day experience in 2012, when his lightly-tested voter turnout program crashed as people headed to the polls. Come fall, the Trump political apparatus is looking to send tens of millions of messages to supporters prodding them to vote.    The problem was eventually ironed out after a series of conversations with the wireless companies and their third-party administrators. But the damage was already done.    The Independence Day message was get-out-the-vote-themed, but the resulting shutdown of the campaign's texting infrastructure also hampered donor outreach. While Republican officials declined to estimate exactly how much they had lost in prospective donations, they acknowledged it was likely substantial. Trump used the long holiday weekend to accuse liberals of conspiring to tear down monuments \u2014 the kind of red-meat messaging that typically fires up his small donor base .    Republicans are calling it the latest in a string of decisions by tech titans that are hurting Trump.    Tim Cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, called the shutdown \u201codd,\u201d especially while companies like Facebook and Lyft launch programs encouraging people to cast ballots this fall.    \u201cThey\u2019re all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling,\u201d Cameron added.    The Trump campaign has previously faced pushback over its text messaging tactics. Three Minnesotans have filed a lawsuit alleging the reelection effort sent text messages without receiving consent. A federal judge last month denied the campaign\u2019s motion to dismiss the case.       The legal wrangling centers on a 1991 federal law which aims to shield consumers from a deluge of unwanted robocalls and texts. But changing technology has created ambiguities around the statute\u2019s requirements, and businesses with an interest in reaching out to people via text have called on the Federal Communications Commission to provide greater clarity.    More recently, the FCC has ruled that peer-to-peer texting does not require consent, as long as texts are sent individually and not by auto-dial or robo-dial.    Democrats, too, have run into problems. Last month, two Minnesota residents brought a class action lawsuit against Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign over what they said were routine spam texts to which they had never consented.    \u201cPeer-to-peer texting has quickly become a critical tool for Republicans and Democrats. Both sides agree, it's going to lead to more Americans voting, a great thing for our country,\u201d said Gary Coby, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director. \u201cThere is bipartisan commitment to continue working with mobile carriers and the entire mobile messaging industry to ensure the channel remains open and secure.\u201d    It\u2019s not the first sign of tension between Trump and the country\u2019s telecom heavyweights.    After failing to block AT&amp;T from buying CNN-owned Time Warner last year, Trump called for a boycott on the wireless giant, writing on Twitter that if \" people [stopped] using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN.\u201d    The president this spring cheered the retirement of longtime AT&amp;T executive Randall Stephenson, tweeting that, \u201cAnyone who lets a garbage \u2018network\u2019 do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!\"    Trump has yet to weigh in on the text message shutdown. But Republicans acknowledge it has left them rattled.    \u201cI understand that telecom might want to change the rules about how political campaigns operate on their platforms,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cBut those changes should take place after the election, and once they\u2019re in place when you\u2019re in a period just a few months before the election, it\u2019s not the time to change them.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42642881371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D9-8941-JCSC-J21B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apart from his cameo appearances every other day to talk up tech stocks or the next hot IPO, he had his own Friday evening co-host slot with \"Money</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Honey\" Maria Bartiromo on a programme called Market Week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few weeks before the bubble burst, Meeks popped into his neighbourhood Starbucks on a Saturday morning, following his appearance with Bartiromo the previous evening. \"I walk in and people were coming up to me asking for my autograph,\" he recalls. A year later, Meeks was being stalked by someone who had lost a ton of money on tech stocks. \"The guy kept calling me and calling me for two weeks and threatened to kill me,\" he tells The Edge Singapore. \"I went from being a much-loved TV celebrity to be being the most hated portfolio manager in the world with a death threat.\"</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index reached a record 5,048.62 points on March 10, 2000. Then, the tech stock barometer hit a slippery slope, falling\u00a078% over the next two years. Call it the end of irrational exuberance, bubble burst, Internet's \"tulip moment\" or whatever else, the tech darlings turned to dust, fortunes were wiped out, celebrity analysts, pundits and fund managers became objects of ridicule and even some of the better technology stocks were shunned by investors for years.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Nasdaq</p><p>has slowly crawled back up, weathering a road bump during the global financial crisis in 2008. On March 2, almost exactly 15 years after tech stocks last peaked, the Nasdaq crossed the 5,000 landmark once again. \"Once the bubble popped, I knew it would take a very long time before we got to anywhere near 5,000 again,\" Meeks said in a phone interview from Bellingham, Washington the day after the index reached the landmark again.</p><p>These days, Meeks runs the Sextant Growth Fund for Saturna Capital from its office in the Seattle suburbs. One of the world's better-known tech portfolio managers, Meeks grew up in Singapore and went to the United World College of Southeast Asia and Singapore American School. For nearly eight years, he lived in a Ridley Park bungalow in the Tanglin area while his dad was running Dow Chemicals' Southeast Asian operations. He returned to the US to finish high school, graduated from Williams College in 1985, earned an MBA from Kellogg School of Management in 1992 and then went on to work in Wall Street, first as an analyst and eventually as a portfolio manager.</p><p>What has driven the latest rally in tech stocks? Unlike the spectacu\u00adlar</p><p>run 15 years ago, when the Nasdaq's bull run was driven by speculative Internet stocks such as Pets.com\u00a0that had no revenues to speak of, the recent rally has been fuelled by tech giants that are among the world's most profitable companies. The biggest run-up over the past two years has been in stocks such as smartphone and tablet maker Apple, software giant Microsoft and microprocessor giant Intel, which have a huge cash hoard, pay dividends and are buying back shares in a big way. The three horsemen of the Nasdaq have been supported by search behemoth Google and networking giant Cisco as well as momentum names such as video streaming operator Netflix</p><p>and e-commerce giant Amazon.</p><p>\"The tech rally really started with central banks flooding the world with liquidity and, eventually, the money found its way into tech stocks,\" says Meeks. \"The Fed's easing and quantitative easing around the world - rather than any technology theme - has been the main driving force.\"</p><p>Is there a bubble in tech stocks that is about to burst? Is this time any different? In some ways, the Nasdaq 5,000 milestone is misleading. To reach its inflation-adjusted peak, the tech index will have to touch 6,950, or 40% above its current levels. Even then, it will not be an apples-to-apples comparison. The Nasdaq is now full of strong and growing tech firms such as Google that have a time-tested\u00a0business model. Moreover, tech itself has\u00a0evolved. Fifteen years ago, the world was still mostly on slow dial-up Internet through desktop PCs. These days, most people have the 1990s equivalent of a supercomputer in their pocket in the shape of a smartphone.</p><p>\"Although the valuation of tech stocks in general may appear historically stretched, they are still way below where they were 15 years ago at the height of the tech boom,\" says Meek. One reason for that, he adds, is that these days there is a much slower and more deliberate process to take tech companies public whereas, back in 1999 or 2000, the valuations were manifold higher than they are now.</p><p>The tech stock barometer traded at just over 100 times 12-month forward earnings in early March 2000. Last week, it was trading at 25 times 12-month forward earnings. In early 2000, tech IPOs were being done at an unprecedented 32 times annual revenues. Last year, Nasdaq tech IPOs were around five times revenues.</p><p>The way Meeks sees it, it is unlikely there will ever be a tech party like 1999. \"Since the bubble popped 15 years ago, there has been much more regulation,\" he says. \"While nobody can prevent all fraud and there will always be unscrupulous players doing bad things, it is now very difficult for an immature company with a bad business model to even get to the IPO process, let alone list on Nasdaq.\"</p><p>Moreover, these days, there is much more money available at the venture capital stage, which promising tech companies can access and through which they can grow the business over time without having to resort to a shotgun IPO just to stay afloat.</p><p>Between January and March 2000, the average age of tech start-ups filing for a Nasdaq IPO was less than four years. These days, start-ups can take up to 10 years before they get to the IPO stage. That means they have time to tweak their business model and build up a history of revenue, indeed even profit growth. \"Start-ups go through a series of fundraising or A, B, C, D rounds of private funding from venture capital and private equity as they build up their business,\" notes Meeks. \"These private companies publish annual income statements, cash flow statements and go through years of scrutiny before they reach the IPO stage. They have to do that for valuations for VCs [venture capitalists] or private investors, so people know a lot about the companies long before they are ready for a listing.\" The exhaustive process eliminates a lot of poor companies and bad business models, which was not the case in 2000, when every company was tested only in the listed arena.</p><p>Now that Nasdaq has topped 5,000, Meeks says there are compelling tech themes such as cloud computing, cyber security and Big Data analytics that will propel the tech barometer higher over the next few years. \"There are also older themes like social media and the mobile boom, which still have some runway left,\" he notes. \"The big tech themes and the markets that they represent are much, much larger than the markets we were talking about addressing back in 2000. People were rushing companies to IPO and nobody had a clue whether they'd ever be money makers.</p><p>\"Back then, it was about eyeballs, clicks and getting advertising to support those untested business models. The companies that are listing now have cash flow, tried-and-tested business models, and most, if not all, have track records of profitability. We have metrics like cost per click and paid clicks for Google and Baidu, but we have a better sense today on how companies can monetise Internet traffic, whether it is on desktop or smartphone.\"</p><p>Still, even Meeks concedes that he is seeing pockets of froth when it comes to tech companies in the public markets and lots of it in the private markets, particularly companies such as taxi operator Uber (current valuation US$41 billion [$56 billion]), room sharing network Airbnb (US$20 billion), online scrapbook operator Pinterest (US$11 billion) and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi (US$50 billion). \"Clearly, there are some crazy</p><p>valuations, and when I look at Xiaomi or Uber, I wonder how anyone can justify those ludicrous valuations,\" he says.</p><p>Instead of paying too much attention to the headline valuations of one or two companies, Meeks says investors need to look at the broader picture. \"You will always have one or two companies whose valuations appear grossly inflated. Back in 1999 and 2000, it was all-pervasive. Now, it is just one or two companies. You never know whether one of those companies will end up being a home run, but as long as such valuations are not pervasive, I wouldn't read too much into them.\"</p><p>Have we learnt anything from the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000? \"The lesson we learnt was, whether it's a tech or non-tech company, whether it is based in the US or Singa\u00adpore, you should be wary of investing, unless you are sure that it will generate cash,\" he says. \"Looking back, there were too many companies back then that didn't even have a proper long-term plan to generate</p><p>cash, that somehow got funded. These days, investors are much more careful about predicting cash flows and valuing those cash flows.</p><p>\"We are not in a bubble, but that's not to say we are not going to have corrections in this rally</p><p>as we go along. Whether it is a small correction or a sharp pullback will depend not just on what is going on in tech, but the overall market. It will depend on Russia, Ukraine, geopolitics, the price of oil, the pace of global recovery and growth in the US as well as valua\u00adtions.\"</p><p>So, how would he suggest investors play the latest tech rally? They should take a long-term view of the tech sector rather than try to time the market, he says. \"If you have a diversified portfolio of tech stocks you would do well as an investor over time,\" he says.</p><p>While his top tech sector picks are cloud computing, cyber security and Big Data analytics,</p><p>Meeks says many of the pure plays within those themes are now overcrowded trades. His current top stock pick is social networking operator Facebook. The stock has more than quadrupled from its August 2012 post-IPO lows. \"The company has a lot of potential and the stock is still cheap,\" he says. It pays to have a proper perspective. Fifteen years from now, Nasdaq at 5,000 would just be another number for tech investors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FTJ-X2Y1-DYX1-T0X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Apart from his cameo appearances every other day to talk up tech stocks or the next hot IPO, he had his own Friday evening co-host slot with \"Money</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Honey\" Maria Bartiromo on a programme called Market Week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few weeks before the bubble burst, Meeks popped into his neighbourhood Starbucks on a Saturday morning, following his appearance with Bartiromo the previous evening. \"I walk in and people were coming up to me asking for my autograph,\" he recalls. A year later, Meeks was being stalked by someone who had lost a ton of money on tech stocks. \"The guy kept calling me and calling me for two weeks and threatened to kill me,\" he tells The Edge Singapore. \"I went from being a much-loved TV celebrity to be being the most hated portfolio manager in the world with a death threat.\"</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index reached a record 5,048.62 points on March 10, 2000. Then, the tech stock barometer hit a slippery slope, falling\u00a078% over the next two years. Call it the end of irrational exuberance, bubble burst, Internet's \"tulip moment\" or whatever else, the tech darlings turned to dust, fortunes were wiped out, celebrity analysts, pundits and fund managers became objects of ridicule and even some of the better technology stocks were shunned by investors for years.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Nasdaq</p><p>has slowly crawled back up, weathering a road bump during the global financial crisis in 2008. On March 2, almost exactly 15 years after tech stocks last peaked, the Nasdaq crossed the 5,000 landmark once again. \"Once the bubble popped, I knew it would take a very long time before we got to anywhere near 5,000 again,\" Meeks said in a phone interview from Bellingham, Washington the day after the index reached the landmark again.</p><p>These days, Meeks runs the Sextant Growth Fund for Saturna Capital from its office in the Seattle suburbs. One of the world's better-known tech portfolio managers, Meeks grew up in Singapore and went to the United World College of Southeast Asia and Singapore American School. For nearly eight years, he lived in a Ridley Park bungalow in the Tanglin area while his dad was running Dow Chemicals' Southeast Asian operations. He returned to the US to finish high school, graduated from Williams College in 1985, earned an MBA from Kellogg School of Management in 1992 and then went on to work in Wall Street, first as an analyst and eventually as a portfolio manager.</p><p>What has driven the latest rally in tech stocks? Unlike the spectacu\u00adlar</p><p>run 15 years ago, when the Nasdaq's bull run was driven by speculative Internet stocks such as Pets.com\u00a0that had no revenues to speak of, the recent rally has been fuelled by tech giants that are among the world's most profitable companies. The biggest run-up over the past two years has been in stocks such as smartphone and tablet maker Apple, software giant Microsoft and microprocessor giant Intel, which have a huge cash hoard, pay dividends and are buying back shares in a big way. The three horsemen of the Nasdaq have been supported by search behemoth Google and networking giant Cisco as well as momentum names such as video streaming operator Netflix</p><p>and e-commerce giant Amazon.</p><p>\"The tech rally really started with central banks flooding the world with liquidity and, eventually, the money found its way into tech stocks,\" says Meeks. \"The Fed's easing and quantitative easing around the world - rather than any technology theme - has been the main driving force.\"</p><p>Is there a bubble in tech stocks that is about to burst? Is this time any different? In some ways, the Nasdaq 5,000 milestone is misleading. To reach its inflation-adjusted peak, the tech index will have to touch 6,950, or 40% above its current levels. Even then, it will not be an apples-to-apples comparison. The Nasdaq is now full of strong and growing tech firms such as Google that have a time-tested\u00a0business model. Moreover, tech itself has\u00a0evolved. Fifteen years ago, the world was still mostly on slow dial-up Internet through desktop PCs. These days, most people have the 1990s equivalent of a supercomputer in their pocket in the shape of a smartphone.</p><p>\"Although the valuation of tech stocks in general may appear historically stretched, they are still way below where they were 15 years ago at the height of the tech boom,\" says Meek. One reason for that, he adds, is that these days there is a much slower and more deliberate process to take tech companies public whereas, back in 1999 or 2000, the valuations were manifold higher than they are now.</p><p>The tech stock barometer traded at just over 100 times 12-month forward earnings in early March 2000. Last week, it was trading at 25 times 12-month forward earnings. In early 2000, tech IPOs were being done at an unprecedented 32 times annual revenues. Last year, Nasdaq tech IPOs were around five times revenues.</p><p>The way Meeks sees it, it is unlikely there will ever be a tech party like 1999. \"Since the bubble popped 15 years ago, there has been much more regulation,\" he says. \"While nobody can prevent all fraud and there will always be unscrupulous players doing bad things, it is now very difficult for an immature company with a bad business model to even get to the IPO process, let alone list on Nasdaq.\"</p><p>Moreover, these days, there is much more money available at the venture capital stage, which promising tech companies can access and through which they can grow the business over time without having to resort to a shotgun IPO just to stay afloat.</p><p>Between January and March 2000, the average age of tech start-ups filing for a Nasdaq IPO was less than four years. These days, start-ups can take up to 10 years before they get to the IPO stage. That means they have time to tweak their business model and build up a history of revenue, indeed even profit growth. \"Start-ups go through a series of fundraising or A, B, C, D rounds of private funding from venture capital and private equity as they build up their business,\" notes Meeks. \"These private companies publish annual income statements, cash flow statements and go through years of scrutiny before they reach the IPO stage. They have to do that for valuations for VCs [venture capitalists] or private investors, so people know a lot about the companies long before they are ready for a listing.\" The exhaustive process eliminates a lot of poor companies and bad business models, which was not the case in 2000, when every company was tested only in the listed arena.</p><p>Now that Nasdaq has topped 5,000, Meeks says there are compelling tech themes such as cloud computing, cyber security and Big Data analytics that will propel the tech barometer higher over the next few years. \"There are also older themes like social media and the mobile boom, which still have some runway left,\" he notes. \"The big tech themes and the markets that they represent are much, much larger than the markets we were talking about addressing back in 2000. People were rushing companies to IPO and nobody had a clue whether they'd ever be money makers.</p><p>\"Back then, it was about eyeballs, clicks and getting advertising to support those untested business models. The companies that are listing now have cash flow, tried-and-tested business models, and most, if not all, have track records of profitability. We have metrics like cost per click and paid clicks for Google and Baidu, but we have a better sense today on how companies can monetise Internet traffic, whether it is on desktop or smartphone.\"</p><p>Still, even Meeks concedes that he is seeing pockets of froth when it comes to tech companies in the public markets and lots of it in the private markets, particularly companies such as taxi operator Uber (current valuation US$41 billion [$56 billion]), room sharing network Airbnb (US$20 billion), online scrapbook operator Pinterest (US$11 billion) and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi (US$50 billion). \"Clearly, there are some crazy</p><p>valuations, and when I look at Xiaomi or Uber, I wonder how anyone can justify those ludicrous valuations,\" he says.</p><p>Instead of paying too much attention to the headline valuations of one or two companies, Meeks says investors need to look at the broader picture. \"You will always have one or two companies whose valuations appear grossly inflated. Back in 1999 and 2000, it was all-pervasive. Now, it is just one or two companies. You never know whether one of those companies will end up being a home run, but as long as such valuations are not pervasive, I wouldn't read too much into them.\"</p><p>Have we learnt anything from the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000? \"The lesson we learnt was, whether it's a tech or non-tech company, whether it is based in the US or Singa\u00adpore, you should be wary of investing, unless you are sure that it will generate cash,\" he says. \"Looking back, there were too many companies back then that didn't even have a proper long-term plan to generate</p><p>cash, that somehow got funded. These days, investors are much more careful about predicting cash flows and valuing those cash flows.</p><p>\"We are not in a bubble, but that's not to say we are not going to have corrections in this rally</p><p>as we go along. Whether it is a small correction or a sharp pullback will depend not just on what is going on in tech, but the overall market. It will depend on Russia, Ukraine, geopolitics, the price of oil, the pace of global recovery and growth in the US as well as valua\u00adtions.\"</p><p>So, how would he suggest investors play the latest tech rally? They should take a long-term view of the tech sector rather than try to time the market, he says. \"If you have a diversified portfolio of tech stocks you would do well as an investor over time,\" he says.</p><p>While his top tech sector picks are cloud computing, cyber security and Big Data analytics,</p><p>Meeks says many of the pure plays within those themes are now overcrowded trades. His current top stock pick is social networking operator Facebook. The stock has more than quadrupled from its August 2012 post-IPO lows. \"The company has a lot of potential and the stock is still cheap,\" he says. It pays to have a proper perspective. Fifteen years from now, Nasdaq at 5,000 would just be another number for tech investors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FPJ-R8S1-DYX1-T04R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Has pilot projects in Asia and the United States designed to help use roads and other public space more efficiently. The Intelligent Community Vehicle System is a car-sharing program that encourages members to use gasoline and battery-powered hybrid vehicles together with public transit and bicycles. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Toyota [59] </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The leader in hybrid engine technology. </p><p> The Prius mid-sized car is the most popular</p><p> hybrid vehicle in the world, with about 150,000</p><p> sold since its debut in Japan in 1997. Toyota is also a leader in technologies that help drivers avoid accidents, such as the headlights on the new Harrier SUV, which improve cornering at night by adjusting to the vehicle's speed and turning angle. </p><p> Daimler-Chrysler [53] </p><p> As of early 2004, none of the Big Three North American manufacturers had introduced a hybrid vehicle. DaimlerChrysler is concentrating on hydrogen-based fuel cell technology, which emits only water as waste. Owns about 17% of Vancouver-based Ballard Power Systems Inc., the leading fuel-cell developer. </p><p> Ford [53] </p><p> Scores highest in this industry group for employee programs and benefits, and for diversity management systems that aim to help women and minorities. Owns about 19% of Ballard Power Systems. </p><p>General Motors [51] </p><p> Over the past five years, GM North America has reduced waste from all of its operations by more than half through reduction and recycling. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT The major auto manufacturers are developing some models with higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions, such as hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles. The automakers have also worked hard to reduce defects, and to improve performance and safety. Much of the focus is now on what industry consulting firms such as J.D. Power &amp; Associates call \"active\" safety (helping drivers avoid accidents) rather than \"passive\" safety (trying to protect them in the event of accidents). </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK Safety and the environment remain the big problem areas, and a lot of that stems from trucks and SUVs. </p><p> Smaller cars are easier to handle and better for avoiding accidents. Yet manufacturers continue to introduce new large models because of their high profit margins. The safety scandal over the Ford Explorer SUV and Bridgestone/Firestone tires shows what can go wrong. For four years, the two companies have faced civil and class-action lawsuits throughout North and Latin America as a result of roll-over accidents following tire tread separation during the late '90s. </p><p> Big vehicles are also gas guzzlers and emit more pollutants, but large-scale production of greener vehicles in North America over the next decade seems unlikely. That would require tougher government standards for emissions and fuel efficiency, and major shifts in consumer demand. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Despite some improvements in fuel efficiency and product safety, the industry has undercut its own efforts at improvement by introducing too many higher-margin-yet more harmful-large vehicles. </p><p> Banking </p><p> CIBC [60] </p><p> The largest charitable contributor among the Big Six banks in 2003, donating $46 million (more than 2% of net income). Considers environmental impact when selecting suppliers and vendors. </p><p>Royal Bank [60] </p><p> The only Canadian bank besides CIBC (and one of 19 major banks worldwide) to adopt the Equator Principles, a set of voluntary social and environmental guidelines for financing projects in developing countries. </p><p>Bank of Nova Scotia [56] </p><p>Scotia Capital has the best record among the bank-owned brokerages in recent years when it comes to disciplinary actions, penalties and related legal actions by both industry groups and government regulators. </p><p>Bank of Montreal [55] </p><p> A leader in employment-equity programs in this group. However, BMO Nesbitt Burns ranks worst among the bank-owned brokerages in terms of disciplinary measures, penalties and related legal actions over the past five years. </p><p>National Bank of Canada [46] </p><p> The only major Canadian bank that hasn't formally endorsed the UN Environmental Program's Statement by Financial Institutions on the Environment and Sustainable Development. </p><p>TD Bank [44] </p><p> Had to address 10 shareholder governance proposals in the management proxy circular for its 2003 annual meeting. The board supported the proposals \"in principle,\" but recommended voting against each of them. As with many banks, executive compensation is an issue. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT The Big Six banks are increasingly open about their operations. Since 2002, they've been required to publish annual accountability statements, including detailed information on charitable giving, accessibility initiatives, support for small businesses and branch closures. Most of the banks have reported on environmental practices as well, even though that isn't required. </p><p> Relative to other industries, the banks have a large number of women in management and on their boards. All of the banks have employment equity and diversity programs to develop more representative workforces. </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK Each of the major banks has had employees at brokerage operations disciplined in recent years through fines and dismissals by industry groups and securities regulators. In some cases, the operations themselves have been subject to legal actions and penalties. </p><p> Customer access is another sore point. For years, activists complained that low-income Canadians and recent immigrants faced systemic barriers to basic banking services. In 2001, the federal government passed Bill C-8, which requires banks to offer low-fee personal accounts and accounts without minimum initial deposits or minimum balances. </p><p> Although banks aren't required to disclose their loan portfolios, lending to companies with poor social or environmental records-or those involved in other questionable activities-has created controversies. Often those relationships come to light only after public investigations, as was the case last year when CIBC paid $80 million (U.S.) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle allegations that it helped Enron Corp. mislead investors. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Banks have direct and potentially significant exposure to social and environmental risks, yet they have made few operational changes to address the matter. Also, lack of detail on lending and underwriting remains a serious problem. Still, the big banks are reliable corporate citizens who have recently disclosed more information in some areas. </p><p> Food and Beverage </p><p>Sleeman Breweries [53] All brewers participate in provincial reuse and recycling programs that date back to 1927. In Ontario, Molson, Labatt and Sleeman co-own the Brewer's Retail distribution monopoly, which recovers 99% of bottles (each one is reused 15 to 20 times), 98% of packaging and 83% of cans. Sleeman also has a good record on limiting emissions and wastewater discharge. Leads this industry group in employee relations and has excellent health benefits and safety-management programs. Has formal employment equity policies, but marks off for no women on its board or in senior management. </p><p> Vincor International [53] </p><p> This producer and marketer of wines has strong corporate governance provisions, including a code of conduct for officers and directors (a majority of its directors are independent). Scores well in health and safety, but has the weakest employee diversity record in the group. </p><p> Molson [51] </p><p> A leader in community relations, Molson donated about $3.5 million to charity in 2003, or more than 2% of its pretax profits. Lags behind others on corporate governance. Has the least democratic share structure-the Molson family has control through multiple-voting shares-and the highest executive compensation. </p><p> Corby Distilleries [46] </p><p> One-third of directors and senior managers are women, including president and CEO Krystyna Hoeg. Reporting on social and environmental issues is notably poor. Corporate governance impaired by a dual-class share structure. </p><p> Cott [44] </p><p> Above average in employee relations and diversity; poorest in this group in corporate governance. Social and environmental reporting is weak, and government environmental standards are not always met. </p><p> Saputo [44] </p><p> Poor environmental audit practices and performance record. Several violations of government standards over the past five years, mainly for exceeding effluent-discharge permit limits. </p><p> Maple Leaf Foods [43] </p><p> The worst environmental compliance in the group and a poor labour relations record. Strong on corporate governance. One of the few companies in the group to participate in the national Voluntary Challenge and Registry program on climate change. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> What it's doing right There are isolated successes in some sub-groups-such as the brewers' bottle and packaging reuse and recycling programs-and in individual companies. </p><p> Still needs work Some of the companies in this group face environmental and labour relations issues, many related to health and safety. American competition, in particular, has put downward pressure on wages and weakened job security at some companies, leading to confrontations between unions and management. </p><p> Packaging is a major environmental problem. While the brewers are reusing and recycling, the soft drink industry has shifted away from returnable bottles and aluminum cans, and has increased its use of plastic containers, which have a much lower recovery value than cans and are far harder to recycle. </p><p> For some companies, reducing emissions remains a challenge. This is particularly true of Maple Leaf and Saputo, the two food producers in this group. Last year, Ontario's Environment Ministry charged Maple Leaf's Rothsay Rendering subsidiary with 16 infractions in connection with discharges of wastewater into a stream that flows through conservation area trout ponds near Hamilton. </p><p> The few companies that offer environmental reporting do so in a brief and vague manner. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Over all, this is a motley crew. Some companies have taken modest steps forward, but others appear to have little interest in the social and environmental issues associated with their operations. </p><p> Food Distribution </p><p> George Weston/ Loblaw [45] </p><p> Performs relatively well in employee relations-having the best benefits and diversity record in this industry group-and a mostly decent relationship with unions. Weston also has a strong environmental management system. But product safety and labelling are problems for both Loblaw and parent company Weston, which is also a large food producer. In fact, Weston is a leading North American producer of farmed salmon, and its aquaculture and seafood operations have paid $1.2 million in environmental penalties over the past five years. </p><p>Canada Safeway [44] </p><p> The only company in the group to publish a public environmental report, but the chain's relationship with unionized workers is the poorest. </p><p> Metro [44] </p><p> An average performer in most areas. Strong on diversity, with a diversity plan at its Econogros division and a higher-than-average level of female representation (three out of 13) on its board of directors. </p><p> A&amp;P [43] </p><p> Women hold four of the board's nine seats-a high ratio for any industry. Environmental performance is mediocre, and A&amp;P's overall health and safety record is the poorest in this group. </p><p> Empire/Sobeys [43] </p><p> Good corporate governance despite a dual-class share structure with multiple-voting shares that maintain the Sobey family's control. </p><p> Poor relationship with its unionized workers. </p><p> Alimentation Couche-Tard [38] </p><p> Weak in corporate governance and environmental issues, with no reports of any environmental management system or any initiatives to reduce or recycle waste. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT All retailers in the group have responded to public concern over food ingredients and the environment by introducing items such as organic produce, recycled paper products and less environmentally harmful detergents. Also, some chains have a strong record on employee diversity and promoting women. </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK Controversies over ingredients and product labelling continue to dog the industry, particularly the issue of genetically modified foods. Loblaw has been the focus of public controversy over forbidding suppliers to label products as \"GM-free.\" The company says that, in the absence of government standards, the claims may be false. George Weston also faced heat as a food producer recently because of its Heritage Salmon subsidiary, which produces 1 in 5 farmed salmon in North America. Environmentalists worry about the impact of salmon farming on the ocean and on wild salmon. Also, a recent study reported significantly higher-and potentially harmful-concentrations of organochlorines in farmed salmon than in wild ones. Other environmental worries in the sector include excessive and non-recyclable packaging and waste management. </p><p> Employee relations are a perennial problem for grocery chains, especially around working conditions and health and safety. Competition from non-food retailers is intensifying. Downward pressure on wages, benefits and job security is increasing as well. Supermarkets are also relying more and more on part-time workers, whose wages and benefits are lower than those of full-timers. </p><p> Human rights in developing countries are also a growing concern with consumers, but companies aren't addressing the issue yet. All the supermarkets stock coffee, sugar and other products from countries in which working conditions are poor. Higher-priced \"fair trade\" versions of many products are available, but none of the chains has committed itself to them, although at least one Canadian corporation-Van Houtte Inc.-offers \"fair trade\" coffee. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> None of the companies can be called a corporate social responsibility leader. Issues related to consumer choice-such as GM foods-are likely to intensify in the future, and these companies need to take more initiative. </p><p> Forestry </p><p> Tembec [58] </p><p> Vows to have all its forestry operations certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, an international body that includes industry and environmental groups, by 2005. As of last December, more than 20% of Tembec's forests were certified. Some of the company's pulp and paper operations still have problems complying with environmental regulations. (More on page 66.) </p><p> Nexfor [55] </p><p> Became the first major Canadian forest products company to publish an environmental report (1990). Includes a comprehensive section on the environment and health and safety in its annual report, and posts information on its website. Still, the reporting lacks detail on community relations. </p><p> Cascades [54] </p><p> Through its 45% ownership of Boralex Inc., this pulp and paper company is involved in alternative energy production, including wind and wood-residue thermal power. But Cascades' environmental reporting is meagre. </p><p> Weldwood [54] </p><p> Has a comprehensive code of business ethics that applies to all employees. The code includes core company values and outlines how employees should treat each other, customers, suppliers and communities in which the company operates. </p><p> Norske Skog [51] </p><p> Searches of government records show no convictions or financial penalties for violating environmental regulations at any time over the past five years. </p><p> Canfor [49] </p><p> Relatively large number of women at high levels-three of 14 directors and three of 13 officers are female. However, Canfor does not have an employment equity policy and has not implemented formal programs to encourage the advancement of women, visible minorities and other under-represented groups. </p><p> Domtar [49] </p><p> Signed an agreement with World Wildlife Fund Canada in November, 2003, in which Domtar agreed to certify all of its forests and mills under Forest Stewardship Council standards. Over the past five years, government records show Domtar has paid the most in health and safety penalties of any company in this industry group-more than $300,000. </p><p> Abitibi-Consolidated [47] </p><p> The largest recycler of newspapers and magazines in North America, and the largest newspaper recycler in the world. Still embroiled in a long dispute with the Grassy Narrows First Nation over the impact of logging near Kenora, Ont. </p><p> West Fraser Timber [39] </p><p> None of the company's 10 directors or 11 officers is female. </p><p> Lack of disclosure also contributed to the company's low score. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> What it's doing right The industry has recognized the need to harvest forests in a more sustainable manner. Some companies have committed to the rigorous Forest Stewardship Council standards for practices, developed by a broad international coalition that, in Canada, includes Greenpeace and Tembec. The standards also have support from some retailers. The industry, including the pulp and paper producers, is getting better at recycling. </p><p> Still needs work Most companies still choose an easier road by agreeing to meet guidelines developed either by Canada's provincial forestry ministers (Canadian Standards Association) or the U.S. timber trade association (Sustainable Forestry Initiative). Many environmental groups and other organizations say those guidelines aren't strong enough. Companies are also moving into more environmentally sensitive areas to get new timber. Compared with other resource producers, major forestry companies have a poor record on consulting local communities and First Nations. Only a few have formal consultation processes, and benefits-sharing agreements are rare. </p><p> Pulp mills have made some progress in limiting pollution, but too many still have problems meeting current standards. Mills are also insatiable freshwater users, and can seriously harm fish habitats by reducing water levels or altering temperatures.</p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> The industry has made progress toward developing a more sustainable business, but there's a lack of consensus on the appropriate environmental certification standards. </p><p> Insurance </p><p> Manulife Financial [61] </p><p> Issues detailed reports of its charitable giving, including names of some funded projects and organizations. Score suffers because of high compensation for CEO Dominic D'Alessandro, who received $8.8 million (including stock options) in 2002, highest among companies in this group. </p><p> Industrial Alliance [59] </p><p> Corporate governance record is strong. Thirteen of 15 directors are independent. Has formal code of conduct. </p><p> Sun Life [54] Donated 1% of pretax profits to charity in 2002, tied with SSQ for the highest level in this group. Total donations were $10.7 million. </p><p> Desjardins Financial [53] </p><p> The only company in the group that has not split the jobs of chairman and CEO. </p><p> SSQ, Financial [49] </p><p> Has a higher proportion of women senior managers than other companies in this group. </p><p> Great-West Life [46] </p><p> Tied with Desjardins and Manulife for the best employee diversity programs in this group. However, Great-West and its London Life subsidiary have been hit the hardest by lawsuits related to policies that promised so-called vanishing premiums. Both have also paid fines and settlements over disputed insurance claims. </p><p> Maritime Life [44] </p><p> Committed to donating 1% of average pretax profit to charity, the same percentage as Sun Life and SSQ, but doesn't provide actual donations figures. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> What it's doing right Relative to most other industries, insurers have a high proportion of women in management and on their boards, along with good employment equity practices. Unlike the banks, the insurers are not subject to the federal Employment Equity Act, which requires annual reports on progress toward achieving a representative workforce. But many insurers have formal policies and programs in place. </p><p> Like the banks, several Canadian insurance companies are large enough that they're required to issue annual public accountability statements under federal rules that apply to financial institutions. In those statements, the insurers must outline the economic and community impact of their operations, including total charitable donations and taxes paid. Within this group, that includes Maritime Life, Sun Life and Great-West. Manulife and Sun Life also include information on environmental issues, even though it's not required. </p><p> Still needs work One big potential problem for insurers is their loans or investments in businesses and countries with low social or environmental standards. Like banks, insurers aren't required to disclose their investment and loan portfolios. But, at least so far, the insurers haven't been grilled as hard as the banks. </p><p> The insurers aren't moving very quickly on their own. No company in this group has endorsed the United Nations Environmental Program's Statement of Environmental Commitment for the Insurance Industry or adopted the Equator Principles on environmental and social risk in project financing. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Like the banks, insurers have relatively strong employment equity practices. But much of the social and environmental impact of their operations depends on their loan and investment portfolios. More disclosure is needed. </p><p> Mining </p><p> Alcan [61] </p><p> A leading recycler of aluminum worldwide: In 2001 and 2002, recycled aluminum from consumers made up nearly 40% of the metal processed by Alcan's plants. Recycling saves energy as well. Alcan has also set company targets for reducing climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (a carcinogen). </p><p> Noranda [55] </p><p> Longest history in the group of reporting on environmental and health and safety issues, including public reports on fines and non-compliance with regulations. Falconbridge, Noranda's 60%-owned nickel subsidiary, aims to reduce wastewater from production by 50% by 2005. However, Noranda shares the poorest score in the group, with Teck Cominco, for overall health and safety. </p><p> Teck Cominco [50] </p><p> A leader in the group in community consultation initiatives, such as a program in Trail, B.C., to reduce children's exposure to lead. Has paid the most in environmental penalties among group companies over the past five years, including some related to tailings and fuel spills at Canadian and U.S. operations. </p><p> Inco [46] Has significantly improved its reporting on environmental and health and safety performance. However, Inco is Canada's largest emitter of airborne nickel, including sulphur dioxide and a significant emitter of other pollutants. Also has a poor community relations record at home and abroad. New Caledonia is one recent trouble spot-local Kanaks fear the environmental impact of Inco's Goro nickel project and say the company has not consulted with them. </p><p> Fording Canadian Coal Trust [38] </p><p> The only company in the group that does not publish a public report on its environmental performance. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT Most large mining companies have responded to public pressure by trying to reduce pollution and implementing formal environmental, health and safety management systems and programs. Almost all of these companies issue reports on these issues and community relations performance. </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK The environment, community relations and health and safety remain sore spots. Too often, companies address these issues only when they're required to by public pressure or government policies. </p><p> The industry has left hundreds of hazardous abandoned mines. Taxpayers often have to pick up the tab for cleanups, and governments are now under more pressure to demand financial guarantees from companies for reclamation costs. </p><p> Despite some improvements, many companies still tend to dig in their heels when dealing with local communities. This can backfire. Inco, for example, has had its reputation tarnished by a bitter fight with residents of Port Colborne, Ont., over elevated nickel levels in soil. Boliden Inc., a Canadian and Swedish company, had to spend $107 million (U.S.) to clean up after a tailings pond from a zinc mine in Spain burst and sent toxic sludge over about 2,500 acres of farmland and countryside in 1998. </p><p> Many ore deposits are in countries with poor human rights records-some in war zones. Companies are under pressure to adopt management systems that address those issues, as well as bribery and corruption.</p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Mining, by definition, is unsustainable. The industry needs to reinvent itself by moving away from primary metal extraction, adopting more environmentally friendly practices and placing more emphasis on metal recycling. This won't happen any time soon. </p><p> Oil and Gas </p><p>Suncor Energy [66] </p><p> Established itself as a Canadian and world leader in 2000 by committing $100 million over five years to green energy, including investments in large wind power projects in Saskatchewan and southern Alberta. </p><p> Very supportive of aboriginal and M{Zcaron}tis communities, including programs for small business, employment and education. Scores poorly, however, against competitors on greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> Petro-Canada [63] </p><p> The best performer in this group in terms of greenhouse gas emissions management systems. In December, Petrocan extended a five-year, $33-million partnership to help Ottawa-based Iogen Corp. develop a commercially viable means of turning corn and cereal into ethanol. </p><p> Imperial Oil [53] </p><p> Known as Esso at the pumps, Imperial has moved from being one of the worst performers with respect to sulphur levels in gasoline to the best. It's the first Canadian company to comply with federal regulations to produce low-sulphur fuel at refineries by 2005. However, Imperial has been slow to clean up contaminated sites, often fighting legal battles rather than complying with orders immediately. </p><p>Shell Canada [53] </p><p> The glass ceiling has been shattered at Shell by CEO Linda Cook and CFO Cathy Williams. Has problems with environmental compliance- </p><p> government records show about $600,000 in penalties over the past five years. </p><p> Husky Energy [49] </p><p> Only company in the group not to release environmental or sustainability </p><p> reports. Like Imperial Oil, Husky has no women senior officers. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT Producing fossil fuels and burning them is inherently harmful to the environment, but most oil and gas producers are at least trying to reduce the damage. Suncor, in particular, is going the extra mile by making major investments in alternative energy sources. Also, in 1999, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers launched its stewardship initiative, which encourages companies to improve their environmental and health and safety performance. The association publishes industry-wide data on several key indicators and has established performance benchmarks for companies. </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK Current and planned oil sands operations in northern Alberta are among the most energy-intensive-and thus greenhouse-gas-intensive-ways of getting oil from the ground. Expansion could make it more difficult for Canada to meet targets under the Kyoto Protocol. </p><p> Conventional oil and gas reserves across the western provinces are waning, so the industry is looking to develop new sources in the Arctic and off the coast of British Columbia, where the province is asking Ottawa to lift a 30-year moratorium on drilling. In both areas, this could disrupt delicate ecosystems. It will also require negotiations with local native communities. In B.C., the Haida First Nation has launched a legal action claiming ownership of the Queen Charlotte Islands and surrounding waters. </p><p> Companies are also looking overseas, where Petro-Canada, in particular, has greatly increased production. Human rights may become an issue in some countries. The saga of Talisman Energy, which sold its interests in war-torn Sudan after years of controversy, shows how badly things can go wrong. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> The industry's basic business will inevitably damage habitats, generate harmful emissions and exacerbate climate change. Resource extraction is also, by nature, unsustainable. Companies have been generally unwilling to face these realities, but they must now use profits to aggressively speed the transition to alternative and renewable energy sources. </p><p> Retail </p><p>Hudson's Bay [60] </p><p> A leader in this industry group in corporate governance, environment and addressing sweatshop labour issues. Has programs to increase energy efficiency and improve employees' environmental awareness. </p><p> Has a strong human-rights code of conduct for suppliers and the best mechanisms to monitor compliance. The Bay now issues an extensive annual corporate social responsibility (CSR) report. </p><p>Sears Canada [52] </p><p> Code of ethics and buying policies address human rights better than most companies in the group, but mechanisms to monitor compliance lag. Does not issue public human rights or CSR reports. Customer record has been tarnished by recent Competition Bureau allegations of deceptive advertising. </p><p> Rates high on corporate governance and the environment, having implemented energy efficiency and waste reduction programs. </p><p> Canadian Tire [49] </p><p> Stands out for environmental performance in recycling and waste reduction programs. Strong employee benefits. Weak on corporate governance because of its dual-class share structure. </p><p> Shoppers Drug Mart [43] </p><p> A leader in corporate donations, giving almost 4% of pretax profits in fiscal 2001 and 2002. Worst score in the group for corporate governance-just three of 12 directors are independent. </p><p>Costco [42] </p><p> Scores above average on employee relations, but has the worst environmental compliance record in this group. </p><p> Forzani [42] </p><p> Strong programs in employee benefits and health and safety. Like any major sporting goods retailer, Forzani has exposure to labour and human rights issues through its suppliers. Does not report any initiatives in this area. </p><p> Jean Coutu [42] </p><p> Has the strongest female representation in this group on its board of directors (five out of 16) and in senior management (four out of 17), but scores relatively poorly in employee programs and benefits. </p><p> Rona [36] </p><p> Performs reasonably well in corporate governance but poorly in other areas. Lack of reporting a key issue. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> What it's doing right It's hard for retailers to avoid the charge that suppliers, particularly those in developing countries, use sweatshop labour. In response to those concerns and others, Hudson's Bay now publishes an annual corporate social responsibility report. As well, some retailers have modest management systems in place to deal with those issues. </p><p> STILL NEEDS WORK Labour problems among manufacturers in developing countries are still widespread, including low wages, forced overtime, and poor health and safety standards. Campaigns by labour groups and shareholder activists have targeted clothing and shoe manufacturers, but abuses are also common in other industries. Four of the eight companies in this group-Forzani, Jean Coutu, Rona and Shoppers Drug Mart-do not report having policies or monitoring systems for suppliers. </p><p> Canadian retailers that have systems in place aren't doing as well as some of their international counterparts. Companies such as Nike, the Gap, Reebok and Adidas have been embroiled in controversies in the past and are now more responsive on these issues. Hudson's Bay has been criticized for cutting ties with a Lesotho-based clothing supplier because of labour rights abuses, rather than trying to help improve conditions, as other major retailers have done. </p><p> Customer issues (including product safety and marketing practices), employee relations and environmental issues can be costly and contentious for retailers as well. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> Some retailers have addressed human rights and other issues with suppliers, but even the best performers in this group lag behind their international counterparts. Half the group appears to have done nothing at all. Much progress is needed. </p><p> Technology </p><p>Hewlett-Packard [75] </p><p> A world leader in developing systems to measure and improve the environmental impact of products and processes. Has developed criteria to measure its suppliers' performances in areas such as the environment and health and labour practices. Will soon require suppliers to report annually on compliance. A strong contingent of women on the board and in senior management, including CEO Carly Fiorina. Policies on suppliers' labour practices still fall short of those of leaders in the shoe and clothing industries. </p><p>Siemens [66] </p><p> Publishes a detailed annual corporate responsibility report on citizenship and the environment. Also has comprehensivle policies and programs to in place to promote the advancement of women and minorities. Progress has been marred by complaints of sexual discrimination at a plant in Virginia. </p><p>Nortel Networks [61] </p><p> Has implemented employment equity and workplace harassment policies in all operations. Launched its Affirmative Procurement Program in 1980 to encourage subcontracting to minority- and women-owned businesses. </p><p>Xerox [61] </p><p> Has the highest level of charitable giving in this industry group and received the top score for waste management. In 2002, Xerox treated 97% of hazardous waste through recycling, treatment or fuel blending. </p><p> Celestica [52] </p><p> Ranks among the worst in this group for environmental reporting. </p><p> Does not publish an environmental report.</p><p>General Electric [48] </p><p> Environmental reporting is among the best in this group-every week, each GE facility completes an environmental and health and safety checklist. Audits suppliers as well. Health and safety record is poor-SEC filings show GE has paid more than $3 million (U.S.) in penalties worldwide over the past five years. </p><p> Bombardier [44] </p><p> Receives some marks for manufacturing rail equipment, which is less harmful to the environment than cars and trucks. Government records show more than $575,000 in penalties over the past five years for health and safety violations. </p><p> Rogers Wireless [42] </p><p> Environmental management systems are limited, and the company does not publish an environmental report or provide information on its website. </p><p>ATI Technologies [39] </p><p> Scores poorly on corporate governance. Share dilution rate from the company stock option plan is the highest in this group. K.Y. Ho, chairman and CEO, faces an investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission on allegations of insider trading, and ATI recently settled U.S. shareholder class-action lawsuits. </p><p> The Industry </p><p> What it's doing right Manufacturing and running tech equipment often involves large amounts of energy and water, and hundreds of hazardous substances. Disposing of waste and old equipment can be very difficult. Yet the multinationals that top this group are global leaders in environmental stewardship and in reporting. Hewlett-Packard, in particular, is trying to minimize damage at all stages of a product's life cycle. </p><p>HP and other top companies in the group are also making progress on employee diversity, labour practices and other social responsibility issues, and are issuing reports. </p><p> Still needs work Most big tech companies have exposure to human rights issues through their own overseas operations and through suppliers. Only a few leaders in the industry are addressing them. So far, they have avoided the public protests directed at clothing and shoe manufacturers such as the Gap and Nike. All of them can expect increased outside pressure to disclose and verify their practices. </p><p> Aside from Nortel Networks, Canadian companies in the group score poorly on several indicators. This is due to a lack of programs and policies, as well as a lack of reporting at several companies. </p><p> Bottom Line </p><p> The best companies in the tech sector are global leaders in environmental stewardship and reporting on social responsibility issues. But the laggards in the group are far behind. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illustration</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20040227RO3CORP2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4KX5-4110-TXJ2-N2KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Ten years on, platforms such as Google and Facebook are being mocked for their callousness on data privacy and the spread of misinformation. The New York Times described the 2010s as \u00e2  the decade tech lost its way\u00e2 . Ironically, the decade had begun with the \u00e2  Arab Spring\u00e2  and social media was hailed as an enabler of democracy and freedom of expression. As the curtain fell on tech\u00e2  s \u00e2  decade horribilis\u00e2 , there is again hope that it might yet deliver on its promise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are some of the things that are likely to define the next 10 years in tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulation</p><p>Around the world, regulators are taking a hard look at the business practices of Big Tech firms such as social media supremo Facebook, iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce powerhouse Amazon.com, software behemoth Microsoft and search giant Google\u00e2  s owner Alphabet, or the so-called FAAMA. (An older acronym FAANG, which included streaming giant Netflix, is now seen as outdated as Walt Disney, Apple and Amazon have been chipping away at its lead). Tech\u00e2  s Big Five now have a combined market capitalisation of over US$5.04 trillion. Over the past decade, the total market value of the five has risen sevenfold. Yet, tech honchos were not busy popping champagne corks this past holiday season to celebrate how much value they have created. Tech giants are in the crosshairs for sucking everything into their vortex, abusing their powers, collecting too much information about us without our approval and then monetising our data to boost their already hefty bottom lines.</p><p>Detractors have dubbed the top five as unregulated monopolies. Google has a near-monopoly on search-based advertising. With its control of Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook is the dominant social media platform accused of spreading disinformation, weaponising racial hatred, using voter suppression tactics and is increasingly seen as a threat to democracy. It is not just left wing US presidential candidates who want Google and Facebook on a tighter leash. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice, several US states as well as congressional committees have initiated inquiries into their anti-competitive behaviour. Moreover, the European Union has imposed US$7 billion in fines on Google over the past four years and more penalties are likely.</p><p>Google and Facebook algorithms have destroyed the media industry by soaking up a huge portion of global advertising with their hammerlock on the market through programmatic ads. Amazon has disrupted retail, cloud services and logistics, yet still thrives on selling unsafe products on its platform while using its near-monopolistic power to strong-arm competitors and suppliers. FTC is looking into Facebook\u00e2  s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp and there have also been calls to break up Google, which acquired YouTube for a song a decade ago.</p><p>Breaking up the tech giants will not be easy. It could take up to a decade, perhaps longer, to level the playing field, even if there was political will. Action is needed because the tech giants continue to stifle competition and innovation. If we want to see the sort of value creation in tech over the next decade that we saw over the last, regulators need to put their foot down and create an environment where a thousand unicorns, or private tech firms valued over a billion dollars, bloom. It would be wise not to bet against big tech. While it is possible that one or two tech giants might falter, or indeed break up, the rest will become even bigger and more powerful.</p><p>Splinternet</p><p>Despite the recent trade truce between Washington and Beijing, the ongoing US-China cold war and the battle for tech supremacy will eventually lead to two separate technologies \u00e2 \" one dominated by China and the other by companies in the Western world. Unfortunately, the rest of the world will have a stark choice: Back one or the other. Will Asians use Google\u00e2  s Android and Apple\u00e2  s iOS or the new mobile operating system that Huawei is working on? Will Malaysians, Singaporeans and Indonesians search on Google or on Baidu, or use WeChat\u00e2  s search engine? Will they order goods from one of Alibaba\u00e2  s platform companies or Amazon? Will they listen to music on Spotify, Apple Music or switch to Tencent Music? Will they use ApplePay, Google Pay or Alibaba\u00e2  s Alipay or Tencent\u00e2  s WeChat Pay? Will they use Microsoft Windows or Apple\u00e2  s MacOS or a Chinese operating system to run their PCs? Will they tweet on Twitter or Sina Weibo, watch videos on YouTube or Youku Tudou?</p><p>Washington also wants to prevent Chinese firms from buying US-sourced technology components, investing in US tech firms as well as exporting its tech products to the US. Beijing is not taking it lying down. It recently launched a US$20 billion fund to support Chinese independence in a range of manufacturing technologies to complement another US$20 billion fund to boost development in semiconductors. China\u00e2  s decision to consciously decouple from American technology, building separate domestic manufacturing capacity for components it previously imported and securing its own supply chains only reinforces tech\u00e2  s balkanisation, which in turn could lead to derating of global tech giants. China\u00e2  s tech ecosystem would look like a beautiful bonsai to investors, confined mostly within its borders. The Alibabas and Tencents of the world will be derated, as will many American tech firms that can sell almost everywhere except in the world\u00e2  s second-largest market.</p><p>The rise and rise of surveillance</p><p>Like it or not, you are being watched and all sorts of data about you is being gathered through your smartphone, watch, tablet, desktop browsing, car, shopping habits, travels, financial transactions as well as visits to the doctor, restaurants and theatres. Every time you walk into a mall, office building, train station, airport, school or hospital, or walk on a pavement downtown, your image is being recorded. Soon you would be able to board a plane or train or watch a movie in a cinema or a soccer match in a stadium without a physical ticket because cameras will recognise that you have already paid for your ticket since your image, itinerary and payment data is already stored somewhere in the cloud.</p><p>Shops would have your entire credit history and whether you can afford the product you are browsing; they will treat you differently from another less-credit-worthy customer. It is spooky and it will get worse even in some of the most liberal countries that pride themselves in protecting privacy. The debate around surveillance and privacy will only get louder over the next 10 years but we are too far along in the surveillance economy to turn back.</p><p>In the final years of the just-ended decade, among the big tech themes were artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, digital payments, blockchain and the cloud-based subscription economy, particularly within the software and services space, though it has been spreading to hardware. Ten years from now, few of us will still have our own smartphones or cars. We will just take out a subscription to a car or phone service that gives us access to the hardware. We are likely to see more traction on AI and digital payments in the new decade but do not bet against incumbents such as the big banks. JP Morgan, which pooh-poohed bitcoin two years ago, is working on its own stable coin, JPM Coin.</p><p>At end-2019, there were over 410 unicorns worldwide. New crops of unicorns will come not just from firms in blockchain, AI or payments but also from firms in 5G-enabled Internet of Things such as driverless cars and remote robotic surgery. Emerging unicorns might also include pioneers in quantum computing, which use supercomputers equipped with advanced processing powers as well as edge computing, which enables connected devices like driverless cars to process data closer to where it is created \u00e2 \" or the \u00e2  edge\u00e2 . Essentially, edge computing will provide driverless cars with an alternative to sending data to a far-away remote server or a centralised \u00e2  cloud\u00e2  for processing. As edge computing gets traction, driverless cars will become a reality sooner than we expect.</p><p>The recent implosion of co-working unicorn WeWork will likely have far-reaching consequences for who gets funded and how long unicorns can stay private in the new decade. Valued at over US$49 billion by its venture capital investors, WeWork sought a listing in October at a valuation of between US$75 billion and US$100 billion. By the time investors read through its pre-IPO prospectus, or S1 filing, they were looking at a firm that was just weeks away from bankruptcy. It was bailed out by its largest investor, Japan\u00e2  s SoftBank Group, and is currently valued at just over US$7.5 billion.</p><p>The lesson we learnt from the WeWork saga is that public markets are far better in separating the wheat from the chaff than a handful of VCs in the private markets. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son became the world\u00e2  s richest person at the height of the 2000 tech boom by overpaying for tech start-ups. When the bubble burst, Son, whose net worth declined 95% in the aftermath, spent the next decade nursing his wounds until he struck gold with a US$20 million investment in Chinese e-commerce pioneer Alibaba Group Holding, which turned into US$120 billion, or a 6,000-fold gain. In the aftermath of the WeWork debacle, it might take Son more than just a decade to get his mojo back.</p><p>We are also likely to see a bigger push towards the democratisation of investing, or enabling more investors to partake in the next tech boom. That means free online stock trading for everyone, even if you are not selling your data to the brokerage in return. It also means trading in fractional shares so you can just invest US$100 in \u00c2\u00adAmazon.com without worrying about the fact that you have to fork out US$1,880 for just one share. Regulators should not prevent you from buying what you want or when you want. Another trend that will catch on in the new decade is direct listings. More firms such as Spotify, Slack and Airbnb will choose to list directly instead of taking the traditional IPO route. A direct listing is not just a cheaper IPO alternative and not just for firms that do not want to raise new money. It can also be used by firms that are raising money as part of the listing process.</p><p>After the nightmare of the just-ended decade, tech desperately wants to get its act together and deliver on its promise \u00e2 \" not just as an agent of change and disruption but also as a force for good.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGEMA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGEMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXY-51P1-DYX1-V1XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Communications Sdn.

We established a subsidiary in Kuala Lumpur in end-January to help promote and market our solution in this part of the world,\u00e2  he tells The Edge in an interview.</p><p>The ATA.ONE app is currently only available in Europe and the Middle East. The company has four airline customers to date \u00e2 \" Croatia Airlines, Montenegro Airlines, Iberia and Azerbaijan Airlines \u00e2 \" and the app is connected to their inventory (unfilled seats).</p><p>\u00e2  We have approached 50 other airlines such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines and Brunei Airlines to come onboard our air ticket distribution platform. It does not matter if they are low-cost or full-service carriers,\u00e2  Budinski says.</p><p>About 2.2 million seats are left unsold every day around the world, he points out. \u00e2  For airlines, empty seats mean lost revenue. With ATA.ONE, we can help them sell all their unsold or distressed inventory.\u00e2 </p><p>The main concern among airlines, he notes, is that ATA.ONE\u00e2  s solution might cannibalise their current sales.</p><p>\u00e2  The solution is, in fact, attracting new customers that they never have had before. The airlines also determine the minimum price they are willing to accept for the unsold seats, as well as the number of seats and flights they would like to offer on our distribution platform, so there will be no cannibalisation,\u00e2  he explains.</p><p>The solution also offers airlines the ability to block any of their passengers from accessing the online platform. \u00e2  The bidding rules are fully controlled by the airlines,\u00e2  says Budinski.</p><p>The platform is a \u00e2  low-risk, free solution\u00e2  for airlines as it is fully automated, he asserts. \u00e2  The seats are only sold at prices that are within the airline\u00e2  s acceptable profit margins, and there is no cost to airlines or passengers until a match occurs and e-tickets are issued.\u00e2 </p><p>To use the ATA.ONE distribution platform, airlines first determine the minimum price they are willing to accept for seats that remain unsold 24 or 48 hours prior to a flight\u00e2  s departure.</p><p>As for passengers, they just have to download the ATA.ONE app on their mobile phones and register, says Budinski.</p><p>\u00e2  Once they have completed the registration process, they can search for the desired destination, airline, travel dates and budget. Upon entering all the information, they just need to place a bid. If it is a winning bid, payment is done automatically and the booking code is received directly from the airline, 24 to 48 hours prior to the planned departure.</p><p>\u00e2  This booking code will be used for web check-in. However, the booking code does not guarantee passengers a seat on the flight they bought because it is still up to the airline. That can happen even if they buy a [physical] ticket. The thing is, not everybody turns up for every flight,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>According to him, fares purchased via ATA.ONE app can be 40% to 60% cheaper than a regular airline ticket. Each time a seat is sold through an ATA.ONE bid, the passenger pays a small commission to the company.</p><p>ATA.ONE expects to break even by June. \u00e2  We need to sell about 300 seats per day to break even. We did 2,000 successful bids in October to December last year,\u00e2  says Budinski, who has more than 25 years of experience in the aviation industry and business in general.</p><p>He founded the company with four others \u00e2 \" Sandra Mikuli, Ivan Janovi, Sasa Pavolovi and Jiri Marek. Budinski is the largest shareholder with a 76% stake with the remaining 24% equity interest split among 30 investors from 13 countries, including the four co-founders.</p><p>He says ATA.ONE was established in 2015 with \u00c2\u00a350,000 in funds. It started with an idea to create a tool that would help airlines to sell unsold seats through a bidding process at the last minute.</p><p>\u00e2  We spoke to a couple of airlines and all were positive about the idea. During the first two years, we spent time travelling around Europe, the Middle East and East Asia, visiting airlines and explaining our business idea without any product. That was the toughest part of this business \u00e2 \" to convince the airlines\u00e2   revenue managers that the ATA.ONE solution would not cannibalise their existing sales channel,\u00e2  Budinski says.</p><p>Between November 2017 and February 2018, the company developed a proof of concept to test its idea, during which it attracted 80,000 website visits and 10,000 registered users to its bidding platform.</p><p>\u00e2  That was another sign [for us] to continue the solution to full development, which was completed in August 2018. At the time, we had already secured Croatia Airlines, Montenegro Airlines, Iberia and Azerbaijan Airlines as our trial airline customers,\u00e2  says Budinski, a Croatian.</p><p>The platform saw interest from airlines in Southeast Asia last December.</p><p>The company is looking to raise \u00c2\u00a35 million to \u00c2\u00a310 million from new investors in the third quarter of the year to expand its reach globally.</p><p>Budinski says he is willing to pare down his stake in ATA.ONE to 51%.</p><p>\u00e2  In 2020, we intend to expand our platform to cover North and South America. We are leaving that to the last even though it is a major market as there are a lot more regulations there,\u00e2  he adds.</p><p>In the long term, he is looking at an initial public offering in 2021 as an exit strategy or to sell the business to a larger tech rival. \u00e2  There are three big tech companies in the world which are monitoring our development,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>Based on a third-party valuation carried out recently, the company is worth \u00c2\u00a314 million, he adds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGEMA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGEMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W47-G6S1-JCF0-400F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Edge Communications Sdn.

Global investors helped drive Chinese tech stocks 70% higher last year, with shares of the two internet giants, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, more than doubling as they chased high-growth tech plays. More recently, though, investors have been less enamoured with the duo as well as\u00c2\u00a0Baidu,\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00adJD.com\u00c2\u00a0and other Chinese tech stocks. From their peak in late January to the trough earlier this month, large Chinese tech stocks were down nearly 15%, with \u00c2\u00adAlibaba 19% lower. Although they rebounded recently, most are way below their January peak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what has changed? Is it just the sentiment towards Chinese stocks in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump\u00e2  s tough talk on trade and tariffs as well as his vow to clamp down on intellectual property violations by Chinese companies? Or are fundamentals, such as margin pressures and a slower pace of earnings growth from the robust levels of last year, a factor? \u00e2  It is only natural that there was some profit-\u00c2\u00adtaking given how well Chinese internet stocks have performed over the past two years,\u00e2  \u00c2\u00adOliver Cox, portfolio manager for JPMorgan \u00c2\u00adAsset Management in Hong Kong, who runs the firm\u00e2  s Pacific Technology Fund, tells\u00c2\u00a0The Edge Singapore\u00c2\u00a0in a recent interview.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>China tech stocks are not alone in feeling suddenly unloved by global investors. Trump\u00e2  s tweets about e-commerce giant Amazon.com, the sight of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg being forced to testify before the US Congress and Washington\u00e2  s attempt to regulate search giant Google\u00e2  s parent Alphabet have all weighed on the global tech sector. Yet, while an aggressive pushback against the erosion of privacy as well as monetisation of data in the aftermath of recent Facebook revelations has impacted US tech giants, Chinese internet firms are continuing to grow at a much faster pace than their US peers and are also able to harness the data more powerfully.</p><p>To be sure, although US internet giants and their Chinese counterparts may share similar business models, their medium- to longer-term outlooks could not be more different. In many ways, Alibaba and Tencent have an advantage over their developed-market peers. For one thing, China\u00e2  s population is more ready to embrace new technology without fretting about privacy. Moreover, the country\u00e2  s regulatory environment is not only benign, but Beijing has been a big cheerleader for its home-grown cham\u00c2\u00adpions whom it is keen to nurture as global tech leaders. In addition to Alibaba and its ilk being able to collect more data more freely, as China catches up in artificial intelligence and eventually takes the lead, their ability to monetise whatever they collect, including data on their customers\u00e2   health and finances, makes them more formidable players in e-commerce, search, gaming, financial technology and robotics.</p><p>Chinese internet players have long lived in the shadow of global giants such as \u00c2\u00adAmazon, Google and social network operator Facebook. \u00e2  Investors have consistently underestimated growth in consumer demand as well as in e-commerce or online retailing or gaming or even search advertising in China, which have all ended up growing far faster than what the market anticipated,\u00e2  says Cox. They have also underestimated the Chinese giants\u00e2   ability to chart their own course to the top. Tencent and Alibaba are ranked among the top six tech companies in the world by market value.</p><p>Eighty-five per cent of people in China still buy from physical stores. Having cornered 15% of the total market, Alibaba and Tencent are now going aggressively after offline bricks-and-mortar retail. Over the past two years, they have spent about US$20 billion (RM77.7 billion) buying offline retailers as they seek to extend their control of O2O, or online-to-offline, \u00c2\u00adretailing by pulling in shoppers who buy online from retailers with a physical presence. More often than not, Chinese consumers are using Alipay or Tenpay to pay for their online or offline purchases. Aside from digital payments, Alibaba and Tencent are pouring money into logistics and delivery as well as mobile digital payments. These investments complement their core franchises, Cox says.</p><p>Still bleeding on payments</p><p>One area that has long been touted as a key driver for China tech plays is payments. China has leapfrogged into a cashless society. Most people pay for coffee, food, indeed even roadside chestnuts, by scanning QR codes on their smartphones. iResearch expects digital payments in China to grow 66% this year. Both Ali\u00c2\u00adbaba\u00e2  s 33%-owned affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent\u00e2  s 30%-owned financial arm WeBank were expected to list later this year but analysts say those IPOs have now been pushed to next year. Ant and its mobile and online payment system \u00c2\u00adAlipay now boast a little more than half of China\u00e2  s US$17 trillion payments market with Tencent\u00e2  s affiliates having a big chunk of the rest.</p><p>As a private company, Ant does not publish financial data, but analysts covering Alibaba have tried to figure out its revenues and profits. Gregory Zhao, China internet analyst for Barclays in New York, estimates that payments accounted for 55% of Ant\u00e2  s US$8.9 billion in revenues last year. He expects payments\u00e2   share of Ant\u00e2  s total revenues will decline to around 33% within three years as it grows its wealth management and lending businesses. Karen Chan, internet analyst for Jefferies &amp; Co, estimates Ant had operating profits of US$2.1 billion last year. Payments and fintech are a huge opportunity for Alibaba and Tencent, argues JPMorgan\u00e2  s Cox. \u00e2  Given that \u00c2\u00adAlibaba and Tencent have a huge existing user base of people transacting on their platforms, it is only natural that they want to expand the usage,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>The way Cox sees it, Ant \u00e2  may look like a payment business today, but if you fast forward five to 10 years, you might be looking at Ant as China\u00e2  s most prominent financial group. The business model has already expanded beyond mere payments to include credit cards, other lending, banking services, wealth management, savings, pensions and insurance\u00e2 .</p><p>Ant is reportedly raising US$9 billion from Chinese and global investors, including Singapore\u00e2  s Temasek Holdings, valuing it at over US$150 billion, or almost as much as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo combined. At that valuation, Alibaba\u00e2  s financial arm would be the sixth largest financial institution in the country, just behind Bank of China. Ant is indeed huge; its RMB1.6 trillion ($333.7 billion) Yu\u00e2  E Bao money market fund makes up nearly a quarter of China\u00e2  s total money market assets.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Bhavtosh Vajpayee, analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong, expects Ant to lose money this year and probably next year as it tries to take market share from Tencent\u00e2  s financial affiliates. In recent months, regulators in Beijing have cracked down on high interest rate payday loans, peer-to-peer lending, money market funds and cross-border foreign exchange payments. For its part, Ant has put a 24% interest rate ceiling on consumer loans and caps on money market fund investments. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma has promised that Ant will be \u00e2  socially responsible\u00e2  as it expands its services. Ear\u00c2\u00adlier this year, the People\u00e2  s Bank of China decreed that Ant and WeChat Pay should place 42% of their total assets into non-interest-bearing PBOC accounts, from 12% previously. Not being able to put this much-bigger chunk of money to use will cut into Ant\u00e2  s profitability, says Vajpayee. He notes that Alibaba and Tencent are involved in a fierce subsidy war that could cost between US$2 billion and US$4 billion over the next year. Alibaba is spending billions on merchant subsidies in order to make up for its smaller share in offline payments, he adds.</p><p>Cox does not see cut-throat competition and PBOC\u00e2  s decision to force them to set a bigger slice aside as a big negative. As Ant and \u00c2\u00adWeBank expand, they are bound to come under the regulatory purvey of the central bank, he says. \u00e2  They still have a huge user base, they have all the data, they know how to monetise it, they understand how to make online businesses work in what will be, over the next few years, the world\u00e2  s largest economy.\u00e2 </p><p>The JPMorgan portfolio manager argues that the internet giants\u00e2   huge investments in payments as well as growing investments in logistics and offline retail expansion for \u00c2\u00adAlibaba, and gaming and video for Tencent should be seen as moves to build stronger foundations for future growth. He concedes that over the next year or two, their margins are likely to be compressed as they continue to make new investments across a whole range of businesses, but argues that they will remain extremely profitable. \u00e2  What that means is, in the short run, costs will go up and as such, we might have slightly slower earnings growth,\u00e2  says Cox. He argues, however, that this is what fast-growing businesses such as Alibaba or \u00c2\u00adTencent should be doing: \u00e2  Securing the moat, expanding the network, strengthening the franchise and the entire ecosystem to build a platform for higher long-term growth.\u00e2 \u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Whether it is buying offline retail companies or building a large global, fintech business that includes not just payments but also online banking, wealth management and insurance, the investments being made by Alibaba and Tencent are strategically very sound and significant and expected to reap substantial returns over time, says Cox. \u00e2  Investors are looking beyond one-year or 18-month margin pressures because these investments will lead to much higher margins over the long term and help expand the overall franchise and business of these companies.\u00e2 </p><p>Alibaba\u00e2  s Ant and Tencent\u00e2  s WeChat Pay and Tenpay have also been expanding their financial services businesses overseas. Tencent has identified Indonesia and Malaysia as markets where it will expand its e-payment services. Ant and Alibaba are shareholders in Paytm, India\u00e2  s largest digital payment firm. Last month, Ant paid US$184.5 million for a 45% stake in Telenor Microfinance Bank, a subsidiary of Norway\u00e2  s \u00c2\u00adTelenor that operates a mobile app for financial services in Pakistan. But Ant and Tencent still have no presence in the world\u00e2  s biggest economy, the US. In January, Alibaba was forced to scrap its US$1.2 billion acquisition of US money transfer firm MoneyGram International after the Trump administration objected to the deal.</p><p>CDRs or home listings</p><p>As they spend to grow their franchise, one key driver over the next year for giants such as \u00c2\u00adAlibaba, Baidu and\u00c2\u00a0JD.com\u00c2\u00a0that are listed in the US, and Tencent which trades on the Hong Kong bourse, is likely to be mainland listings. Beijing wants these companies to list locally so that Chinese retail investors as well as institutions can partake in their lucrative growth. Alibaba, Tencent and others are reportedly exploring Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs), although most analysts do not expect mainland tech listings this year.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>One big positive of CDRs is that they will help expand the companies\u00e2   investor base among their core users in mainland China. Detractors say existing shareholdings may be diluted if CDRs involve the issue of new shares. \u00e2  If it involves the issuance of additional shares, it could be dilutive, but that won\u00e2  t stop \u00c2\u00adAlibaba doing a share buyback and reducing share count,\u00e2  argues Cox, who notes that the tech behemoths do not need to raise money from the A-shares market. \u00e2  They have been self-funding for a number of years.\u00e2  Moreover, the listing of Ant Financial and WeBank and other affiliates as well as subsidiaries over the next few years will keep their coffers overflowing.</p><p>After years of heady 40% to 60% annual earnings growth, Tencent and Alibaba are headed towards 20% to 25% growth this year and next, notes Bernstein\u00e2  s Vajpayee. That still makes them among the fastest-growing large tech companies in the world. They are also seen as a \u00e2  safe haven\u00e2  of sorts for investors who are worried about rising protectionism, the spectre of a US-China trade war and punitive tariffs because most of their business is domestic and they are not under the threat of being punished for \u00e2  stealing\u00e2  intellectual property as Washington pushes to rebalance trade flows between US and China. Long after the brouhaha of a trade war is over, China\u00e2  s internet giants will still be collecting, harnessing and monetising their customers\u00e2   data and boosting their bottom lines.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGEMA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGEMA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S63-MPN1-DYX1-V0RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Edge Communications Sdn.

The\u00c2\u00a0congressional\u00c2\u00a0hearing,\u00c2\u00a0part of\u00c2\u00a0a wide-ranging antitrust probe of the tech players that have a combined market capitalisation of US$3.3 trillion \u00c2\u00ad(S$4.49 trillion), will cover their potential threat to competition and innovation as well as whether their continued dominance is harmful to consumers or business rivals.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The moment of truth for global tech \u00c2\u00adgiants\u00c2\u00a0is finally here.\u00c2\u00a0A decade\u00c2\u00a0after the end of the global financial crisis that suddenly catapulted high-growth tech companies with their blitzscaling business models to the forefront as the new drivers of the global economy, US regulators are\u00c2\u00a0cracking\u00c2\u00a0the whip. Will search giant Google, social media powerhouse Facebook and e-commerce pioneer Amazon be reined in? Will the intense scrutiny of their respective business models eventually lead to antitrust action against one or several of them? Will they be regulated?\u00c2\u00a0Are\u00c2\u00a0Facebook and Google\u00c2\u00a0in danger of being\u00c2\u00a0broken up?\u00c2\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Silicon Valley behemoths are in the crosshairs of global regulators not because they are among the largest and most profitable businesses on earth, but because they exploit the data we produce as part of the normal course of web browsing, app use and digital consumption as well as making sophisticated inferences about who we are, what we want and what we are likely to do.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Harvard\u00c2\u00a0professor\u00c2\u00a0Shoshana Zuboff, the author of a\u00c2\u00a0new book on\u00c2\u00a0the business model of data harvesting,\u00c2\u00a0The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u00c2\u00a0argues that\u00c2\u00a0Google and Facebook are primarily focused on gathering data about everybody and using it to manipulate choices available to people and getting them to do things or modify behaviour, shaping it towards desired commercial outcomes\u00c2\u00a0like generating advertising revenues or e-commerce sales.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Indeed,\u00c2\u00a0digital platforms\u00c2\u00a0such as Google and Facebook are today where the US chemical industry was in the 1950s when they were pouring by-products like mercury and chromium into fresh water, says San Francisco-based veteran venture capitalist Roger \u00c2\u00adMcNamee, the author of\u00c2\u00a0Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u00e2  What we are seeing is the digital equivalent of a toxic oil spill where tech companies, like Facebook and Google, are not bearing the huge cost of the damage they are doing to society,\u00e2  he says.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Under scrutiny\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Tech giants have been under scrutiny since late 2016 when Facebook was accused of allowing the Russians to manipulate the US presidential elections that put Donald Trump in the White House. Since then, both major parties in America, the Republicans and Democrats, have attacked the tech giants for their political bias, privacy violations, as well as for their business model of extracting too much data without permission and then selling and reselling it for profits.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>US regulators, Congressmen and President Trump have stepped up their attacks on data harvesters in recent months. The ascension of William Barr, a known critic of Big Tech, as the US Attorney General in mid-February was the tipping point in the case against the internet giants. \u00e2  A lot of people wonder how huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,\u00e2  Barr told his Senate confirmation hearings earlier this year.\u00c2\u00a0Late last month, Trump in a TV interview said that the government \u00e2  should be \u00c2\u00adsuing Google and Facebook, which perhaps we will\u00e2 . The president also has a long-running feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns\u00c2\u00a0The Washington Post, a constant critic of his administration.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Antitrust investigations into large, powerful companies are nothing new. In 1984, US regulators broke up giant telco AT&amp;T into small regional \u00e2  baby bell\u00e2  phone companies, which eventually helped \u00c2\u00adusher in a telecommunications revolution. Computer giant\u00c2\u00a0IBM\u00c2\u00a0survived a \u00c2\u00ad13-year antitrust scrutiny between 1969 and 1982.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00adMicrosoft, which was the dominant player in the personal computer era, barely scraped through after an extensive investigation that began 1998. In April 2000, the Department of Justice (DOJ) ruled that the software giant be broken up, and even though that ruling was later reversed, Microsoft was distracted enough by the scrutiny to miss the internet revolution as well as the switch to mobile communications, clearing the way for the emergence of players such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, and re-emergence of Apple.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>In late June, DOJ finally launched an official inquiry into Google. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating both Facebook and Amazon while DOJ is investigating Apple. FTC has been reportedly working with Facebook for months on a deal that could result in a US$5 billion fine. FTC is likely to take other regulatory actions resulting from the violations of the 2011 consent decree that prohibited Facebook from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network promised FTC that it would get the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences. FTC is also investigating reports that Facebook\u00e2  s founder Mark Zuckerberg was aware that his company was in violation of the FTC decree as far back as 2012 and did nothing about it.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>To be sure, regulators are moving quickly because the US is in the early stages of a political cycle that will end with fiercely fought presidential elections next November. That aside, there is also a growing awareness that the world\u00e2  s biggest tech firms have issues that are bad for the US, global economy and emerging competitors, as well as consumers around the world.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Very different cases\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Yet each of the cases against the four tech giants could not be more different. Tech industry analysts say the case against Apple, which does not extract personal data without permission or sell data to advertisers, appears trivial. Apple has been criticised for its App Store. Though the company has a mere 17% share of global smartphone market, its App Store accounts for over two-thirds of the total app revenues worldwide.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Music streaming giant\u00c2\u00a0Spotify\u00c2\u00a0recently lodged a formal complaint with the Euro\u00c2\u00adpean Union claiming that Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favour of its own Apple Music service. Apple denies the charges and competition lawyers say the problem can been rectified fairly easily by changing the way Apple charges developers who sell their apps on its App Store. Both Apple and its rival Google Play store take a 30% cut from developers or a smaller 15% for in-app purchases. Amazon has some serious structural issues, like its ability to develop competing white-label products at the expense of its brand\u00c2\u00a0suppliers\u00c2\u00a0and then pushing them at its customers with all the data at its disposal. But Amazon, which despite\u00c2\u00a0its dominance in e-commerce\u00c2\u00a0has less than 10% of the US retail market,\u00c2\u00a0is seen likely to survive any antitrust scrutiny.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>For Google and Facebook, the issues go to the heart of their business\u00c2\u00a0model. \u00e2  Facebook\u00e2  s acquisition of Instagram was the greatest regulatory failure of the past decade,\u00e2  says Taipei-based tech strategist Ben Thompson, who writes the popular\u00c2\u00a0Stratechery\u00c2\u00a0blog. Regulators doubled down on the mistake by later allowing Facebook to buy WhatsApp. Yet that\u00c2\u00a0does not mean the antitrust scrutiny will lead to severe action like Facebook being forced to divest or hive off Instagram or WhatsApp, a breakup of Google or being put under regulations that basically tie their hands. Still, in Google\u00e2  s case particularly, it is more likely than not that DOJ will force some changes to the business model.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Facebook\u00e2  s COO Sheryl Sandberg has been appealing to America\u00e2  s worst nationalist instincts by arguing that instead of being obsessed with the size and power of the Silicon Valley giants, people should be\u00c2\u00a0concerned about the Chinese tech giants that are being nurtured by Beijing and allowed to grow without any obstacles.\u00c2\u00a0America\u00e2  s attempts to\u00c2\u00a0rein in Facebook and Google are putting its tech leaders at a severe disadvantage in key technologies like artificial intelligence, where it needs to be ahead, against the likes of China\u00e2  s home-grown tech champions like\u00c2\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding,\u00c2\u00a0Tencent Holdings\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Baidu.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren,\u00c2\u00a0a left-leaning Democrat and leading contender for a presidential nomination next year,\u00c2\u00a0has emerged as the icon of the Big Tech breakup.\u00c2\u00a0She argues that the tech giants are a clear\u00c2\u00a0danger to American democracy, as well as to competition, because there is a massive gathering of data without permission, which is then used in a way that consumers are completely unaware of. \u00e2  Not only do companies like Facebook and Google extract private data without permission, they pay very little taxes, if any,\u00e2 \u00c2\u00a0says Warren, who has been particularly harsh on Amazon and has argued that Apple should be forced to hive off its App Store.</p><p>Warren and several other Democratic presidential contenders argue that if Washington breaks up the Big Tech companies, there will be more competition and more innovation, which in turn will only help grow the US economy faster. Silicon Valley\u00e2  s entrepreneurial world has been completely upended as Facebook, Google and Amazon have grown into giant incumbents. Every start-up these days has to have a plan to avoid</p><p>competing with these giant incumbents because they would be clobbered if they do,\u00c2\u00a0the way Facebook started copying everything that</p><p>Snapchat did.\u00c2\u00a0Indeed, the fear of the tech giants\u00c2\u00a0is starting to stifle \u00c2\u00adinnovation. The upshot of that is that start-ups these days are trying riskier business models that tend to be capital-\u00c2\u00adintensive, lower-return businesses and venture capitalists are being forced to take bigger risks or walk away.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>When American regulators finally do get around to forcing Google, Facebook and others to pay for the cost of the damage they have wreaked over the past decade, they will be a lot less profitable.\u00c2\u00a0Yet\u00c2\u00a0that will not make\u00c2\u00a0Facebook or Google\u00c2\u00a0unattractive businesses \u00e2 \" just more responsible players in the society.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGEMA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGEMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-67R1-JCF0-4188-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Edge Communications Sdn.

Macro worries included the US-China trade war and Brexit. Twelve months on, neither is resolved positively. Chinese economic growth has since fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. German business confidence has descended into\u00a0 deep gloom. But despite all of this there has been some cheer and plenty of action in the business world in 2019.\u00a0</p><p>Public display of affection?</p><p>Public market investors have complained for years that stock markets are being hollowed out in a spate of mergers, take-privates and stubborn unicorns. Much of that trend continued in 2019. The UK, for example, saw a series of privatisations, of Legoland-owner\u00a0 Merlin Entertainments, defence contractor\u00a0 Cobham and satellite company\u00a0 Inmarsat. But we did finally see some replenishment. Lyft and Uber floated, with the two ride-hailing companies vying for public investors instead of passengers. It has not gone brilliantly, however: their stocks are both down by a third. Slack, the office messaging company, has fallen 45 per cent.</p><p>But at least they got away</p><p>It took months of delays for Saudi Aramco to list and achieve the $2tn valuation sought by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But does it\u00a0 really count? The state-owned oil company had to give up on a foreign listing and stick to Riyadh, where it lent heavily on local investors. Many international institutions balked at a combination of valuation and governance concerns. Only a sliver of the company is freely traded.</p><p>We didn\u2019t work</p><p>The kingdom suffered an indirect blow from another \u2014 far more spectacular \u2014 botched IPO this year. WeWork\u2019s flotation was the biggest test yet for its main backer, the $100bn SoftBank Vision Fund, whose biggest investor is Saudi Arabia. A lot of people said WeWork was an overvalued property group, whose business model of taking long-term leases, sprucing them up and reletting them on a short-term basis was flawed. But not many people predicted the IPO itself would fail. Investors had no interest in buying in at SoftBank\u2019s $47bn valuation but nor did investment bankers elicit sufficient interest at $20bn or less. In the end, the IPO was not possible and founder Adam Neumann departed the company. SoftBank slashed the valuation to $5bn.</p><p>The tail that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.</p><p>SoftBank is persevering. It abandoned Wag, its dog-walking start-up, but increased its bet on Oyo, its Indian hotels business. Meanwhile, it is trying to raise money for a second big tech fund and hoping that chief executive Masayoshi Son can pick just one knockout winner \u2014 as he did so successfully with Alibaba \u2014 to redeem the grand project.</p><p>Positive outlook</p><p>As some of the unicorns struggled in the public glare, other old stagers of the tech sector shone. Apple\u00a0 added $400bn in market capitalisation despite an unremarkable year for hardware releases. Microsoft briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable public company and now has almost $1.2tn in equity value, a remarkable feat 20 years after its previous era of dominance. The company that milked its monopoly in the 1990s has managed to evolve under chief executive Satya Nadella as computing has shifted to the cloud.</p><p>House of Wirecard</p><p>Europe is hardly awash with tech champions but Germany has been able to boast a rising star. However, Wirecard, the financial technology group that climbed into the Dax 30, has had a tough year. The\u00a0 Singapore police raided its offices after an FT investigation into its accounting. Meanwhile, Wirecard critics were placed under surveillance by the former head of Libyan intelligence.</p><p>Spy drama in Zurich</p><p>In another corporate spying case, Credit Suisse hired private investigators to follow\u00a0 Iqbal Khan, its head of private banking. The tailing ended in a public confrontation in central Zurich. Police were called. And the fallout threatened chief executive Tidjane Thiam. In the end, Mr Khan moved to a senior role at UBS.</p><p>Is he worth that much?</p><p>Moving from a senior role at UBS was Andrea Orcel, who was unveiled in 2018 as the new chief executive of Santander. Yet in January this year the bank changed its mind, balking at a \u20ac50m signing-on bonus that was meant to cover the cost of unvested stock Mr Orcel lost on leaving UBS. Legal action continues.</p><p>US banks beat the Europeans</p><p>Elsewhere in banking, the transatlantic divide that has defined much of the past decade continued. Deutsche Bank announced more job cuts and HSBC\u2019s interim chief Noel Quinn ignored the impermanent nature of his title as he launched a sweeping restructuring. In the US, though, the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America posted more record profits as the US economy kept humming. Goldman Sachs agonised on how to return to the glory days: should it go bigger into consumer banking or build the next Blackstone? We should find out more at the long-awaited\u00a0 investor day in January.</p><p>Fair exchange?</p><p>The FT revealed in July that the London Stock Exchange was in talks to buy Refinitiv, the data group carved out of Thomson Reuters last year. The all-share deal was confirmed at $27bn. But then in September came an attempted spoiler. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\u00a0 went public with a \u00a332bn bid to buy the LSE \u2014 on condition it dropped the Refinitiv deal. It was seen universally as audacious but also by many investors as far-fetched, not least because it would need regulatory sign-off in the UK just as protesters thronged the streets of Hong Kong complaining about Beijing violating the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement.</p><p>Car mergers</p><p>The global car industry is in trouble. China has slowed down. And the cost of investing in electrification is frightening. The only response seems to be consolidation. With last year\u2019s death of Sergio Marchionne and arrest of Carlos Ghosn, it has fallen to a new generation of automotive leaders to plot different combinations.</p><p>Tesla keeps motoring</p><p>Elon Musk had his day in court and\u00a0 won a defamation case. Tesla kept motoring, with the stock hitting new highs, despite an awkward presentation of a new truck in which a metal object was hurled at the unsmashable windows. It smashed them. Twice.</p><p>Shale skids</p><p>The shale revolution has been a huge factor in the US economy for the past decade, bringing a surge in oil and gas production. But glut caused big problems for shale producers this year and in December\u00a0 Chevron announced a $10bn writedown for assets in Appalachia.\u00a0</p><p>Streaming wars intensify</p><p>The streaming wars drew in more well-funded combatants as Disney and Apple launched online video services to take on Netflix. With its vast back catalogue and ownership of the Star Wars series, Disney\u2019s launch was seen as the more impressive. Yet Netflix suffered fewer customer defections than feared.</p><p>Boeing flails</p><p>A second Boeing 737 Max passenger jet crashed in March, with the loss of all 157 people on board. The manufacturer\u2019s anti-stall system was implicated, as it was in a 2018 crash in Indonesia. Faulty systems were redesigned but Boeing failed to respond decisively. The planes remain grounded and the investigations have uncovered worrying evidence about the construction and regulation of US aircraft.</p><p>Big Four cut down to size</p><p>It was another unhappy year for much of the accounting industry. A spirit of austerity meant that KPMG told hundreds of employees to hand back their work mobile phones. There is still a looming threat from a\u00a0 UK government review, which could force a split of audit and consulting at the largest accounting firms.</p><p>Big Pharma looks to biotechs</p><p>The biggest deal of the year (so far) came right at the start, with Bristol-Myers Squibb paying $93bn for Celgene. It was an example of big pharma raiding the labs of biotechs in search of the next generation of blockbusters. In a similar vein, Novartis agreed to buy The Medicines Company for $9.7bn last month.\u00a0</p><p>Arnault put a ring on it</p><p>The world\u2019s biggest luxury goods company shrugged off trade wars and gloom with double-digit sales growth. LVMH then did some shopping for itself \u2014 popping over to New York to buy Tiffany in a $16.6bn deal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Thank you for reading this year.

And as industries from airlines to telecommunications become more consolidated in part as a result of laissez-faire oversight by federal regulators, private litigation is sometimes the only defense against corporations exercising market power to enrich themselves, according to an analysis out Tuesday from the University of San Francisco School of Law and the American Antitrust Institute. </p><p>\"Our concern is that the reason we have these problems that we have today with rising concentration and wage inequality issues is because public enforcement has been very lax,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which published its commentary alongside a data-heavy report. \"So private enforcement has been taking up some of the slack.\" </p><p>Private antitrust lawsuits had recovered $19.3 billion in settlements between 2013 and 2018, the report found, with the largest amount of money awarded in 2018. A handful of blockbuster cases accounted for the total last year, including a $2.3 billion settlement negotiated with 15 of the world's largest banks for fixing prices on the foreign exchange market, which lowers returns for investors like pension funds. </p><p>The analysis comes amid heightened awareness of mega-mergers and the far-reaching power of big tech companies, fueling calls from politicians like Elizabeth Warren that they be broken up. Aside from a few high-profile cases like the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, the Trump administration's Department of Justice has taken a less-aggressive approach to mergers and antitrust enforcement. </p><p>It's not just the Trump administration, though. Public antitrust enforcement has been on the decline for decades now. The Justice Department filed an average of 43 civil cases per year in the 1970s --- that was down to an average of 13 between 2008 and 2017, according the Department's statistics. </p><p>Legal doctrine shifted in the 1980s, allowing more large mergers to survive scrutiny by the courts. Companies grew larger and more powerful, which economists have found to be at the root of rising markups across many industries.</p><p>It hasn't gotten any easier to bring private actions either, and the aggregate number filed in US District Courts has also sunk since the 1970s. A series of rulings have narrowed the types of victims who are entitled to sue and increased the amount of evidence that plaintiffs have to offer in their complaints in order to survive a motion to dismiss, which may have depressed the total number of cases filed over the years. </p><p>\"As markets get more concentrated, you should see a rise in cases, because there's more potential for illegal activity,\" said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for the Open Markets Institute, which favors stricter scrutiny of mergers. \"The Supreme Court has been very hostile to plaintiffs' class actions.\" </p><p>Unlike enforcement actions by public agencies, private actions can win triple damages, leading to those eye-popping settlements. But they rarely force companies to divest whole divisions, and never carry criminal penalties, which only government prosecutors can impose. </p><p>Greg Asciolla is an attorney with Labaton Sucharow, which has pursued cases against generic pharmaceutical companies and banks for inflating the prices of drugs and complex financial products. In a more niche case, Asciolla is suing GE for allegedly locking up the market for gas anesthesia machines used in hospitals. (GE declined to comment on pending litigation.) </p><p>Despite being as busy as ever, he doesn't think trial lawyers are acting as a deterrent for large companies, which tend to see even multi-million dollar settlements as just the cost of doing business. </p><p>\"I don't think that companies are going to get away with antitrust violations, because we and the Justice Department are extremely vigilant,\" Asciolla said. \"But do I think the conduct is going to stop? Unfortunately I see the same companies doing it over and over again --- they're recidivists. I think I'm going to have a job until they're carting me out of here dead. I just don't see it stopping.\"</p><p>That's why, he says, there's no substitute for robust public enforcement.</p><p>\"The company pays a huge fine and nobody goes to jail,\" Asciolla said. \"When more individuals see actual human beings going to jail, that might stop people from engaging in such conduct.\" </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

And as industries from airlines to telecommunications become more consolidated in part as a result of laissez-faire oversight by federal regulators, private litigation is sometimes the only defense against corporations exercising market power to enrich themselves, according to an analysis out Tuesday from the University of San Francisco School of Law and the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>\"Our concern is that the reason we have these problems that we have today with rising concentration and wage inequality issues is because public enforcement has been very lax,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which published its commentary alongside a data-heavy report. \"So private enforcement has been taking up some of the slack.\"</p><p>Private antitrust lawsuits had recovered $19.3 billion in settlements between 2013 and 2018, the report found, with the largest amount of money awarded in 2018. A handful of blockbuster cases accounted for the total last year, including a $2.3 billion settlement negotiated with 15 of the world's largest banks for fixing prices on the foreign exchange market, which lowers returns for investors like pension funds.</p><p>The analysis comes amid heightened awareness of mega-mergers and the far-reaching power of big tech companies, fueling calls from politicians like Elizabeth Warren that they be broken up. Aside from a few high-profile cases like the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, the Trump administration's Department of Justice has taken a less-aggressive approach to mergers and antitrust enforcement.</p><p>It's not just the Trump administration, though. Public antitrust enforcement has been on the decline for decades now. The Justice Department filed an average of 43 civil cases per year in the 1970s ? that was down to an average of 13 between 2008 and 2017, according the Department's statistics.</p><p>Legal doctrine shifted in the 1980s, allowing more large mergers to survive scrutiny by the courts. Companies grew larger and more powerful, which economists have found to be at the root of rising markups across many industries.</p><p>It hasn't gotten any easier to bring private actions either, and the aggregate number filed in US District Courts has also sunk since the 1970s. A series of rulings have narrowed the types of victims who are entitled to sue and increased the amount of evidence that plaintiffs have to offer in their complaints in order to survive a motion to dismiss, which may have depressed the total number of cases filed over the years.</p><p>\"As markets get more concentrated, you should see a rise in cases, because there's more potential for illegal activity,\" said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for the Open Markets Institute, which favors stricter scrutiny of mergers. \"The Supreme Court has been very hostile to plaintiffs' class actions.\"</p><p>Unlike enforcement actions by public agencies, private actions can win triple damages, leading to those eye-popping settlements. But they rarely force companies to divest whole divisions, and never carry criminal penalties, which only government prosecutors can impose.</p><p>Greg Asciolla is an attorney with Labaton Sucharow, which has pursued cases against generic pharmaceutical companies and banks for inflating the prices of drugs and complex financial products. In a more niche case, Asciolla is suing GE for allegedly locking up the market for gas anesthesia machines used in hospitals. (GE declined to comment on pending litigation.)</p><p>Despite being as busy as ever, he doesn't think trial lawyers are acting as a deterrent for large companies, which tend to see even multi-million dollar settlements as just the cost of doing business.</p><p>\"I don't think that companies are going to get away with antitrust violations, because we and the Justice Department are extremely vigilant,\" Asciolla said. \"But do I think the conduct is going to stop? Unfortunately I see the same companies doing it over and over again ? they're recidivists. I think I'm going to have a job until they're carting me out of here dead. I just don't see it stopping.\"</p><p>That's why, he says, there's no substitute for robust public enforcement.</p><p>\"The company pays a huge fine and nobody goes to jail,\" Asciolla said. \"When more individuals see actual human beings going to jail, that might stop people from engaging in such conduct.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190513antitrust-private-litigation1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W40-F9K1-DY60-M08K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><timeReceived>11:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 13, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>antitrust-private-litigation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Under the guise of getting rid of lies and protecting children, they're working with the Trump administration and top Republicans to undermine Americans' rights and give the government unprecedented control over online speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Special interests trying to influence federal laws and regulations are nothing new in Washington. Big banks and drug companies have been wildly successful at working the system to discourage competition and stay on top. Occasionally, however, Congress actually passes a law that protects the less powerful elements of our society, the insurgents and the disrupters. That's what it did in 1996 when it passed a law I co-authored called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>Section 230 was written to provide legal protection to online platforms so they could take down objectionable material without being dragged into court. It lets companies remove posts from white supremacists or trolls without being sued for bias or for limiting individuals' First Amendment rights. If a website wants to cater to the right wing, it can. If it wants to ban Trump supporters, it can do that, too. </p><p>Section 230 also says the person who creates content is the one responsible for it. So if President Trump libels an innocent person on Twitter, he can be sued. Without 230, social media couldn't exist. Sites such as Yelp would be sued to death. Start-ups such as Portland's AllGo, which collects user reviews about how restaurants serve plus-size customers, would never get off the ground. Movements such as Black Lives Matter or #MeToo, whose advocates post controversial accusations against powerful figures on social media, would have remained whispers, not megaphones for oppressed communities. </p><p>The fight is defined by an intensive lobbying effort by big legacy corporations such as Disney and IBM that are looking for an advantage against big tech companies such as Google and Facebook. Each side wants to rewrite the rules to cement its own dominance.</p><p>Some have argued that repealing Section 230 would punish Facebook and Google for their failures. That's simply not true. The biggest tech companies have enough lawyers and lobbyists to survive virtually any regulation Congress can concoct. It's the start-ups seeking to displace Big Tech that would be hammered by the constant threat of lawsuits. </p><p>Whenever laws are passed to put the government in control of speech, the people who get hurt are the least powerful in society.</p><p>That's what happened in 2018, when, in the wake of news stories about disturbing ads on a site called Backpage, Congress scaled back 230 with a law known as SESTA-FOSTA - a combination of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. At the time, I proposed a different approach, including hiring more prosecutors. And I warned that this bill would do little to stop sex trafficking or help true victims but would simply push sex work underground. </p><p>By all accounts that is exactly what has happened. Backpage was shut down before SESTA even went into effect. And sex workers have been driven to the dark Web or the streets, where sex trafficking has increased dramatically. The most vulnerable group bore the brunt of this law. </p><p>This is how speech regulation inevitably works in practice. If Congress somehow were to amend the First Amendment and ban hate speech from the Internet, I see no reason to believe President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr would use that authority to protect LGBTQ activists or female journalists or African American civil rights leaders.</p><p>Instead, I'm certain this administration would use power to regulate speech to punish its enemies and protect its allies. It would threaten Facebook or YouTube for taking down white supremacist content. It would label Black Lives Matter activists as purveyors of hate. </p><p>The Trump administration is working with Republican Senate leaders to advance legislation giving the attorney general power to set online speech guidelines along with the opportunity to access everything Americans do with their digital devices. </p><p>There are plenty of things Congress can do to hold Big Tech accountable. I'd start with passing a strong privacy law, such as my Mind Your Own Business Act, which includes tough enforcement provisions for tech executives, including the possibility of jail. And concerns about anti-competitive practices, including the Facebook-Instagram merger, deserve serious investigation from the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>I stand ready to work with anyone to hold the biggest corporations accountable, whether for dodging taxes, extorting Medicare or ripping off consumers. I draw the line at putting any politician in charge of what people can say or how they can say it, whether it's on the Internet or anywhere else. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-23bcd9484f8b11ea9b5ceac5b16dafaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y79-V4X1-DXKP-J3G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CY6C</classCode><className>YELP!

The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels.

Sure, they were making gobs of money, but they were also \u201cchanging the world\u201d for the better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even demonstrators against capitalism revered them; when Steve Jobs died in 2011, the protesters at Occupied Wall Street mourned his passing.</p><p> Increasingly, Americans no longer regard our tech oligarchs as modern folk heroes; today companies including Google, Apple and Facebook are suffering huge drops in their reputations among the public.</p><p> Social justice, for some</p><p> The tech oligarchs make a big show of their social \u201cwokeness.\u201d They play up on gender issues, despite a wicked record of sexual harassment at companies like Google and across the \u201cbro culture\u201d of the male-dominated valley.</p><p> Worse still are issues of class. The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

Sure, they were making gobs of money, but they were also \u201cchanging the world\u201d for the better.</p><p>Even demonstrators against capitalism revered them; when Steve Jobs died in 2011, the protesters at Occupied Wall Street mourned his passing.</p><p> Increasingly, Americans no longer regard our tech oligarchs as modern folk heroes; today companies including Google, Apple and Facebook are suffering huge drops in their reputations among the public.</p><p> Social justice, for some</p><p> The tech oligarchs make a big show of their social \u201cwokeness.\u201d They play up on gender issues, despite a wicked record of sexual harassment at companies like Google and across the \u201cbro culture\u201d of the male-dominated valley.</p><p> Worse still are issues of class. The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

Sure, they were making gobs of money, but they were also \u201cchanging the world\u201d for the better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even demonstrators against capitalism revered them; when Steve Jobs died in 2011, the protesters at Occupied Wall Street mourned his passing.</p><p> Increasingly, Americans no longer regard our tech oligarchs as modern folk heroes; today companies including Google, Apple and Facebook are suffering huge drops in their reputations among the public.</p><p> Social justice, for some</p><p> The tech oligarchs make a big show of their social \u201cwokeness.\u201d They play up on gender issues, despite a wicked record of sexual harassment at companies like Google and across the \u201cbro culture\u201d of the male-dominated valley.</p><p> Worse still are issues of class. The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

Sure, they were making gobs of money, but they were also \u201cchanging the world\u201d for the better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even demonstrators against capitalism revered them; when Steve Jobs died in 2011, the protesters at Occupied Wall Street mourned his passing.</p><p> Increasingly, Americans no longer regard our tech oligarchs as modern folk heroes; today companies including Google, Apple and Facebook are suffering huge drops in their reputations among the public.</p><p> Social justice, for some</p><p> The tech oligarchs make a big show of their social \u201cwokeness.\u201d They play up on gender issues, despite a wicked record of sexual harassment at companies like Google and across the \u201cbro culture\u201d of the male-dominated valley.</p><p> Worse still are issues of class. The Bay Area, as CityLab put it, has devolved into \u201ca region of segregated innovation\u201d where the rich wax, the middle class declines and the poor suffer increasingly unshakeable poverty. Over the past decades wages for African Americans and Latinos in Silicon Valley have fallen during the boom while much of the work, up to 40 percent, has gone to temporary immigrant workers, the modern-day equivalent of indentured servants.</p><p> Of course, the oligarchs rely on immigrants to work as low-wage janitors, dog walkers and restaurant workers essential to their high-amenity economy. Not surprisingly they have been among the fiercest critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This fits into their image, cultivated, for example, by Jeff Bezos mouthpiece The Washington Post, as principled defenders of democracy and human rights against the would-be dictator in the White House.</p><p> Yet these pronouncements obscure remarkable hypocrisy. Time, owned by oligarch Marc Benioff, rejected its own readers\u2019 poll, which favored making the Hong Kong protesters \u201cperson of the year,\u201d and instead gave the honor to Greta Thunberg. This will bolster the Salesforce.com founder\u2019s green bona fides but also protects the company\u2019s growing presence in China. It seems there\u2019s no conflict between advocating wokeness in America while supporting repression in China. If tech-rich Taiwan, which just voted strongly against pro-mainland candidates, ever thought it could look to Silicon Valley for support, they should look again.</p><p> Masters of surveillance</p><p> Kowtowing to Beijing has its advantages. Some of some of America\u2019s most dominant tech firms, including Apple, Google and IBM make money helping China\u2019s systematic use of digital technology to impose ever-greater control over its citizens. Aided by this collaboration, China\u2019s unrestrained surveillance state, openly hostile to free thought, is likely to become a prototype for developing countries.</p><p> These companies are also helping construct an American surveillance state here at home. Privacy violations have been commonplace for companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, often with little warning to the customers. In 2018, Amazon\u2019s in-home device Alexa was found to be eavesdropping on people\u2019s conversations. Google now seeks to access our most intimate medical details. Despite fervent denials, privacy per se ranks remains only a low priority, something firms resist as much as possible. As Google\u2019s former executive Chairman Eric Schmidt once told CNBC: \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place.\u201d</p><p> By assembling personal data and then selling it, our daily lives no longer belongs to us alone but are relentlessly commodified. This is, of course, the natural goal of all the major tech firms which, suggests Jaron Lanier, helping create an atmosphere that serves to foster \u201ccreepiness and inspire justified paranoias.\u201d As the leftist Guardian put it: \u201cIf ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.\u201d</p><p> What goes around ...</p><p> Despite an increasingly large lobbying and public relations effort, the oligarchs are in danger of squandering their once near universal political support. Some 70 percent of Americans, notes a recent Pew study, believe social media platforms \u201ccensor political views.\u201d In California, just over the past year, the percentage of voters thinking tech firms need to be more heavily regulated has been rising to over 70 percent in both the Bay Area and Southern California.</p><p> Progressive clothing no longer protects them from populist fire. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have spoken against the oligarchs\u2019 quasi-monopoly status as well as the poor treatment of low-end workers in Apple\u2019s Chinese sweatshops, something referenced by Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses here at home.</p><p> The yawning gap between the tech elite and the worker bees has helped foster growing socialist and union movements within these companies, and not just at warehouses.</p><p> Tech workers may be well paid, but they have no bargaining power, and their higher salaries are largely swallowed by high housing prices and taxes. They act increasingly as high-tech proletarians, anxious to throw down their own bosses by contributing most to populists like Sanders and Warren.</p><p> Given these pressures, the tech firms may just dig in their heels. After all, they are well on their way to buying most of the major publications in the country, and gaining control of the culture industries as well. Ultimately the oligarchs must hope that the masses do not defect to the rebel alliance before their rule becomes so entrenched it cannot be reasonably challenged.</p><p> Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

(1) The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York charged both Huawei--the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and second-largest smartphone vender (2)--and Meng with various crimes in what the Department of Justice characterized as \"a long-running scheme by Huawei, its CFO, and other employees to deceive numerous global financial institutions and the U.S. government regarding Huawei's business activities in Iran.\" (3)</p><p>Meng's detention and subsequent prosecution inflamed the already strained relationship between Huawei and the United States. Hostility between the two parties had grown in the preceding months, as federal prosecutors circled Huawei for potential violations of export and sanctions laws (4) and a trade war between China and the United States grew increasingly hostile. (5) On August 13, 2018, Congress stepped in and passed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (\"NDAA\"), which, among other things, banned executive agencies, federal government contractors, and federal loan and grant recipients from using any \"telecommunications equipment or services\" made by Huawei and four additional Chinese tech companies. (6) Congress enacted the \"Huawei ban\" amid longstanding suspicions that the company was spying on Americans at the behest of the Chinese government. (7) Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, asserting its independence from Beijing. (8) A few months after Meng's detention, Huawei filed suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, (9) challenging the NDAA's ban as an unconstitutional bill of attainder.\"' That court has yet to rule on Huawei's challenge.</p><p>The Constitution contains two Bill of Attainder Clauses, which together proscribe bills of attainder at the federal and state levels. (11) Because the Supreme Court has treated its precedents for each of the Clauses as controlling its analysis of the other, this Note refers to them together as \"the Bill of Attainder Clause\" or \"the Clause.\" (12) The Bill of Attainder Clause prohibits both Congress and state legislatures from singling out specified actors for punishment. (13) The text of the Clause, however, makes no mention of which actors its prohibition protects: \"No Bill of Attainder ... shall be passed\" (14); \"[n]o State shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder.\" (15) The Supreme Court has never determined whether the Bill of Attainder Clause extends to corporations. As for Huawei's pending case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has once previously assumed that the Clause covers corporations: \"Even assuming that the Bill of Attainder Clause applies to corporations,\" (16) the court wrote, before dropping into a footnote, \"[w]hich does seem likely.\" (17) The federal courts of appeals have repeatedly employed this assume-without-deciding approach in the limited number of corporate bill of attainder cases because the constitutional challenges in those cases almost always failed on the merits; (18) the issue ultimately had no bearing on the outcome of unsuccessful challenges.</p><p>The Second Circuit is the sole federal circuit to determine whether the Clause extends to corporations, finding that it does in Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. Pataki (\"ConEdison\"). (19) Despite addressing the issue directly, the court's analysis in ConEdison is misleading and ultimately incomplete. Altogether, the opinion fails to recognize a sound doctrinal basis for subsequent corporate bill of attainder challenges. (20) As courts continue to punt by assuming without deciding, (21) the ultimate question of the Bill of Attainder Clause's protection of corporations lingers without an authoritative answer. Not only will future meritorious challenges require such a determination, but a clear elucidation of the rationale for why the Clause does or does not cover corporations will also shape the ways in which courts understand the substance of corporate attainder challenges before them.</p><p>This Note offers the first extended argument that the Bill of Attainder Clause extends to corporations, seeking to situate the corporate constitutional right against bills of attainder within both the Clause's established understandings and general theories of corporate constitutional rights. Following the Court's practice, this Note considers corporations generally and does not make distinctions between the various corporate forms. (22) This Note proceeds in three parts. Part I examines the Bill of Attainder Clause at length, tracing the history from attainders in English common law through the drafting of the Clause at the Constitutional Convention and assessing the Supreme Court's bill of attainder precedent. Part II briefly explores corporate constitutional rights at large, surveying the major theories of corporate personhood and the Court's ad hoc approach to determining corporate constitutional rights. Part III evaluates the Second Circuit's defective analysis in ConEdison before demonstrating that the Bill of Attainder Clause, properly understood, extends to corporations under the leading theories of corporate personhood and a Clause-specific purposive analysis.</p><p>I. The Constitutional Prohibition on Bills of Attainder</p><p>Adopted without debate, (23) the constitutional prohibition on bills of attainder establishes a right against \"legislative acts ... that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial.\" (24) As Justice Black observed, \"[h]ostility of the Framers toward bills of attainder was so great that they took the unusual step of barring such legislative punishments by the States as well as the Federal Government.\" (25) English and colonial historical practices explain the Framers' revulsion to such laws, and case law reveals the ways in which American legislatures have also attempted to single out disfavored actors for punishment throughout the nation's existence.</p><p>A. English Common Law and Early American Practice</p><p>Although historical accounts differ regarding the precise date of the first bill of attainder, a consensus of scholars agree that the fifteenth century marked the onset of the practice. (26) In his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, Justice Story described bills of attainder as \"special acts of the legislature, as inflict capital punishments upon persons supposed to be guilty of high offences, such as treason and felony, without any conviction in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\" (27) Traditional bills of attainder also required the attainted individual to forfeit property, (28) extending beyond all personal and real property to the denial of inheritance both to and from the individual--a practice known as the corruption of blood. (29)</p><p>Similar in spirit though far less severe, bills of pains and penalties were \"legislative convictions which imposed punishments less than that of death.\" (30) Such punishments included \"imprisonment, banishment, and the punitive confiscation of property by the sovereign.\" (31) The practice died out over the next century and a half, with the eventual passage of the final bills of attainder in 1798 (32) and pains and penalties in 1820. (33)</p><p>By their very definition, traditional bills of attainder could not be imposed on corporations. William Blackstone expressly observed that a corporation was not \"capable of suffering a traitor's or felon's punishment, for it is not liable to corporal penalties, nor to attainder, forfeiture, or corruption of blood.\" (34) Parliament did pass punitive bills directed at municipalities structured as corporations, (35) but it is unclear if English commentators considered these acts to be true bills of pains and penalties. Blackstone commented briefly on the practice, noting that a corporation may \"itself be dissolved in several ways, which dissolution is the civil death of the corporation,\" (36) with one way being \"[b]y act of parliament, which is boundless in its operations.\" (37)</p><p>The legislatures of the fledgling United States also enacted comparable bills. In the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution, \"every state in the Union appears to have enacted bills of pains and penalties of greater or less severity.\" (38) Such bills were commonplace against remaining Loyalists, (39) enacted indiscriminately to address both small ills as well as \"cases involving danger to the commonwealth for which they were supposed to be reserved.\" (40)</p><p>B. Supreme Court Precedent</p><p>The Constitution's ratification breathed new significance into \"bill of attainder\" as an American legal term. The Supreme Court first considered the term's meaning in 1798 in Calder v. Bull. (41) There, in a seriatim opinion, Justice Chase wrote of \"the denomination of bills of attainder, or bills of pains and penalties; the first inflicting capital, and the other less, punishment.\" (42) Sometimes, these acts \"inflicted punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment; and in other cases, they inflicted greater punishment, than the law annexed to the offence.\" (43) Commentators have since debated whether Justice Chase was suggesting a constitutional distinction between the two types of bills. (44)</p><p>The Court next considered the Bill of Attainder Clause's meaning in 1810 in Fletcher v. Peck, (45) which featured an influential dictum about Article I, Section 10, which includes the Bill of Attainder Clause, Ex Post Facto Clause, and Contracts Clause, among others. (46) Chief Justice Marshall noted that \"the framers of the constitution viewed, with some apprehension, the violent acts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment.\" (47) In adopting the Constitution, \"the people of the United States ... manifested a determination to shield themselves and their property from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are exposed.\" (48) Chief Justice Marshall went on to assert that \"[t]he restrictions on the legislative power of the states are obviously founded in this sentiment,\" as he deemed Article I, Section 10 \"a bill of rights for the people of each state.\" (49) He concluded with a loose definition: \"A bill of attainder may affect the life of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both.\" (50) With this statement, Chief Justice Marshall espoused a clear view that for constitutional purposes, bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties.</p><p>1. The Confederate-Sympathizer Era: Developing Doctrine. The Court faced its first Bill of Attainder Clause challenges in 1866, when it decided The Test Oath Cases (51): Cummings v. Missouri (52) and Ex parte Garland. (53) In these cases, the Court struck down state oaths that imposed punitive measures on suspected Confederate sympathizers--in Cummings, forbidding them from serving as priests, (54) and in Garland, forbidding them from practicing law. (55)</p><p>In Cummings, the Court unequivocally reaffirmed Chief Justice Marshall's understanding of bills of attainder from Fletcher: \"Within the meaning of the Constitution, bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties.\" (56) The challenged Missouri constitutional amendment imposed a wide-ranging oath of allegiance on public officials, corporate directors, professors, teachers, and clergymen entering those professions. (57) Although the oath did not expressly declare the guilt of those who refused to take it and instead adjudged punishment subsequently only upon such refusal, the difference was \"one of form only, and not of substance.\" (58) Garland featured a similar test oath, this one passed by Congress and applying to attorneys practicing in the federal courts. (59) Relying on Cummings, the Court found that the Congressional oath similarly \"operate[d] as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion,\" which constituted punishment. (60)</p><p>The final years of the century saw two unsuccessful bill of attainder challenges against professional-qualification requirements in Dent v. West Virginia (61) in 1889 and in Hawker v. New York (62) in 1898. In Dent, the Court upheld a state law requiring physicians to obtain a degree from an accredited medical school in order to secure a medical license because it was a bona fide judgment of requisite professional qualifications. (63) And in Hawker, the Court followed the same rationale in upholding a state law prohibiting convicted felons from practicing medicine. (64)</p><p>2. The Lovett Bellwether and Justice Frankfurter's Historicism. The Court heard its next bill of attainder challenge in 1946 in United States v. Lovett, (65) Lovett was a challenge to a section of an appropriations bill that prohibited three named federal employees from being paid unless they were confirmed by the Senate. (66) In holding that the section was a bill of attainder, (67) the Court looked to the bill's legislative history to determine the section's purpose, finding a punitive legislative motive. (68) The Court then reviewed the Test Oath Cases, reading them to \"stand for the proposition that legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.\" (69)</p><p>Justice Frankfurter wrote an influential concurrence in Lovett, arguing that the Bill of Attainder Clause was defined by the historical grievances that motivated the Framers to draft it. (70) According to Justice Frankfurter, the Constitution did not define bill of attainder because its \"meaning was so settled by history that definition was superfluous.\" (71) History had defined bill of attainder to mean \"the substitution of legislative determination of guilt and legislative imposition of punishment for judicial finding and sentence.\" (72) Justice Frankfurter's narrow view guided the Court in a sequence of four casts--American Communications Association v. Douds (73) in 1950, Garner v. Board of Public Works (74) in 1951, Flemming v. Nestor (75) in 1960, and Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board (76) in 1961--before the Court offered its current attainder doctrine.</p><p>3. Brown's Foundation and Beyond: Contemporary Doctrine. Although the 1946 Lovett decision served as a preview of the Court's contemporary bill of attainder jurisprudence, the Court did not revisit its broader doctrine until United States v. Brown (77) in 1965. In Brown, the Court struck down a federal bill of attainder making \"it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer or (except in clerical or custodial positions) as an employee of a labor union.\" (78)</p><p>The Court began its analysis with the \"logical starting place\" of the Bill of Attainder Clause's historical background (79) before considering \"the reasons for [the Clause's] inclusion in the Constitution, and the evils it was designed to eliminate.\" (80) The Court asserted that \"the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended not as a narrow, technical ... prohibition, but rather as an implementation of the separation of powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function, or more simply--trial by legislature.\" (81) Beyond implementing the proper separation of powers among the legislative and judicial branches, the Clause \"also reflected the Framers' belief that the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness, of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons.\" (82) Seeking to guard against the will of the excitable majority, the Clause properly \"limit[ed] legislatures to the task of rulemaking.\" (83)</p><p>The Court's analysis ultimately turned on specificity and punishment. Brown noted that Congress singled out \"members of the Communist Party\" in the challenged section, which demonstrated that \"it plainly is not the case that Congress has merely substituted a convenient shorthand term for a list of the characteristics it was trying to reach\"--in this case, individuals likely to provoke political labor strikes. (84) Rejecting as \"archaic\" a limiting definition of punishment solely as retribution, the Court went on to find that the legislation \"inflict[ed] 'punishment' within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause\" through a broad understanding encompassing retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, and prevention. (85) The Court's opinion concluded with an overarching message: \"Congress must accomplish [its desired] results by rules of general applicability. It cannot specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes is to be levied.\" (86)</p><p>Since Brown, the Court has heard only two bill of attainder cases: Nixon v. Administrator of General Services (87) in 1977 and Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (88) in 1984. In Nixon, the Court upheld the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act in the face of a bill of attainder challenge. (89) The Act ordered an executive branch official \"to take custody of the Presidential papers and tape recordings of ... former President Richard M. Nixon\" and to promulgate corresponding regulations. (90) Emphasizing that the Bill of Attainder Clause does not limit \"Congress to the choice of legislating for the universe, or legislating only benefits, or not legislating at all,\" (91) the Court noted that the Act's specificity in referencing only Nixon \"does not automatically offend the Bill of Attainder Clause\" and \"can be fairly and rationally understood\" because Nixon was the only president whose effects were not yet under congressional control--Nixon \"constituted a legitimate class of one.\" (92) In addition to the new \"legitimate class of one\" language, Nixon is notable for its tripartite analysis of punishment, composed of historical, functional, and motivational tests. (93) The historical test looks to \"the substantial experience of both England and the United States\" for \"a ready checklist of deprivations and disabilities\" that \"would be immediately constitutionally suspect.\" (94) The functional test analyzes \"whether the law under challenge, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes.\" (95) Specifically, \"[w]here such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear, it is reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decisionmakers.\" (96) Finally, the motivational test considers \"whether the legislative record evinces a congressional intent to punish.\" (97) The results of these tests are balanced to determine the legislation's constitutionality, and a challenged statute need not fail each test to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder. (98)</p><p>In 1984, the Court in Selective Service System rejected a bill of attainder challenge to a section of the Military Selective Service Act, \"which denie[d] federal financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to male students who fail to register for the draft.\" (99) The Court noted that the challenged section did not single out nonregistrants because it allowed them to seek Title IV's financial assistance if they registered for selective service belatedly upon receiving notice of their unregistered status. (100) Applying the three tests for punishment from Nixon, the Court found that the section did not impose punishment either. (101) The Court has not subsequently heard any bill of attainder cases.</p><p>II. CORPORATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</p><p>\"It is often said that corporations have no souls.\" (102) True enough. But, of course, our law's protection is not limited to natural persons: corporations have long enjoyed constitutional rights. The Supreme Court first considered whether a constitutional provision extended to corporations in 1809 in Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, (103) in which it held that the Bank was a citizen for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction under Article III and the Judiciary Act of 1789. (104) While the Court has since denied corporations various constitutional protections, (105) it has proceeded on a case-by-case basis to recognize a broad swath of corporate constitutional rights. (106)</p><p>In more than two centuries of cases, the Court has offered no clear or consistent test under which to analyze corporate constitutional rights. (107) Two primary analytical frameworks offer distinct approaches to the issue. One option comes from the Court's differing conceptions of corporate personhood, a doctrine recognizing that \"[o]ne of the fundamental defining characteristics of the corporation is that it constitutes a separate legal person with rights and obligations distinct from those of its owners.\" (108) A second option lies in a footnote in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, (109) which sets out the closest thing the Court has formulated to a test for corporate constitutional rights. (110) This Part will address these two frameworks in turn.</p><p>A. Corporate Personhood</p><p>Since the very creation of the corporate form, jurists have struggled to craft a blanket definition of the corporation. (111) One reasonable starting point is to observe that \"[i]n the United States, the technical, albeit tautological, answer is that it is an entity recognized by state law as a 'corporation.'\" (112) Tautology offers descriptive precision here, as corporations truly are defined by state law. (113) Yet when courts consider whether corporations possess certain constitutional rights, a thorough reading of the Delaware General Corporation Law, for example, does little work.</p><p>Rather than agonize over the substance of state law, theories of corporate personhood engage more directly with questions about legal entitlements. Deeply misunderstood, (114) corporate personhood is, at its core, the idea of \"corporations as right[s] holders.\" (115) In other words, \"a corporation has its own independent identity in the eyes of the law, wholly separate from the people who comprise it.\" (116) Corporate personhood has undergirded the Court's piecemeal consideration of the Constitution's application to corporations since the process began in 1809 in Deveaux. There, the Court understood the corporation to be \"a mere creature of the law, invisible, intangible, and incorporeal,\" (117) although \"this invisible, incorporeal creature of the law may be considered as having corporeal qualities.\" (118)</p><p>Even as the Court has not espoused a unified understanding of corporate personhood in its corporate constitutional rights cases, (119) three primary theories of corporate personhood--the artificial entity theory, the real entity theory, and the aggregation theory--have largely persisted since the creation of the corporate form in Roman law more than two thousand years ago. (120) And the Court has endorsed each theory at various points in its corporate constitutional rights cases.</p><p>1. Artificial Entity Theory. The artificial entity theory predominated the Court's corporate constitutional right cases through roughly 1850, (121) understanding \"the corporation as an entity existing separately from its shareholders and other participants.\" (122) Under this view, the corporation was artificial because it \"owed its existence to the positive law of the state rather than to the private initiative of individual incorporators.\" (123) In other words, the corporation was \"a state-created reification.\" (124) At the time of the Founding, state legislatures retained the power to grant corporate charters. (125) This era predated the onset of general state incorporation laws; instead, the formation of each individual corporation required a special legislative act. (126) On this basis, if the corporation were simply a fictional creation--a concession or grant (127)--of the state, the government ought to be able to regulate it, rendering it a partial rather than complete authorization to operate in the corporate form. (128) In 1819, Chief Justice Marshall described the corporation in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, (129) the \"seminal Supreme Court case adopting the artificial entity theory,\" (130) as \"an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly, or as incidental to its very existence.\" (131) In our current era, however, the artificial entity theory has fallen out of style. (132) But Chief Justice Marshall's conception of the artificial entity remains a favorite of judges today, (133) perhaps for its florid language.</p><p>2. Real Entity Theory. As the number of corporations grew from the 1850s through the 1880s, the accompanying legal conception moved \"away from juridical constructs and toward the social reality of the business and the creative energy of the individuals conducting it.\" (134) In this era, states shifted from issuing individual corporate concessions to enacting largely standardized general corporation laws with \"provisions respecting corporate purposes, directors' powers, capital structure, dividends, amendments, and mergers.\" (135)</p><p>Against this backdrop, the ascendant real entity or natural entity theory \"conceived of the corporation as the creation of private initiative rather than state power.\" (136) Central to the real entity theory was the belief \"that a corporation is a being with attributes not found among the humans who are its components.\" (137) Under this conception, the corporation was viewed not as a mere legal fiction of \"sovereign grace\" but instead with a focus on \"the social reality of the business and the creative energy of the individuals conducting it.\" (138) In a natural outgrowth of this view of the corporation, many states eliminated regulations on corporate activity, viewing it as fundamentally analogous to individual business activity--which was not subject to such extensive public-welfare regulation. (139)</p><p>Legal realist critiques, most notably John Dewey's influential 1926 Yale Law Journal essay, The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality, (140) played a strong role in effectuating the demise of the theory. (141) Dewey argued that corporate personhood itself was entirely indeterminate--\"put roughly, 'person' signifies what law makes it signify\" (142)--and that it was merely a malleable mechanism through which to assert the proponent's desired policy ends. (143) Dewey's critique largely ended discussions of corporate personhood, at least until the 1980s. (144)</p><p>3. Aggregation Theory. Aside from the shift from artificial to natural entity, a second debate took place as the nineteenth century came to a close about whether the corporation was an entity distinct from its component individuals or rather an aggregate of those individuals. (145) Early proponents of the aggregation theory posited the corporation as \"an association formed by the agreement of its shareholders\" and argued that \"the existence of a corporation as an entity, independent[] of its members, is a fiction.\" (146) The \"aggregation\" in the theory's name referred to the notion of the corporation as \"an aggregation composed of shareholders and management, the latter confined to labor for the interests of shareholders by standard principles of property and trust law.\" (147) Adherents to this view argued that \"the fact that private individuals had chosen to do business as a corporation should not be a basis for subjecting their financial interests to regulation that otherwise would not apply.\" (148)</p><p>Aggregation theory grounded the earlier application of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses to corporations in the 1882 circuit court decision, County of San Mateo v. Southern Pacific Railroad (149) and the subsequent 1886 Supreme Court case, County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad. (150) Riding circuit, Justice Field wrote in San Mateo:</p><p>Private corporations are, it is true, artificial persons, but ... they consist of aggregations of individuals united for some legitimate business.... It would be a most singular result if a constitutional provision intended for the protection of every person against partial and discriminating legislation by the states, should cease to exert such protection the moment the person becomes a member of a corporation. We cannot accept such a conclusion.... [T]he property of a corporation is in fact the property of the corporators. To deprive the corporation of its property, or to burden it, is, in fact, to deprive the corporators of their property or to lessen its value. (151)</p><p>Chief Justice Waite endorsed this understanding for the Court in Santa Clara (152) although through a headnote written by the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions rather than a formal opinion. (153)</p><p>The Court's more recent corporate constitutional rights cases have not followed a uniform theory of corporate personhood. (154) The legal academy, however, has seen a renewed interest in the concept since the 1980s, (155) and various commentators have argued that the leading contemporary understanding of corporations fits within the aggregation theory. (156)</p><p>B. Bellotti's Ineffectual Test for Corporate Constitutional Rights</p><p>The Court itself has given little explicit guidance on how to determine whether a corporation possesses a constitutional right. The closest it has come to formulating a test for corporate constitutional rights came in a footnote in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (157) in 1978. Writing for the Court, Justice Powell offered the supposed test:</p><p>Certain \"purely personal\" guarantees ... are unavailable to corporations and other organizations because the \"historic function\" of the particular guarantee has been limited to the protection of individuals.... Whether or not a particular guarantee is \"purely personal\" or is unavailable to corporations for some other reason depends on the nature, history, and purpose of the particular constitutional provision. (158)</p><p>Commentators have attacked the Bellotti framework on various grounds. For instance, Professor Darrell Miller calls it \"superficially attractive but practically disappointing,\" arguing that the test fails to reflect the Court's actual practice of asserting corporate constitutional rights ipse dixit. (159) Miller further asserts that the test rebuffs the recognition of many of the pre-Bellotti rights, suggests a categorical binary between protecting corporations or not that cannot be found in existing doctrine, fails to engage with underlying understandings of corporate personhood, and perhaps unwittingly makes the finding of such rights a rebuttable presumption without clarifying how this presumption may be rebutted. (160) Professor Elizabeth Pollman observes that \"[t]he Court has not consistently used [the Bellotti] approach or shown that it would be possible to do so in the context of corporations,\" arguing that the Court has neither clarified the meaning of a \"purely personal\" right nor regularly looked to the \"historic function\" of the right in question. (161) Moreover, Pollman contends that in practice, judicial analysis of history does not decisively settle the Founders' views of corporate rights. (162) Discussing Bellotti in the Bill of Rights context, Professor Mark Tushnet charges that \"[s]orting the Amendments into the boxes 'available to corporations' and 'not available to corporations' appears to require some consideration of each Amendment's purposes\"--a process which \"is itself complex.\" (163) Criticism abounds.</p><p>III. CORPORATE PROTECTION UNDER THE BILL OF ATTAINDER CLAUSE</p><p>Having set out the history and precedent of the Bill of Attainder Clause, as well as the Court's practice of recognizing corporate constitutional rights, this Note now shifts to demonstrate that the Bill of Attainder Clause's protections extend to corporations under the existing doctrinal structures of corporate personhood and a purposive inquiry. This Part first reviews the Second Circuit's deficient analysis in the only federal circuit court holding that the Clause covers corporations. It then analyzes the corporate constitutional right against bills of attainder under theories of corporate personhood, observing that the contemporary theories support the Clause's extension to corporations, before finally discussing how the Clause's purposes also implicate corporations.</p><p>A. The Second Circuit's Deficient Analysis</p><p>The Second Circuit is the only federal circuit court to decide whether the Bill of Attainder Clause extends to corporations--holding in ConEdison that it does. (164) Although this Note argues that the Second Circuit's ultimate holding is correct, the court's reasoning is deeply flawed. The case arose out of a New York statute enacted in response to a power outage at a ConEdison nuclear facility that was partially responsible for providing power to New York City. In order to meet power demands during this roughly eleven-month outage, ConEdison needed to purchase external electricity from other sources. (165) Under existing New York law, ConEdison \"would have been able to pass on to its customers approximately $250 million in increased costs,\" according to New York State Public Service Commission estimates. (166) Instead, the state legislature passed a law prohibiting ConEdison from \"recovering from its ratepayers any costs associated with replacing the power from [the outage].\" (167)</p><p>Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Walker determined that the Bill of Attainder Clause does apply to corporations--striking down the New York law at issue as an unconstitutional bill of attainder against ConEdison. (168) The opinion began by quoting Chief Justice Marshall's artificial-entity conception of the corporation from Dartmouth College (169) before noting a range of recognized corporate constitutional rights. (170) The court then considered two statements from the Supreme Court, dubiously viewing each to signal that the Bill of Attainder Clause covers corporations. (171)</p><p>1. Supreme Court Precedent. First, the Second Circuit looked to South Carolina v. Katzenbach, (172) the 1966 Voting Rights Act case in which the Supreme Court considered whether the word \"person\" in the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause encompassed states. (173) The Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Warren, firmly denied this possibility, viewing as analogous that \"courts have consistently regarded the Bill of Attainder Clause of Article I and the principle of the separation of powers only as protections for individual persons and private groups, those who are peculiarly vulnerable to non-judicial determinations of guilt.\" (174) The opinion cited Brown and Garland for that proposition (175)--the former featuring a prohibition on Communist Party members from belonging to labor unions (176) and the latter addressing a loyalty oath requiring all attorneys practicing in federal court to affirm that they never served in the Confederate government. (177) In this context, \"groups\" most accurately refers to groups of individuals. Katzenbach itself and both Brown and Garland say nothing about corporations, and Katzenbach says nothing beyond a sole line about the Bill of Attainder Clause. It strains the imagination to understand Katzenbach as providing substantive support for the Clause's coverage of corporations.</p><p>In ConEdison, the Second Circuit then considered a footnote from Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, (178) a 1995 case in which the Supreme Court held that Congress had violated the separation of powers in enacting a statute directing federal courts to reopen final judgments for a specified class of cases. (179) In Plaut, the judgment was against a corporation--Spendthrift Farm. Justice Scalia observed that the infringement upon the judicial power \"consisted] not of the Legislature's acting in a particularized and hence ... non-legislative fashion; but rather of the Legislature's nullifying prior, authoritative judicial action.\" (180) In an intervening footnote, Justice Scalia added an ancillary remark about particularized legislation in general:</p><p>The premise that there is something wrong with particularized legislative action is of course questionable. While legislatures usually act through laws of general applicability, that is by no means their only legitimate mode of action. Private bills in Congress are still common, and were even more so in the days before establishment of the Claims Court. Even laws that impose a duty or liability upon a single individual or firm are not on that account invalid--or else we would not have the extensive jurisprudence that we do concerning the Bill of Attainder Clause, including cases which say that it requires not merely \"singling out\" but also punishment, and a case which says that Congress may legislate \"a legitimate class of one.\" (181)</p><p>The Plaut footnote cannot plausibly be taken to signal a wholly novel constitutional understanding. The Court \"does not hide elephants in mouseholes.\" (182) Naturally, Justice Scalia swept \"firm[s]\" into his discussion to ensure its applicability to Spendthrift Farm. He made no acknowledgement whatsoever about the never-before-announced protection of corporations by the Bill of Attainder Clause, nor did he cite any support for or acknowledge the potential gravity of his statement. The Second Circuit's single paragraph in ConEdison discussing Katzenbach and Plaut entirely failed to account for the contexts of those cases. (183)</p><p>2. Corporate Constitutional Rights Generally. After considering precedent, the Second Circuit then considered corporate constitutional rights more generally. It focused on the Bellotti footnote framework, concluding that bill of attainder protection is not a purely personal guarantee, meaning that it is a corporate constitutional right. (184) The court came to this conclusion for two reasons. First, it noted that \"the 'historical function' of the Clause has been to ensure the procedural protections of the judicial process for the attribution of guilt and imposition of punishment,\" a constitutional guarantee \"closely related to the right to procedural due process\" (185) and enjoyed by corporations. (186) Second, it asserted that \"the cases in which the Court has refused to apply constitutional rights to corporations have uniformly involved competing state interests in regulating corporate conduct and investigating corporate wrongdoing, which depend on a high degree of transparency.\" (187) In this case, the Second Circuit observed that \"[although New York unquestionably ha[d] an interest in investigating, regulating, and prosecuting the malfeasance of corporations within its borders, it ha[d] no interest in inflicting punishment for such malfeasance on the corporation's shareholders through the legislative process.\" (188) Instead, New York \"ha[d] an existing administrative procedure to vindicate the interest in exploring utilities' wrongdoing: the [Public Service Commission's] prudence review process.\" (189)</p><p>The Second Circuit seemed to believe that the offensiveness of the statute under review should shape the contours of the Bill of Attainder Clause itself. Under the pretense of a generalized appraisal of the Bill of Attainder Clause's potential coverage of corporations, the court engaged in a partial merits analysis of the challenge before it. Employing the Second Circuit's approach, a less-objectionable statute would have weighed against recognizing the corporate constitutional right against bills of attainder--potentially enough for the court to have held that the Clause does not cover corporations, thereby foreclosing an entire constitutional protection simply because the first corporate attainder challenge decided by the court happened to be weak on the merits. The preliminary question of whether or not there is a corporate constitutional right is entirely distinct from the second question of whether or not the invocation of that right will succeed in light of the facts of the case. The court erred in considering the merits of the challenge at issue when deciding whether the Bill of Attainder Clause applies to corporations. Rather, it should have determined whether the constitutional right exists generally, without relying on the specific facts of the case. The existence of a constitutional right in the first place cannot hinge in any part on whether or not that right was violated.</p><p>Next, the Second Circuit analogized the Bill of Attainder Clause to the Takings Clause's protection of corporations, arguing that legislative punishment, similar to legislative takings, imposes economic injury. \"For both ... Clauses, if the protections did not extend to corporations, their protections would be significantly undermined for individuals\" because \"[w]hen a corporation suffers an economic injury, its shareholders suffer the same economic injury.\" (190) The court justified allowing corporations to challenge laws under the Clause \"[i]n order to protect shareholders from ... economic injuries.\" (191) This explanation is startlingly incomplete. Might corporate bill of attainder challenges be levied only against those laws inflicting economic harm upon shareholders? The Second Circuit wholly failed to acknowledge, for example, punitive laws that restrict management's freedom to make decisions on behalf of the corporation but that do not harm shareholders financially.</p><p>3. History. Finally, the Second Circuit considered historical practice. The court forthrightly acknowledged that the parties and the court were \"unable to unearth any case in which a corporation has ultimately prevailed [on the merits] in challenging legislation as a bill of attainder.\" (192) Yet it favorably noted that ConEdison cited \"several English statutes that imposed disabilities on English boroughs, hardly natural persons,\" (193) because they were structured as corporations. (194) Perhaps these statutes were perfectly acceptable, as the mere imposition of a disability is not the same thing as targeted legislative punishment. Nixon very clearly observed that \"[f]orbidden legislative punishment is not involved merely because [an a]ct imposes burdensome consequences.\" (195) Disabilities in this context are simply burdensome consequences, while punishment requires a determination of intent. (196) ConEdison failed to acknowledge the distinction, offering no evidence that the cited English statutes were actually bills of pains and penalties.</p><p>As the only federal circuit court decision to hold whether or not the Bill of Attainder Clause covers corporations, ConEdison stands on unique ground to influence future corporate bill of attainder challenges. Indeed, other circuits have favorably cited the Second Circuit's opinion when assuming without deciding that the Clause extends to corporations. (197) With a misguided and inadequate foundation, judicial administration of corporate bill of attainder challenges is bound to suffer. In ConEdison, the Second Circuit interpreted Supreme Court precedent in a dubious manner, assessed the merits of the specific challenge when attempting to construe the Clause's general meaning, and offered an incomplete understanding of historical practice. Rather than rely on ConEdison's shaky analysis, the next Section establishes that future courts should engage directly with corporate personhood and the purposes of the Bill of Attainder Clause in order to determine whether the Clause does in fact extend to protect corporations.</p><p>B. Corporate Personhood Analysis</p><p>Having considered the precedent and history of the Bill of Attainder Clause, this Note now considers corporate constitutional rights more generally. Lying beneath the Court's corporate constitutional rights jurisprudence is corporate personhood, with each of the three major theories giving rise to unique implications for a potential corporate constitutional right against bills of attainder. Although the Court continues to debate corporate personhood in its corporate constitutional rights decisions, (198) the influence and usage of the artificial entity theory has fallen significantly.199 This Section argues that the bygone artificial entity theory should be rejected because it enables the subversion of the Clause's existing protections of individuals and that the real entity and aggregation theories provide strong support for a corporate right against bills of attainder.</p><p>1. Artificial Entity Theory. Today, the artificial entity theory is the least frequently employed of the three corporate personhood theories, with Professor Pollman observing that the \"Supreme Court had largely shifted away from [the artificial entity] view by 1950, and the Court has since called it an 'extreme position.\"' (200) Nevertheless, incorporation does still require government recognition, although it is a mere formality to obtain. (201) Modern proponents of the artificial entity theory have interpreted the concept in different ways, with some arguing for a rebuttable presumption against corporate constitutional rights (202) and others arguing for unrestrained legislative power to deny such rights. (203)</p><p>Setting aside the artificial entity theory's fall from influence, the theory is deficient because it provides a potential means for legislatures to subvert the Bill of Attainder Clause. The state's power to grant a right--in this case, the legislature's authorization of corporate charter itself--does not itself give the state indiscriminate power to violate that right. (204) But the artificial entity theory could mean that because the legislature's technical permission to incorporate is what creates the corporation at all, the legislature can instead offer partial permission for the corporation to exist--perhaps reserving the power to punish. If the legislature can authorize a whole, unencumbered corporation, the thinking goes, it can also authorize a corporation with limitations.</p><p>Regardless, the individuals comprising the corporation possess a constitutional right against bills of attainder unaltered by an artificial entity conception of the corporation as a concession of the state. The Bill of Attainder Clause would be undermined if it were understood only to protect individuals when the attainder statute singled them out but not when a statute with identical effects and motivated by identical legislative intent were passed instead against the corporation comprised of those individuals. Imagine, for example, a bill of attainder punishing a group of corporate managers for professional misbehavior by prohibiting them from implementing certain management practices. Punishing the corporation instead, the legislature could pass an analogous statute singling out the corporation and having the very same effect. Because the artificial entity theory may provide a theoretical foundation enabling legislatures to evade the Bill of Attainder Clause's settled protection of individuals, the theory should be rejected as a basis for determining whether or not the Clause applies to corporations.</p><p>2. Real Entity Theory. The real entity theory, focusing on the inherent distinction between the corporation itself and the people whose energies combine to shape it, directly raises the question of whether corporations must be covered by the Bill of Attainder Clause in order to protect the interests of their human components. (205) The targeted legislative punishment of a corporation might very well inflict unchecked, indirect punishment on shareholders, managers, directors, or other employees.</p><p>Setting aside other constitutional claims, imagine a statute targeted at a specific corporation that strips shareholders of their rightful shares or directors of their rightful votes. Under Nixon's tripartite punishment analysis, a challenged statute need fail only one or two of the three tests to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder. (206) Such a statute would clearly fail the historical test for punishment under the Bill of Attainder Clause, as it does not impose a death sentence. However, the law might satisfy the functional test because the burdens it imposes could be viewed to further only punitive purposes. Similarly, the law might also satisfy the motivational test if there were evidence of punitive legislative ambitions in the record.</p><p>Punitive legislation that only reduces the value of shareholders' stock produces a trickier example, as it would, of course, present a question of degree: how drastic must the effect on share price be to fail the functional test? Absent a damning legislative record that would emphatically satisfy the motivational test, courts might defer to legislative judgment. In this example, however, the existing protection of individuals under the Clause would fail to encompass the statute at issue because the statute would single out the corporation itself rather than the shareholders who, in effect, would receive the punishment--even though the statute would clearly inflict punishment on the corporation's human stakeholders. Consequently, the Bill of Attainder Clause would extend to corporations under the real entity theory because corporate coverage is necessary to protect the rights of the people behind the corporation.</p><p>3. Aggregation Theory. The aggregation theory begets the same result as the real entity theory: corporate protection from bills of attainder. The aggregation theory looks at the rights, duties, and expectations of a corporation's constituent natural persons and seeks to ensure a meaningful degree of equality between those and the legal entitlements the constituents would have had if they had not opted to utilize the corporate form to do business. A statute targeting a corporation that reduces the value of shareholders' rightful shares or strips directors of their rightful votes would, in effect, impose a penalty on those individuals for voluntarily incorporating rather than contracting in an ad hoc fashion. This outcome would be impermissible under the aggregation theory, as the corporation's stakeholders would enjoy fewer legal entitlements--in this case, constitutional rights--solely because they chose to incorporate. Under this theory, the Bill of Attainder Clause would extend to corporations as well.</p><p>C. The Purposes of the Bill of Attainder Clause</p><p>A complete analysis of the Bill of Attainder Clause's potential extension to corporations must also consider whether the Clause's purposes necessarily implicate corporations in similar ways to individuals, who unquestionably fall within the Clause's coverage. While some jurists have argued that the Bill of Attainder Clause's purpose was to prevent the legislature from enacting criminal punishments, (207) today the Clause extends beyond the criminal realm and into punishment more broadly. (208) Commentators have offered various views of the Bill of Attainder Clause's purpose over the decades, (209) and Professor Aaron Caplan has synthesized the most influential proposals into four key constitutional values served by the Clause: procedural fairness, separation of powers, equality, and the elimination of political persecution. (210)</p><p>1. Procedural Fairness. Professor Akhil Amar describes the procedural fairness element, observing that the Clause's purpose is partially \"rooted in narrow ideas of adjudicative due process.\" (211) \"In general,\" he stresses, \"the legislature must prescribe penalties generally and prospectively, behind a suitably impersonal veil of ignorance.\" (212) The prohibition on bills of attainder prevents the legislature from \"singling] out its enemies--or the politically unpopular--and condemning] them for who they are, or for what they have done in the past and can no longer change.\" (213) Instead, \"[t]he Attainder Clause channels punishment into the courts which are governed by the many procedural protections of Article III and of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\" (214) Corporations, too, may suffer if punished without a fair process.</p><p>While the nature of legislative adjudication of corporate punishment differs from that directed toward natural persons, (215) it is subject to the same potential procedural abuses. In prohibiting the legislature from condemning specified actors for who they are or what they have previously done, the Bill of Attainder Clause's purpose of preserving procedural fairness implicates corporations.</p><p>2. Separation of Powers. Professor John Hart Ely offers the defining account of the Bill of Attainder Clause as an exercise of the separation of powers, arguing that the Clause \"establishes that there are certain types of decision that are in varying degrees inappropriate for legislative resolution, although specific definition of those limitations ... appears impossible.\" (216) Professor Laurence Tribe has also endorsed this view. (217) And the Court asserted in Brown that \"the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended not as a narrow, Technical ... prohibition, but rather as an implementation of the separation of powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function, or more simply--trial by legislature.\" (218) Indeed, \"the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons.\" (219)</p><p>The legislature is no more equipped to mete out punishment to corporations than to individuals; nothing inherent in the corporate form distinguishes it from natural persons in this regard. Operating to preserve separation of powers, the Bill of Attainder Clause concerns corporations as well as individuals.</p><p>3. Equality. Professor Amar also observes the equality purpose of the Clause, as the legislature's properly drawn punitive laws--general and prospective in nature--afford \"[t]hose who seek to avoid the noose ... fair warning that they must refrain from [the outlawed] conduct.\" (220) Professor Roderick Hills refers to this as the Clause's \"rule against closed classes,\" because while the Clause \"do[es] not necessarily bar legal burdens based on status per se,\" it does bar such burdens imposed through \"classifications based on 'irreversible' status--that is, on legally closed classifications with a membership that is, therefore, permanently fixed upon enactment.\" (221) This rule is designed to prevent the legislature from being able to \"launch 'surgical strikes' against unpopular groups, confident that such burdens will not affect favored constituents upon whom the legislator depends.\" (222) And the rule itself emerges out of the \"tradition of minimal impartiality,\" \"a deep constitutional tradition that governmental decisions cannot rest on a mere desire to impose costs on one person or group for the benefit of another person or group; the identity of the burdened persons ought to be irrelevant to the purpose of the burden.\" (223) Without the rule against closed classes, it \"is otherwise impossible to guarantee [a minimal degree of impartiality] in the legislative context through institutional design,\" unlike in the judicial context. (224)</p><p>When the legislature specifies the target of a bill of attainder, it imposes punishment based on the target's fixed identity. A corporation singled out on the basis of \"who\" it is can no less escape punishment than can individuals singled out on the basis of who they are. Maintaining the equality of the legislature's laws in their application, the Bill of Attainder Clause embraces corporations.</p><p>4. Elimination of Political Persecution. Caplan notes that the Bill of Attainder Clause \"joins a cluster of constitutional provisions that seek to eliminate political persecution and show trials.\" (225) In his historical account of English bills of attainder, Professor Zechariah Chafee documented that most were used to remove high officials from office, either because the King himself sought the disposal of members of his administration who had grown too powerful or because Parliament needed a practical outlet to placate a populace unhappy with royal policies. (226) But the Constitution establishes impeachment as the only mechanism for the congressional removal of high officials. (227) The Bill of Attainder Clause, Caplan asserts, \"serves to channel legislative discontent against ministers into the impeachment process where it belongs.\" (228)</p><p>Whether or not the political-persecution purpose implicates corporations depends on its level of abstraction. If the Clause is viewed merely as a formal channeling mechanism into the impeachment process, the purposes of its protections do not implicate corporations. But if the Clause instead stands as a bulwark against the political passions of the majority, corporations are implicated in much the same way as individuals; legislators can foment anger against corporate enemies just as they rouse the citizenry against natural persons reputed to be antagonists. (229)</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle are increasingly stoking populist resentment of corporate America, (230) while the concentration of wealth among the largest corporations continues to grow. (231) At the same time, the federal government has grown increasingly suspicious of a range of foreign corporations doing business in the United States, as it faces the prospect of heavy-handed nation-states leaning on their globally integrated corporate underlings to perform cyberespionage by proxy. (232) This is where Huawei, the target of a custom-fitting statute banning the federal use of its products, enters the picture. (233)</p><p>This Note seeks to guide the conversation about the Bill of Attainder Clause's potential protection of corporations. Huawei's lawsuit is already the second in as many years challenging a congressional ban on a foreign corporation's products. (234) Most recently, at a dispositive motion hearing in Huawei's case, the district court ordered supplemental briefing on whether, as a threshold matter, the Bill of Attainder Clause applies to corporations. (235) Huawei, however, is expected to lose the suit (236) as the government has a strong, nonpunitive national security rationale for the ban and an inoffensive legislative history on its side. But ConEdison shows that corporate bill of attainder challenges are not inherently doomed. Corporations may soon challenge punitive regulatory laws as bills of attainder with increased frequency. Legislators must understand the full extent of the Constitution if they are to act responsibly in enacting laws, and corporate litigants should understand the full extent of their constitutional rights when facing putative statutory punishments. The Bill of Attainder Clause raises earnest considerations for both camps.</p><p>HARRISON A. NEWMAN, Duke University School of Law, J.D. expected 2020; University of Pennsylvania, B.A. 2016.

He is the AgeID spokesman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A corrected version of the story is below:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UK plan to control online porn is watched as test case</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global push to more tightly regulate the internet is spreading to one of the web's biggest and least visible corners: porn</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By KELVIN CHAN</p><p>AP Business Writer</p><p>LONDON (AP) - The global push to more tightly regulate the internet and big tech firms is spreading to one of the web's biggest and least visible corners: porn.</p><p>The British government wants to require porn websites to verify their users are adults. The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p>\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>AgeID spokesman James Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.</p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-632fde45a57b4c318be323d76aea79a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-RYC1-DYN6-W3V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><timeReceived>12:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks.

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p>\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer.

We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers.

He is the AgeID spokesman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A corrected version of the story is below:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UK plan to control online porn is watched as test case</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global push to more tightly regulate the internet is spreading to one of the web's biggest and least visible corners: porn</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By KELVIN CHAN</p><p>AP Business Writer</p><p>The global push to more tightly regulate the internet and big tech firms is spreading to one of the web's biggest and least visible corners: porn.</p><p>The British government wants to require porn websites to verify their users are adults. The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p>\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>AgeID spokesman James Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months.

It is Basecamp, not BaseCamp.8 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Will Make You Feel Like a Smart Investor[1]In 2018, it was cannabis. In 2019, it was 5G. And yet before either of those trends, artificial intelligence (or AI) was growing relentlessly and undeniably. Artificial intelligence stems from the simple fact that computers are getting smarter. And they are being designed to process information faster. The words 'machine learning' are being used to summarize the creation of algorithms, freed from human programmers, which train themselves on massive data sets. Earlier this year, two separate artificial intelligence 'machines' demonstrated the ability to 'read' Wikipedia entries and answer questions better than humans did. But AI is more than a parlor trick. Chances are at some point today, you've experienced a benefit of artificial intelligence. You may have gotten to this page because of an internet search. You may have asked Alexa or your Google Assistant to perform a command. You may have voice-activated your Roomba vacuum. You may have used an AI-powered GPS system to get to wherever you're reading this. In the future, you may be hailing an autonomous car. A virtual assistant will be able to place calls for you to make appointments. But instead of sounding like a robot, the assistant will sound human, with an understanding of context and nuance. And those are just two applications. There will be more because the possibilities of artificial intelligence are expansive. But they can also be somewhat chilling. Many of the functions that are performed by humans today may be made obsolete by AI. But that's a subject for another day. Right now, you want to know how you can profit from this emerging trend. You've come to the right place. In this special presentation, we will take a look at 8 stocks that can help you profit from the artificial intelligence trend.

In an article in the Washington Post for March 30, he wrote that \"we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what's best about it - the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things - while also protecting society from broader harms. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zucker berg and Facebook have been under strong criticism for privacy issues and mishandling of personal information of users. In his op-ed, he called on governments worldwide to ally with social-media companies to regulate online speech. \"Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum. \"</p><p>In addition, he maintained, \"effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the European Union s Genera! Data Protection Regulation, and I agree. / believe it would be good for the Internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework. New privacy regulation in the United States and around the world should build on the protections GDPR provides. \"</p><p>ITEM: The London-based Economist for March 23 is also a fan of the GDPR scheme of antitrust, taxation, and regulation policies. In a piece entitled, \"Europe takes on the tech giants, \" the magazine calls for the United States to adopt its stances. It suggests this \"could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility. \"</p><p>ITEM: Kara Swisher in the New York Times for April 14 (as part of that paper 's \"Privacy Project \") insists that we need \"to put in place some rules - ndes that have real teeth - on big tech companies. ' According to Swisher - editor at large for Recode (a technology news website focusing on the business of Silicon Valley) as well as a contributing writer for the Times - the question is \"what those rules should look like. \" Correction: Some of us are old enough to recall when free speech was prized and a largely unrestrained Interne: was seen as an ideal. We also remember when an American president pointed ou: that the most terrifying words in the English language are: \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"</p><p>Now, unfortunately, far too many maintain that if private companies dcn't control their products appropriately, the federal government - or even an iniernational body - should do it for them, claiming this is necessary for the public good.</p><p>But we are not compelled tc use, for example, Facebook or Twitter. Just because their policies and practices might be deemed objectionable doesn't mean that Congress or some new asinine bureaucracy should be calling the shots for private entities.</p><p>To be sure, there is plenty to dislike about the large social-media companies and their practices, in particular when conservatives are the targets. The Right has also had to deal with a (generally) unfriendly academe, Hollywood, and mass media. Yet, the proper response isn't to establish federal departments of \"fair\" colleges, movies, and publications.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg claims he wants us to be protected from harmful content on his platform - so he is trying to get someone else to do that. That sounds remarkably like a government censor. Then we must ask, as Juvenal did in ancient Rome, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes'1 (\"Who will guard the guards themselves?\")</p><p>One recurrent complaint about major social-media platforms has been their filtering practices, which are biased against conservative websites. Of late, some in Washington have been promoting government-directed \"neutrality\" in that regard, including some legislators generally seen as conservative.</p><p>One of those testifying last year at an April 2018 hearing before the House Committee on the Judiciary, TechFreedom president Berin Sz\u00f3kai, argued that the notion that the federal government \"should police the 'neutrality' of websites is, in effect, a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet.\" He observed that it was \"ironic that such a proposal should come from any Republican,\" especially conservatives long known for opposition to the Fairness Doctrine \"for stifling conservative voices on radio and television.\" It was, as he testified, \"President Reagan whose FCC finally abolished the Fairness Doctrine and Reagan himself who vetoed Democratic legislation to revive the doctrine.\" As Sz\u00f3kai then put it:</p><p>Why conservatives would suddenly embrace the Fairness Doctrine after decades of opposing it is simply baffling. Conservative talk radio was impossible before the Reagan FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, for example. The Fairness Doctrine suppressed heterodox viewpoints and enforced a bland orthodoxy in media. It would do the same for the Internet.</p><p>Concerns about Facebook's potential slant are best addressed through other measures, starting with transparency and user empowerment. Ultimately, the best check on Facebook's power today is the threat of a new Facebook disrupting the company's dominance - just as many younger Internet users abandoned the site first for Instagram and then for Snapchat.</p><p>Is Facebook an invincible, permanent monopoly? No. Indeed, it inevitably takes government help to make a true monopoly. Markets change. Consider a formerly dominant social-networking company and the question posed in 2007 by the U.K.-based Guardian: \"Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly?\" The answer is yes. \"Monopoly\" Myspace employed about 1,600 people in 2009; it now has a staff of about 150. It was \"broken up\" by the marketplace.</p><p>Facebook itself has also been punished by the market: During the year after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal was revealed on March 2018, shareholders lost more than $61.6 billion in value.</p><p>New rules will solidify the hold of companies such as Facebook. Consider the stringent conditions imposed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), being touted for use in the United States by Zuckerberg and others. Complying is expensive, which is an advantage for the wealthier established firms. Indeed, some American newspaper websites (the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, among them) were taken down in Europe rather than pay for compliance - leaving less for European consumers.</p><p>This was one of the results predicted even as the GDPR was being instituted, in a study by analysts at the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). They forecast: \"The economic effects will include greater market concentration, as small firms and startups struggle to comply, conflicting priorities for businesses, greater inconvenience for users, and reduced innovation.\" As summarized by Iain Murray, a vice president at CEI, \"Some of the GDPR's requirements and invented rights, such as the 'right to be forgotten,' conflict with our more fundamental constitutional rights. A global GDPR, if adopted, will chill speech.\" (It took effect in Europe in May 2018.)</p><p>A \"GDPR\" in this country could lead to a government agency or \"third-party standard-setting body\" making decisions on even everyday matters better handled locally or by individuals.</p><p>What if, for example, you posted a photo of your child at First Communion or taking part in a sports competition? That was a question recently addressed by Data Protection Commission (DPC) Ireland. The Irish Independent reported in mid-April that the DPC had to issue \"guidelines\" because of confusion among parents, teachers, and children's organizations over this issue. (If you are worried about the answer, the national DPC ruled, inter alia, that \"taking a photo in public is generally fine; it's what you do with that photo that can potentially become a data protection issue.\" The DPC indicated that this \"type of activity falls under the so-called 'household exemption' under the GDPR, which provides that the GDPR does not apply when a person processes personal data.\" Do we really want Washington to be ruling on such matters?)</p><p>Social media have become a bane in many regards. The president's son Donald Trump, Jr. echoed other critics when writing (in The Hill) not long ago: \"From 'shadowbans' on Facebook and Twitter, to demonetization of YouTube videos, to pulled ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives is long.\" But inflating Big Government authority is not the proper cure for the ailments of Big Business.</p><p>Writing for Fox News (online) in De- ember, John Samples - a vice president at the Cato Institute - also took note of other regulatory problems:</p><p>As early as 2021, liberals may control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Are they likely to use the federal government to make sure companies are fair to conservatives? Of course not. So why give the federal government such new power over private companies?</p><p>Why indeed? And we should be suspicious when we see Big Tech leaders acquiescing rather easily to federal regulation. During the last year, as Nick Gillespie wrote on Reason.com in early April, the heads of Twitter, Google, and Apple, typically before Congress, \"have all announced in favor of'new rules.'\" Indeed, he continued,</p><p>1 Apple's Tim Cook, the CEO of the planet's biggest company, said just last December \"I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn't worked here. I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.... I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\"</p><p>In truth, as mentioned earlier, regulations are likely to help those that are supposedly being restrained.</p><p>The regulations wi.l, among other things, increase costs (essentially hidden taxes passed along to customers); provide tech companies with legal protections (\"outsourcing censorship,\" in the words of a former FTC commissioner); and help erect barriers against entry for potential competitors who don't have Tie political influence or capital of the established firms. Facebook head Zuckerberg acknowledged as much in congressional testimony last year: \"When you add more rules that companies need to follow,\" he said, \"that's something that larger companies like ours just has the resources to go do and it just might be harder for a smaller company just getting started to comply with.\"</p><p>Moreover, those being regulated usually have a considerable say about how that will happen. As explained by Ryan McMaken, a senior editor at the Mises Institute, Facebook would be one of the \"most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to writing the new regulations.\" The company will, McMaken wrote in early April,</p><p>be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors. This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as \"regulatory capture.\" When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency's decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves.</p><p>This is a familiar script. Big Business, by and large, is not a foe of Big Government. They are frequently allies (though that is not the favored progressive tale). When you look more closely, it turns out that Enron, Philip Morris, and General Motors actually supported strict regulations of, respectively, global energy, tobacco advertising, and clean-air regulations. The list goes on - over many decades.</p><p>Once national governments get in the midst of regulating online content, there will be no end of it. The Economisi, which has celebrated how the EU is \"taking the lead\" on these matters, is also apparently keen on \"Britain's approach,\" saying that London hopes that it \"will be adopted elsewhere.\" The publication reported in mid-April about how the U.K. government had just published</p><p>a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms.\" It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online.\" That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else.... Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.</p><p>\"Some\" folks are correct. We don't need to adopt such practices in this country. Or to erect what Mark Zuckerberg calls a \"common global framework.\" Or to promulgate a \"Fairness Doctrine\" for the Internet, as opposed to the freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. *</p><p>- WILLIAM R HOAR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2232658220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-FV81-DY0W-42C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American May 20, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In an article in the Washington Post for March 30, he wrote that \"we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what's best about it - the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things - while also protecting society from broader harms. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zucker berg and Facebook have been under strong criticism for privacy issues and mishandling of personal information of users. In his op-ed, he called on governments worldwide to ally with social-media companies to regulate online speech. \"Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum. \"</p><p>In addition, he maintained, \"effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the European Union s Genera! Data Protection Regulation, and I agree. / believe it would be good for the Internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework. New privacy regulation in the United States and around the world should build on the protections GDPR provides. \"</p><p>ITEM: The London-based Economist for March 23 is also a fan of the GDPR scheme of antitrust, taxation, and regulation policies. In a piece entitled, \"Europe takes on the tech giants, \" the magazine calls for the United States to adopt its stances. It suggests this \"could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility. \"</p><p>ITEM: Kara Swisher in the New York Times for April 14 (as part of that paper 's \"Privacy Project \") insists that we need \"to put in place some rules - ndes that have real teeth - on big tech companies. ' According to Swisher - editor at large for Recode (a technology news website focusing on the business of Silicon Valley) as well as a contributing writer for the Times - the question is \"what those rules should look like. \" Correction: Some of us are old enough to recall when free speech was prized and a largely unrestrained Interne: was seen as an ideal. We also remember when an American president pointed ou: that the most terrifying words in the English language are: \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"</p><p>Now, unfortunately, far too many maintain that if private companies dcn't control their products appropriately, the federal government - or even an iniernational body - should do it for them, claiming this is necessary for the public good.</p><p>But we are not compelled tc use, for example, Facebook or Twitter. Just because their policies and practices might be deemed objectionable doesn't mean that Congress or some new asinine bureaucracy should be calling the shots for private entities.</p><p>To be sure, there is plenty to dislike about the large social-media companies and their practices, in particular when conservatives are the targets. The Right has also had to deal with a (generally) unfriendly academe, Hollywood, and mass media. Yet, the proper response isn't to establish federal departments of \"fair\" colleges, movies, and publications.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg claims he wants us to be protected from harmful content on his platform - so he is trying to get someone else to do that. That sounds remarkably like a government censor. Then we must ask, as Juvenal did in ancient Rome, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes'1 (\"Who will guard the guards themselves?\")</p><p>One recurrent complaint about major social-media platforms has been their filtering practices, which are biased against conservative websites. Of late, some in Washington have been promoting government-directed \"neutrality\" in that regard, including some legislators generally seen as conservative.</p><p>One of those testifying last year at an April 2018 hearing before the House Committee on the Judiciary, TechFreedom president Berin Sz\u00f3kai, argued that the notion that the federal government \"should police the 'neutrality' of websites is, in effect, a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet.\" He observed that it was \"ironic that such a proposal should come from any Republican,\" especially conservatives long known for opposition to the Fairness Doctrine \"for stifling conservative voices on radio and television.\" It was, as he testified, \"President Reagan whose FCC finally abolished the Fairness Doctrine and Reagan himself who vetoed Democratic legislation to revive the doctrine.\" As Sz\u00f3kai then put it:</p><p>Why conservatives would suddenly embrace the Fairness Doctrine after decades of opposing it is simply baffling. Conservative talk radio was impossible before the Reagan FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, for example. The Fairness Doctrine suppressed heterodox viewpoints and enforced a bland orthodoxy in media. It would do the same for the Internet.</p><p>Concerns about Facebook's potential slant are best addressed through other measures, starting with transparency and user empowerment. Ultimately, the best check on Facebook's power today is the threat of a new Facebook disrupting the company's dominance - just as many younger Internet users abandoned the site first for Instagram and then for Snapchat.</p><p>Is Facebook an invincible, permanent monopoly? No. Indeed, it inevitably takes government help to make a true monopoly. Markets change. Consider a formerly dominant social-networking company and the question posed in 2007 by the U.K.-based Guardian: \"Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly?\" The answer is yes. \"Monopoly\" Myspace employed about 1,600 people in 2009; it now has a staff of about 150. It was \"broken up\" by the marketplace.</p><p>Facebook itself has also been punished by the market: During the year after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal was revealed on March 2018, shareholders lost more than $61.6 billion in value.</p><p>New rules will solidify the hold of companies such as Facebook. Consider the stringent conditions imposed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), being touted for use in the United States by Zuckerberg and others. Complying is expensive, which is an advantage for the wealthier established firms. Indeed, some American newspaper websites (the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, among them) were taken down in Europe rather than pay for compliance - leaving less for European consumers.</p><p>This was one of the results predicted even as the GDPR was being instituted, in a study by analysts at the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). They forecast: \"The economic effects will include greater market concentration, as small firms and startups struggle to comply, conflicting priorities for businesses, greater inconvenience for users, and reduced innovation.\" As summarized by Iain Murray, a vice president at CEI, \"Some of the GDPR's requirements and invented rights, such as the 'right to be forgotten,' conflict with our more fundamental constitutional rights. A global GDPR, if adopted, will chill speech.\" (It took effect in Europe in May 2018.)</p><p>A \"GDPR\" in this country could lead to a government agency or \"third-party standard-setting body\" making decisions on even everyday matters better handled locally or by individuals.</p><p>What if, for example, you posted a photo of your child at First Communion or taking part in a sports competition? That was a question recently addressed by Data Protection Commission (DPC) Ireland. The Irish Independent reported in mid-April that the DPC had to issue \"guidelines\" because of confusion among parents, teachers, and children's organizations over this issue. (If you are worried about the answer, the national DPC ruled, inter alia, that \"taking a photo in public is generally fine; it's what you do with that photo that can potentially become a data protection issue.\" The DPC indicated that this \"type of activity falls under the so-called 'household exemption' under the GDPR, which provides that the GDPR does not apply when a person processes personal data.\" Do we really want Washington to be ruling on such matters?)</p><p>Social media have become a bane in many regards. The president's son Donald Trump, Jr. echoed other critics when writing (in The Hill) not long ago: \"From 'shadowbans' on Facebook and Twitter, to demonetization of YouTube videos, to pulled ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives is long.\" But inflating Big Government authority is not the proper cure for the ailments of Big Business.</p><p>Writing for Fox News (online) in De- ember, John Samples - a vice president at the Cato Institute - also took note of other regulatory problems:</p><p>As early as 2021, liberals may control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Are they likely to use the federal government to make sure companies are fair to conservatives? Of course not. So why give the federal government such new power over private companies?</p><p>Why indeed? And we should be suspicious when we see Big Tech leaders acquiescing rather easily to federal regulation. During the last year, as Nick Gillespie wrote on Reason.com in early April, the heads of Twitter, Google, and Apple, typically before Congress, \"have all announced in favor of'new rules.'\" Indeed, he continued,</p><p>1 Apple's Tim Cook, the CEO of the planet's biggest company, said just last December \"I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn't worked here. I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.... I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\"</p><p>In truth, as mentioned earlier, regulations are likely to help those that are supposedly being restrained.</p><p>The regulations wi.l, among other things, increase costs (essentially hidden taxes passed along to customers); provide tech companies with legal protections (\"outsourcing censorship,\" in the words of a former FTC commissioner); and help erect barriers against entry for potential competitors who don't have Tie political influence or capital of the established firms. Facebook head Zuckerberg acknowledged as much in congressional testimony last year: \"When you add more rules that companies need to follow,\" he said, \"that's something that larger companies like ours just has the resources to go do and it just might be harder for a smaller company just getting started to comply with.\"</p><p>Moreover, those being regulated usually have a considerable say about how that will happen. As explained by Ryan McMaken, a senior editor at the Mises Institute, Facebook would be one of the \"most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to writing the new regulations.\" The company will, McMaken wrote in early April,</p><p>be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors. This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as \"regulatory capture.\" When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency's decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves.</p><p>This is a familiar script. Big Business, by and large, is not a foe of Big Government. They are frequently allies (though that is not the favored progressive tale). When you look more closely, it turns out that Enron, Philip Morris, and General Motors actually supported strict regulations of, respectively, global energy, tobacco advertising, and clean-air regulations. The list goes on - over many decades.</p><p>Once national governments get in the midst of regulating online content, there will be no end of it. The Economisi, which has celebrated how the EU is \"taking the lead\" on these matters, is also apparently keen on \"Britain's approach,\" saying that London hopes that it \"will be adopted elsewhere.\" The publication reported in mid-April about how the U.K. government had just published</p><p>a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms.\" It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online.\" That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else.... Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.</p><p>\"Some\" folks are correct. We don't need to adopt such practices in this country. Or to erect what Mark Zuckerberg calls a \"common global framework.\" Or to promulgate a \"Fairness Doctrine\" for the Internet, as opposed to the freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. *</p><p>- WILLIAM R HOAR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2232658220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDC1-JBHT-D49T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American May 20, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In an article in the Washington Post for March 30, he wrote that \"we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what's best about it - the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things - while also protecting society from broader harms. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zucker berg and Facebook have been under strong criticism for privacy issues and mishandling of personal information of users. In his op-ed, he called on governments worldwide to ally with social-media companies to regulate online speech. \"Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum. \"</p><p>In addition, he maintained, \"effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the European Union s Genera! Data Protection Regulation, and I agree. / believe it would be good for the Internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework. New privacy regulation in the United States and around the world should build on the protections GDPR provides. \"</p><p>ITEM: The London-based Economist for March 23 is also a fan of the GDPR scheme of antitrust, taxation, and regulation policies. In a piece entitled, \"Europe takes on the tech giants, \" the magazine calls for the United States to adopt its stances. It suggests this \"could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility. \"</p><p>ITEM: Kara Swisher in the New York Times for April 14 (as part of that paper 's \"Privacy Project \") insists that we need \"to put in place some rules - ndes that have real teeth - on big tech companies. ' According to Swisher - editor at large for Recode (a technology news website focusing on the business of Silicon Valley) as well as a contributing writer for the Times - the question is \"what those rules should look like. \" Correction: Some of us are old enough to recall when free speech was prized and a largely unrestrained Interne: was seen as an ideal. We also remember when an American president pointed ou: that the most terrifying words in the English language are: \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"</p><p>Now, unfortunately, far too many maintain that if private companies dcn't control their products appropriately, the federal government - or even an iniernational body - should do it for them, claiming this is necessary for the public good.</p><p>But we are not compelled tc use, for example, Facebook or Twitter. Just because their policies and practices might be deemed objectionable doesn't mean that Congress or some new asinine bureaucracy should be calling the shots for private entities.</p><p>To be sure, there is plenty to dislike about the large social-media companies and their practices, in particular when conservatives are the targets. The Right has also had to deal with a (generally) unfriendly academe, Hollywood, and mass media. Yet, the proper response isn't to establish federal departments of \"fair\" colleges, movies, and publications.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg claims he wants us to be protected from harmful content on his platform - so he is trying to get someone else to do that. That sounds remarkably like a government censor. Then we must ask, as Juvenal did in ancient Rome, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes'1 (\"Who will guard the guards themselves?\")</p><p>One recurrent complaint about major social-media platforms has been their filtering practices, which are biased against conservative websites. Of late, some in Washington have been promoting government-directed \"neutrality\" in that regard, including some legislators generally seen as conservative.</p><p>One of those testifying last year at an April 2018 hearing before the House Committee on the Judiciary, TechFreedom president Berin Sz\u00f3kai, argued that the notion that the federal government \"should police the 'neutrality' of websites is, in effect, a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet.\" He observed that it was \"ironic that such a proposal should come from any Republican,\" especially conservatives long known for opposition to the Fairness Doctrine \"for stifling conservative voices on radio and television.\" It was, as he testified, \"President Reagan whose FCC finally abolished the Fairness Doctrine and Reagan himself who vetoed Democratic legislation to revive the doctrine.\" As Sz\u00f3kai then put it:</p><p>Why conservatives would suddenly embrace the Fairness Doctrine after decades of opposing it is simply baffling. Conservative talk radio was impossible before the Reagan FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, for example. The Fairness Doctrine suppressed heterodox viewpoints and enforced a bland orthodoxy in media. It would do the same for the Internet.</p><p>Concerns about Facebook's potential slant are best addressed through other measures, starting with transparency and user empowerment. Ultimately, the best check on Facebook's power today is the threat of a new Facebook disrupting the company's dominance - just as many younger Internet users abandoned the site first for Instagram and then for Snapchat.</p><p>Is Facebook an invincible, permanent monopoly? No. Indeed, it inevitably takes government help to make a true monopoly. Markets change. Consider a formerly dominant social-networking company and the question posed in 2007 by the U.K.-based Guardian: \"Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly?\" The answer is yes. \"Monopoly\" Myspace employed about 1,600 people in 2009; it now has a staff of about 150. It was \"broken up\" by the marketplace.</p><p>Facebook itself has also been punished by the market: During the year after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal was revealed on March 2018, shareholders lost more than $61.6 billion in value.</p><p>New rules will solidify the hold of companies such as Facebook. Consider the stringent conditions imposed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), being touted for use in the United States by Zuckerberg and others. Complying is expensive, which is an advantage for the wealthier established firms. Indeed, some American newspaper websites (the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, among them) were taken down in Europe rather than pay for compliance - leaving less for European consumers.</p><p>This was one of the results predicted even as the GDPR was being instituted, in a study by analysts at the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). They forecast: \"The economic effects will include greater market concentration, as small firms and startups struggle to comply, conflicting priorities for businesses, greater inconvenience for users, and reduced innovation.\" As summarized by Iain Murray, a vice president at CEI, \"Some of the GDPR's requirements and invented rights, such as the 'right to be forgotten,' conflict with our more fundamental constitutional rights. A global GDPR, if adopted, will chill speech.\" (It took effect in Europe in May 2018.)</p><p>A \"GDPR\" in this country could lead to a government agency or \"third-party standard-setting body\" making decisions on even everyday matters better handled locally or by individuals.</p><p>What if, for example, you posted a photo of your child at First Communion or taking part in a sports competition? That was a question recently addressed by Data Protection Commission (DPC) Ireland. The Irish Independent reported in mid-April that the DPC had to issue \"guidelines\" because of confusion among parents, teachers, and children's organizations over this issue. (If you are worried about the answer, the national DPC ruled, inter alia, that \"taking a photo in public is generally fine; it's what you do with that photo that can potentially become a data protection issue.\" The DPC indicated that this \"type of activity falls under the so-called 'household exemption' under the GDPR, which provides that the GDPR does not apply when a person processes personal data.\" Do we really want Washington to be ruling on such matters?)</p><p>Social media have become a bane in many regards. The president's son Donald Trump, Jr. echoed other critics when writing (in The Hill) not long ago: \"From 'shadowbans' on Facebook and Twitter, to demonetization of YouTube videos, to pulled ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives is long.\" But inflating Big Government authority is not the proper cure for the ailments of Big Business.</p><p>Writing for Fox News (online) in De- ember, John Samples - a vice president at the Cato Institute - also took note of other regulatory problems:</p><p>As early as 2021, liberals may control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Are they likely to use the federal government to make sure companies are fair to conservatives? Of course not. So why give the federal government such new power over private companies?</p><p>Why indeed? And we should be suspicious when we see Big Tech leaders acquiescing rather easily to federal regulation. During the last year, as Nick Gillespie wrote on Reason.com in early April, the heads of Twitter, Google, and Apple, typically before Congress, \"have all announced in favor of'new rules.'\" Indeed, he continued,</p><p>1 Apple's Tim Cook, the CEO of the planet's biggest company, said just last December \"I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn't worked here. I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.... I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\"</p><p>In truth, as mentioned earlier, regulations are likely to help those that are supposedly being restrained.</p><p>The regulations wi.l, among other things, increase costs (essentially hidden taxes passed along to customers); provide tech companies with legal protections (\"outsourcing censorship,\" in the words of a former FTC commissioner); and help erect barriers against entry for potential competitors who don't have Tie political influence or capital of the established firms. Facebook head Zuckerberg acknowledged as much in congressional testimony last year: \"When you add more rules that companies need to follow,\" he said, \"that's something that larger companies like ours just has the resources to go do and it just might be harder for a smaller company just getting started to comply with.\"</p><p>Moreover, those being regulated usually have a considerable say about how that will happen. As explained by Ryan McMaken, a senior editor at the Mises Institute, Facebook would be one of the \"most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to writing the new regulations.\" The company will, McMaken wrote in early April,</p><p>be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors. This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as \"regulatory capture.\" When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency's decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves.</p><p>This is a familiar script. Big Business, by and large, is not a foe of Big Government. They are frequently allies (though that is not the favored progressive tale). When you look more closely, it turns out that Enron, Philip Morris, and General Motors actually supported strict regulations of, respectively, global energy, tobacco advertising, and clean-air regulations. The list goes on - over many decades.</p><p>Once national governments get in the midst of regulating online content, there will be no end of it. The Economisi, which has celebrated how the EU is \"taking the lead\" on these matters, is also apparently keen on \"Britain's approach,\" saying that London hopes that it \"will be adopted elsewhere.\" The publication reported in mid-April about how the U.K. government had just published</p><p>a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms.\" It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online.\" That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else.... Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.</p><p>\"Some\" folks are correct. We don't need to adopt such practices in this country. Or to erect what Mark Zuckerberg calls a \"common global framework.\" Or to promulgate a \"Fairness Doctrine\" for the Internet, as opposed to the freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. *</p><p>- WILLIAM R HOAR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2232658220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-XGG1-JBHT-D4C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American May 20, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In an article in the Washington Post for March 30, he wrote that \"we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what's best about it - the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things - while also protecting society from broader harms. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zucker berg and Facebook have been under strong criticism for privacy issues and mishandling of personal information of users. In his op-ed, he called on governments worldwide to ally with social-media companies to regulate online speech. \"Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum. \"</p><p>In addition, he maintained, \"effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the European Union s Genera! Data Protection Regulation, and I agree. / believe it would be good for the Internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework. New privacy regulation in the United States and around the world should build on the protections GDPR provides. \"</p><p>ITEM: The London-based Economist for March 23 is also a fan of the GDPR scheme of antitrust, taxation, and regulation policies. In a piece entitled, \"Europe takes on the tech giants, \" the magazine calls for the United States to adopt its stances. It suggests this \"could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility. \"</p><p>ITEM: Kara Swisher in the New York Times for April 14 (as part of that paper 's \"Privacy Project \") insists that we need \"to put in place some rules - ndes that have real teeth - on big tech companies. ' According to Swisher - editor at large for Recode (a technology news website focusing on the business of Silicon Valley) as well as a contributing writer for the Times - the question is \"what those rules should look like. \" Correction: Some of us are old enough to recall when free speech was prized and a largely unrestrained Interne: was seen as an ideal. We also remember when an American president pointed ou: that the most terrifying words in the English language are: \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"</p><p>Now, unfortunately, far too many maintain that if private companies dcn't control their products appropriately, the federal government - or even an iniernational body - should do it for them, claiming this is necessary for the public good.</p><p>But we are not compelled tc use, for example, Facebook or Twitter. Just because their policies and practices might be deemed objectionable doesn't mean that Congress or some new asinine bureaucracy should be calling the shots for private entities.</p><p>To be sure, there is plenty to dislike about the large social-media companies and their practices, in particular when conservatives are the targets. The Right has also had to deal with a (generally) unfriendly academe, Hollywood, and mass media. Yet, the proper response isn't to establish federal departments of \"fair\" colleges, movies, and publications.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg claims he wants us to be protected from harmful content on his platform - so he is trying to get someone else to do that. That sounds remarkably like a government censor. Then we must ask, as Juvenal did in ancient Rome, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes'1 (\"Who will guard the guards themselves?\")</p><p>One recurrent complaint about major social-media platforms has been their filtering practices, which are biased against conservative websites. Of late, some in Washington have been promoting government-directed \"neutrality\" in that regard, including some legislators generally seen as conservative.</p><p>One of those testifying last year at an April 2018 hearing before the House Committee on the Judiciary, TechFreedom president Berin Sz\u00f3kai, argued that the notion that the federal government \"should police the 'neutrality' of websites is, in effect, a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet.\" He observed that it was \"ironic that such a proposal should come from any Republican,\" especially conservatives long known for opposition to the Fairness Doctrine \"for stifling conservative voices on radio and television.\" It was, as he testified, \"President Reagan whose FCC finally abolished the Fairness Doctrine and Reagan himself who vetoed Democratic legislation to revive the doctrine.\" As Sz\u00f3kai then put it:</p><p>Why conservatives would suddenly embrace the Fairness Doctrine after decades of opposing it is simply baffling. Conservative talk radio was impossible before the Reagan FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, for example. The Fairness Doctrine suppressed heterodox viewpoints and enforced a bland orthodoxy in media. It would do the same for the Internet.</p><p>Concerns about Facebook's potential slant are best addressed through other measures, starting with transparency and user empowerment. Ultimately, the best check on Facebook's power today is the threat of a new Facebook disrupting the company's dominance - just as many younger Internet users abandoned the site first for Instagram and then for Snapchat.</p><p>Is Facebook an invincible, permanent monopoly? No. Indeed, it inevitably takes government help to make a true monopoly. Markets change. Consider a formerly dominant social-networking company and the question posed in 2007 by the U.K.-based Guardian: \"Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly?\" The answer is yes. \"Monopoly\" Myspace employed about 1,600 people in 2009; it now has a staff of about 150. It was \"broken up\" by the marketplace.</p><p>Facebook itself has also been punished by the market: During the year after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal was revealed on March 2018, shareholders lost more than $61.6 billion in value.</p><p>New rules will solidify the hold of companies such as Facebook. Consider the stringent conditions imposed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), being touted for use in the United States by Zuckerberg and others. Complying is expensive, which is an advantage for the wealthier established firms. Indeed, some American newspaper websites (the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, among them) were taken down in Europe rather than pay for compliance - leaving less for European consumers.</p><p>This was one of the results predicted even as the GDPR was being instituted, in a study by analysts at the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). They forecast: \"The economic effects will include greater market concentration, as small firms and startups struggle to comply, conflicting priorities for businesses, greater inconvenience for users, and reduced innovation.\" As summarized by Iain Murray, a vice president at CEI, \"Some of the GDPR's requirements and invented rights, such as the 'right to be forgotten,' conflict with our more fundamental constitutional rights. A global GDPR, if adopted, will chill speech.\" (It took effect in Europe in May 2018.)</p><p>A \"GDPR\" in this country could lead to a government agency or \"third-party standard-setting body\" making decisions on even everyday matters better handled locally or by individuals.</p><p>What if, for example, you posted a photo of your child at First Communion or taking part in a sports competition? That was a question recently addressed by Data Protection Commission (DPC) Ireland. The Irish Independent reported in mid-April that the DPC had to issue \"guidelines\" because of confusion among parents, teachers, and children's organizations over this issue. (If you are worried about the answer, the national DPC ruled, inter alia, that \"taking a photo in public is generally fine; it's what you do with that photo that can potentially become a data protection issue.\" The DPC indicated that this \"type of activity falls under the so-called 'household exemption' under the GDPR, which provides that the GDPR does not apply when a person processes personal data.\" Do we really want Washington to be ruling on such matters?)</p><p>Social media have become a bane in many regards. The president's son Donald Trump, Jr. echoed other critics when writing (in The Hill) not long ago: \"From 'shadowbans' on Facebook and Twitter, to demonetization of YouTube videos, to pulled ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives is long.\" But inflating Big Government authority is not the proper cure for the ailments of Big Business.</p><p>Writing for Fox News (online) in De- ember, John Samples - a vice president at the Cato Institute - also took note of other regulatory problems:</p><p>As early as 2021, liberals may control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Are they likely to use the federal government to make sure companies are fair to conservatives? Of course not. So why give the federal government such new power over private companies?</p><p>Why indeed? And we should be suspicious when we see Big Tech leaders acquiescing rather easily to federal regulation. During the last year, as Nick Gillespie wrote on Reason.com in early April, the heads of Twitter, Google, and Apple, typically before Congress, \"have all announced in favor of'new rules.'\" Indeed, he continued,</p><p>1 Apple's Tim Cook, the CEO of the planet's biggest company, said just last December \"I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn't worked here. I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.... I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\"</p><p>In truth, as mentioned earlier, regulations are likely to help those that are supposedly being restrained.</p><p>The regulations wi.l, among other things, increase costs (essentially hidden taxes passed along to customers); provide tech companies with legal protections (\"outsourcing censorship,\" in the words of a former FTC commissioner); and help erect barriers against entry for potential competitors who don't have Tie political influence or capital of the established firms. Facebook head Zuckerberg acknowledged as much in congressional testimony last year: \"When you add more rules that companies need to follow,\" he said, \"that's something that larger companies like ours just has the resources to go do and it just might be harder for a smaller company just getting started to comply with.\"</p><p>Moreover, those being regulated usually have a considerable say about how that will happen. As explained by Ryan McMaken, a senior editor at the Mises Institute, Facebook would be one of the \"most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to writing the new regulations.\" The company will, McMaken wrote in early April,</p><p>be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors. This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as \"regulatory capture.\" When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency's decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves.</p><p>This is a familiar script. Big Business, by and large, is not a foe of Big Government. They are frequently allies (though that is not the favored progressive tale). When you look more closely, it turns out that Enron, Philip Morris, and General Motors actually supported strict regulations of, respectively, global energy, tobacco advertising, and clean-air regulations. The list goes on - over many decades.</p><p>Once national governments get in the midst of regulating online content, there will be no end of it. The Economisi, which has celebrated how the EU is \"taking the lead\" on these matters, is also apparently keen on \"Britain's approach,\" saying that London hopes that it \"will be adopted elsewhere.\" The publication reported in mid-April about how the U.K. government had just published</p><p>a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms.\" It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online.\" That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else.... Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.</p><p>\"Some\" folks are correct. We don't need to adopt such practices in this country. Or to erect what Mark Zuckerberg calls a \"common global framework.\" Or to promulgate a \"Fairness Doctrine\" for the Internet, as opposed to the freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. *</p><p>- WILLIAM R HOAR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2232658220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCJ-3SC1-JBHT-D3HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American May 20, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The second Gilded Age will end at some point. \"</p><p>The article's author believes that democracy will bring about \"an era defined culturally by renewed public purpose and politically by the restoration of the state in areas where people are too powerless to solve problems of their own - defined by the use of shared institutions to solve shared problems. \"</p><p>ITEM: The cover story of the Londonbased Economist dated October 26 touts \"Elizabeth Warren 's many plans \" that \"would reshape American capitalism. \" Using as a premise the inflated worries about the \"long-term shift toward inequality, \" the magazine lauds many (though not all) of her proposals. These include \"a nationalised health-care plan proposed by Mr Sanders which Ms Warren endorses Warren's \"Stop Wall Street Looting Act,\" which would put \"private equity\" \"at risk\"; and her threatened breaking up of large companies and potential \"unwinding\" of mergers that were previously allowed by federal regulators.</p><p>Warren, the Economist notes, \"is not just seeking to change the rules for business. She also sees a big role for government in making America competitive: a role built on industrial policy and protectionism. A new uber-agency called the Department of Economic Development would be charged with creating American jobs. \"</p><p>ITEM: On November I -amid the then-latest official reports showing the United States to be enjoying the strongest labor market in half a century; rising revisions beyond already good jobs totals: an unemployment rate for African-Americans dropping to a record low; and average hourly earnings picking up - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appeared distraught: \"The October jobs report offers further evidence that the Republicans 'disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out the middle class while enriching the wealthy and well-connected. Clearly, the GOP Tax Seam has left our country with nothing but broken promises and an underperforming economy. \"</p><p>CORRECTION: It is said that a wise man (or woman) reflects before he (or she) speaks; a fool speaks and reflects on what he (or she) has uttered. There shouldn't be much argument about where Pelosi fits. Meanwhile, the major Democratic presidential candidates and allied members of Congress are preying on American capital sm and sabotaging the marketplace - doing their utmost to transform our economy into one completely dominated by the central government.</p><p>This is what the left-wingers oppose: According to the Labor Department, U.S nonfarm employers added 266,000 new workers in November; that total was more than double the pace of hiring the previous month and almost 50-percent higher thar. had been forecast by economists. Unemployment matched a 50-year low of 3.5 percent, and wages were up 3.1 percent from f. year earlier. The University of Michigan's gauge of consumer sentiment also rose.</p><p>Other reports, from the Census Bureau, found real median family income up 1.2 percent from 2017 to 2018 and real median earnings up 3.4 percent. At the same time, the number of full-time, year-round workers increased by 2.3 million and the poverty rate dropped, with 1.4 million people officially leaving poverty.</p><p>Encouraging numbers continue. Of course, the economy isn't perfect. It never is. Naturally, to balance the good news nationally, the New York Times for November 1 spent more than 1,600 words (\"What Recovery? Life on the Edge\") and multiple photos profiling one individual unable to find a steady, full-time job. You can count on the Left to emphasize any economic warts or perceived weaknesses (more on that below).</p><p>The public isn't blind. The economy was a key reason behind two relatively recent winning presidential races. Bill Clinton's campaign message stressed \"It's the economy, stupid,\" while Ronald Reagan's successful effort asked voters, \"Are you better \u043e IT than you were four years ago?\" When that question was asked by a recent Economist/ YouGov poll, here was the result (among registered voters): 50 percent said yes and only 32 percent said no (17 percent were not sure).</p><p>Leading Democrats, meanwhile, talk one way and act another. Despite empty Democratic rhetoric about inequality, \"higher taxes, hyper-regulation and income redistribution resulted in more inequality during the Obama Presidency,\" the Wall Street Journal's editors observed this fall. Misrepresenting Trump's actions, Warren and Sanders, among others, maintain that U.S. workers barely share in the gains of today's economy. Bernie even charges that there has been a \"massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one percent.\"</p><p>However, as pointed out by economic commentator Steve Moore, of late \"the biggest percentage gains in wages have been going to people in the lowest 20 percent of income.\" And, as the Wall Street Journal reported in early December, \"Wages are growing faster for rank-and-file workers than some in higher pay brackets.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Trump's potential opponents want to turn the economy upside down. This past summer it was noted in RealClear Politics that the House Judiciary Committee had hired \"a scholar popular for promoting government-forced corporate breakups.\" Antitrust action is in the wind -just waiting for Elizabeth Warren or others of such ilk. Warren promises to be a trust-buster - even as she tries to build a monopoly herself.</p><p>John McGinnis, a law professor at Northwestern, has this to say about the former Harvard law professor: On the one hand, he writes, Warren campaigns</p><p>as a relentless opponent of monopoly and a proponent of vigorous antitrust enforcement. She wants to break up big tech, restrain big banks and try to reduce market concentration throughout the economy. On the other hand, she wants to erect an unshakable monopoly in one of the largest sectors of the economy: health care. Ms. Warren plans to ultimately make private medical insurance illegal and favors a government monopoly to replace their competition.</p><p>Beyond McGinnis' observations, Warren also wants to push the corporate tax rate up to 35 percent (as do Sanders and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg). Those increased taxes would - according to a study by Erica York for the Tax Foundation - leave 413,000 Americans without work. The study also concludes such a move would reduce the long-run level of output by 2.1 percent and wages by 1.8 percent.</p><p>Candidates Joe Biden, Warren, and others, as noted by the Washington Free Beacon, have also pledged to reverse Trump's 2017 tax cuts and to \"hike corporate tax rates to as high as 35 percent to fund expensive government programs. Such policies will discourage corporate investment, thereby limiting growth in wages, employment, and productivity, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.\"</p><p>While it's difficult to accurately predict long-term effects, the Tax Foundation has also estimated that the Trump-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase long-run GDP by 1.7 percent, create 339,000 jobs, and raise wages by 1.5 percent.</p><p>Then there is the proposed major hike in the federal minimum wage, which would help some and hurt many. It is favored by Elizabeth Warren, among others. A bill to increase the minimum wage was passed in the summer of 2019, largely pushed by the Democrats in the House (though it didn't make it through the GOP-led Senate). As explained by Trey Kov\u00e1cs, a labor policy analyst with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, this is a \"poor anti-poverty tool, no matter how well-intentioned.\" He cited a recent Congressional Budget Office report showing that the consequences of a SI5 minimum wage would be millions of workers losing their jobs and families taking home less income. As Kov\u00e1cs noted:</p><p>Rather than help unskilled and inexperienced workers, a $15 minimum wage will cut off the first rung of the career ladder for many. By raising the minimum wage, businesses will choose to hire more productive employees. This leaves less productive workers - the target of minimum wage policies - out of a job and deprived of the opportunity to gain the skills necessary to get higher paid employment.</p><p>The CBO report, entitled \"The Effects on Employment and Family Income of Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage,\" also found that a hike in the minimum wage would over time even reduce the nation's output and \"reduce business income and raise prices as higher labor costs were absorbed by business owners and then passed on to consumers.\"</p><p>The late economist Murray Rothbard, a free-market advocate of the Austrian school, was typically more direct in his criticism on this topic, calling a minimum wage \"compulsory unemployment.\" The law in such a case, as Rothbard wrote in 1988, just says: \"It is illegal, and therefore criminal, for anyone to hire anyone else below the level of X dollars an hour.\" The minimum-wage law, he stressed, \"provides no jobs; it only outlaws them; and outlawed jobs are the inevitable result.\" This, remember, is what the Democrats are vowing to do if they take over Congress and the White House.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainstream media is doing its worst to pan or downplay the nation's economy under Trump. Some are unabashedly rooting for a recession. (The most egregious example may be that of Bill Maher, a comedian/political commentator/television host who has admitted, \"I'm hoping for it [a recession] because I think one way you get rid of Trump is to crash the economy. So please, bring on the recession.\")</p><p>Here are some mainstream pieces talking down the economy (as collected by the Media Research Center's \"Newsbusters\"): From the New York Times, \"How the Recession of 2020 Could Happen\"; from CNBC, \"Is there a recession coming? Keep an eye on these key indicators\"; and, from Vox, \"Why everybody's worried about a recession again\" and \"Recessions, and the fear that another one is just around the corner, explained.\"</p><p>Examples of media slanting and distortion - as long as they reflect poorly on Trump - are legion. Here's a couple more from Clifford Thies, a professor of economics and finance at Shenandoah University, writing for the Heartland Institute. This past fall, he commented about a survey of business economists that had just found that \"only 4 percent said they expected a recession to begin by the end of the year.\" But, as the professor commented, that is not</p><p>what the fake news reported. The Washington Post, for example, headlined \"3 out of 4 economists predict a U.S. recession by 2021.\" The fact that very few economists expect a recession in the near term was buried in articles or not reported at all.</p><p>The forecast of an imminent and even a disastrous recession has been continually pushed by the fake news since Trump's election. The day after that election, Paul Krugman, writing for the New York Times, said. AI Gorelike, \"we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.\" Yet here we are with an economy that has been growing continuously for the longest period in history.\"</p><p>Of course it is true that expansions don't last forever. And stock markets can go both down and up. But such ideological critics are like pessimists who burn their bridges before they get to them. And if their wishes could bum down our bridges, many would be part of the arson lobby.</p><p>You can still find good news in some quarters. As noted not long ago by Americans for Tax Reform, there are \"157 million Americans in the workforce and the labor force participation rate is at 63.3 percent, a stark contrast to the 40-year lows seen under the Obama administration.\"</p><p>These days, as noted by CBS News on November 27, some researchers have come up with a new metric (the Job Quality Index, or JQI) that purports to show that \"more and more jobs ... offer inadequate pay.\" Their metric plucks the suitable numerators and denominators to prove that there is \"a growing number of low-paying jobs relative to employment with above-average pay.\" The JQI \"will be updated and released on the same day the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases monthly jobs figures,\" said CBS News, citing one of its creators.</p><p>This phenomenon has reportedly been ongoing for three decades. Isn't it fortunate that the measurement was invented during the Trump years?</p><p>Truth seems to be so valuable that many people economize when using it. *</p><p>- WILLIAM P.

This was in the summer of 2016.</p><p>Now, the documents included draft court filing that provides insight into what Mueller may know about Stone's efforts to obtain information from WikiLeaks in 2016. Now, Corsi says that summer wasn't the only time that Stone told him to go to WikiLeaks and try to get the goods. He claims he spoke to Stone on October 7th, in the hours before the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape became public.</p><p>Stone wanted him to try to mitigate the fallout with some help from WikiLeaks.</p><p>JEROME CORSI, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR: We get to October 7, which was a very, very busy day from here in New York. And Roger calls me three times. We had three -- three times we have a discussion.</p><p>Now, my recollection is that Roger is saying, you know, Billy Budd is going to be dropped and Assange better get going. Why don't you get to your buddy Assange and tell him to start? Well, I didn't have any contact with Assange. But Roger going back to July and August may have, you know, may have led him on.</p><p>MURRAY: Stone denies Corsi's version of events, telling CNN, it is pure, unadulterated B.S.</p><p>Now, Corsi still insists he never had any contact with Assange, and Stone still says he never had any advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks document dumps. So, far neither men is facing charges. Corsi says he won't sign on to a plea agreement the special counsel has offered him. They want him to plead guilty to perjury but he says he never knowingly lied to investigators.</p><p>As for what's next, Corsi says he doesn't know, but he knows the special counsel's office is none too happy that he's gone on this publicity tour.</p><p>Back to you, guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: Sara Murray, thank you.</p><p>Democrats are warning President Trump that even dangling a pardon for Paul Manafort could lead to a charge of obstruction of justice. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says she is confident the president was involved in any wrongdoing and was not part of any campaign collusion. She was asked whether a pardon for Manafort still on the table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Given that the president said this morning that Robert Mueller is ruining people's lives, is he considering a pardon for Paul Manafort or for others who are prosecuted and have been prosecuted?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Rudy Giuliani is not ruling anything out.</p><p>[05:05:00] He tells CNN the president has been upset for weeks about what he considers the un-American, horrible treatment of Paul Manafort.</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump explaining why he is so skeptical of his own administration's report on the dire consequences of climate change. He tells the \"Washington Post\" this -- one of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water, and it's right now at a record clean.</p><p>For the record, the Yale environmental performance index ranks the U.S. 83rd in the world in air pollution, 29th in water and sanitation. The White House Press Secretary Sarah insists the federal government climate change study produced by more than 300 scientists and experts is not based in fact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: It's not data driven. We'd like to see something that is more data driven, that's based on modeling which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate. Again, our focus is making sure we have the safest, cleanest air and water. The president's going to do exactly that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: When asked about the deadly wildfires in California, the president once again claimed the problem could be solved by raking those California forests.</p><p>BRIGGS: The president blaming drops in the stock market and plant closings at General Motors on the Federal Reserve. Mr. Trump says he is not even a little bit happy with his pick for Fed chairman Jerome Powell, telling \"The Washington Post,\" quote: So I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed. I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because -- here's the key -- I have a gut. My gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.</p><p>ROMANS: Jerome Powell will speak at the New York Economic club today. We'll see if he avoids any confrontation with the president there --</p><p>BRIGGS: No gut references forthcoming from the Fed chair.</p><p>ROMANS: Maybe not.</p><p>All right. President Trump threatening to cut all General Motors subsidies after the automaker announced thousands of job cuts and the shuttering of five facilities in North America. The president tweeted Tuesday, quote, very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan, and Maryland. We are now looking at cutting all GM subsidies including for electric cars.</p><p>A person familiar with the matter told CNNGM is unaware of significant federal subsidies it is receiving beyond a $7,500 plug-in tax credit. And that doesn't go to GM. That goes to the consumer to help you buy an electric vehicle.</p><p>After the president's threat, GM released a statement saying it remains committed to, quote, maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the United States, pointing to more than $22 billion of investments in domestic operations since 2009. GM also said the restructuring announced Monday is aimed at supporting future growth such as driverless cars and electric vehicles and long-term success.</p><p>The company is hiring. They're hiring --not hiring as one analyst told me, not power train engineers anymore. It's software engineers and tech. That's what they're hiring.</p><p>BRIGGS: The evolution of the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith will keep her Senate seat, holding off a Democratic challenge in Mississippi. CNN projects Hyde-Smith will defeat Democrat Mike Espy in the Senate runoff election. The election centered largely on Hyde-Smith's comments evoking the dark history of the state's racism and slavery. She acknowledged it was indeed a difficult campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HYDE-SMITH: You can get brutalized. You can get beat up. That's kind of part of this business. We're putting it behind us. We can go forward, and we're not looking back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Hyde-Smith will now finish out the final two years of Thad Cochran's term. He retired from the Senate earlier this year. She'll have to run again in 2020 for a full six-year Senate term.</p><p>So, the Mississippi's race is the last Senate contest to be decided in the midterm. Come January, the Senate balance of power will look like this -- 53 Republicans, 47 Democrats, giving the GOP a net gain of two seats in the senate.</p><p>ROMANS: Meantime, the Democratic majority in the next House continues to grow. The party picked up another seat with Xochitl Torres Small beating Republican Yvette Herrell, in New Mexico's he second congressional district. That makes a net gain of 35 seats for the Democrats.</p><p>Can they reach 40, though? Just one house race left to call in California's district, where Democrat T.J. Cox has pulled ahead of Republican Congressman David Valadao by just over 400 votes in the latest tally. CNN and other news organizations had called the race for Valadao on election night. But CNN withdraw the projection as the count tightened.</p><p>So, at the moment, the balance of power in the House looks like this -- Democrats, 234 seats, Republicans, 200 seats. One seat undecided.</p><p>About the blue wave, call it a tidal wave really. Democrats made big gains in the 2018 midterms, picking up 39 seats in the House. In governor races, governor's races, Democrats had a net gain of seven while Republicans lost six. And in the state legislatures, Democrats gained at least 332 seats.</p><p>Perspective from our favorite pollster Harry Enten, before the election, 58 percent of the population had a GOP governor.</p><p>[05:10:01] After the election, 47 percent have a GOP governor.</p><p>BRIGGS: Later today, Democrats meet behind closed doors to decide whether Nancy Pelosi will be the next House speaker. By CNN's comment, 23 Democrats have committed to voting against Pelosi today or at least abstaining. Even so, she is flatly expected to win the vote.</p><p>But a public vote on the House floor on January 3rd remains filled with intrigue. Pelosi penning a letter to fellow Democrats asking for their support writing, history is in a hurry, and we need accelerate the pace of change in Congress. The public has entrusted us to save our democracy.</p><p>It begs the question, she says she'll be a transitional figure. Transitioning to whom and when, we have no idea.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>All right. Russia and Ukraine on the brink of war? Martial law kicks in this morning. We're going to go live to Kiev, next.</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump says he's waiting for a full report on Russia's most recent confrontation with Ukraine.</p><p>[05:15:02] He says depending on what it says, he may skip his scheduled meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin at that G20 Summit this week.</p><p>Just a few hours, martial law went into effect in 10 Ukrainian border provinces. Tension climbing in the region after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships in the Kerch Strait on Sunday. You see them ramming a Ukrainian tugboat.</p><p>This morning, more than a dozen Ukrainian sailors are still being held prisoner by Russia. Their confessions, maybe forced confessions, have been aired on Russian television.</p><p>Senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh joins us live from Ukraine.</p><p>Nick, what is the latest this morning?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, at this point, the Kremlin say they're making accommodations for the meeting despite Trump saying he might cancel it if he learns the full details -- he said was going to be a full report that he was supposed to hear last night. We don't know what that's resulted in. We know that he's been relatively muted in terms of criticizing what he called aggression, saying he wasn't happy about it, saying he wanted it straightened out.</p><p>But he did use the phrase, quote, either way, suggesting perhaps he could hold either side responsible for what happened in the Kerch Strait, the most brazen military-on-military confrontation we've seen so far. Normally, the Russian military has used proxies or disguises to some degree over the last four years while it's attacked Ukraine. But it's led to these days of escalating rhetoric despite Germany's Angela Merkel calling for de-escalation, we've not seen that.</p><p>And about four hours ago here in Ukraine, marshal law kicked into effect in ten regions. I got to tell you, there's no obvious, palpable sign being reported of what that actually means on the ground. There's been a bit of confusion, frankly, about exactly how this is going to be implemented. It's supposed to last 30 days. But even last night, Petrov Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, said he hadn't decided yet if part of martial law was to initially ban Russian citizens from entering Ukraine.</p><p>So, I think many are concerned about the great latitude for it to be interpreted different ways. The broader signal is how much does Moscow think from the relatively calm White House reception it can get away with -- Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: Indeed. Nick Paton Walsh for us in Kiev -- thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: A video released by the U.S. forest service shows a gender- reveal party that went horribly wrong, sparking a huge wildfire in southern Arizona.</p><p>That happened. In the video from last April, the target containing explosive Tannerite is hit by a high-powered rifle, exploding in blue powder to reveal Dennis Dickey and his wife were having a son. The blast ignited a fire that grew to some 47,000 acres, causing $8 million worth of damage. Dickey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, ordered to pay $100,000 in restitution up front, $500 a month for the next 20 years. Yet another reason not to have a gender-reveal party.</p><p>ROMANS: I never have been into the gender-reveal party. And the elaborate proms people ask for homecoming or prom with the super elaborate, I never --</p><p>BRIGGS: Glad we missed those waves indeed.</p><p>ROMANS: Dave, you want to go to the senior prom with me?</p><p>We don't usually cover table tennis, but there's a miracle shot you have to say. Coy Wire with more in this morning's \"Bleacher Report\".</p><p>[05:22:47] BRIGGS: All right. After a wild Saturday in college football, there's a shakeup in the playoff rankings.</p><p>Coy Wire here this morning with the \"Bleacher Report.\"</p><p>Hey, buddy.</p><p>COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dave.</p><p>You knew after number-10 Ohio State put up 62 points while smashing Michigan we'd see a shakeup in the rankings. Michigan is out of the top four. Georgia's replaced them.</p><p>But what we were watching for is who would be number five, Oklahoma or Ohio State, well, the playoff committee chose Oklahoma. That's significant because Georgia, big underdogs to Alabama in the sec title game this weekend.</p><p>So, if Oklahoma avenges their only loss in the season against number 14 Texas, they could be in. Not guaranteed, though, if the buckeyes now at six put on a show against number 21, Northwestern.</p><p>To hoops, Duke's loss in Maui dropped them to third in the college hoop rankings. But Zion Williamson and the boys were back to their high-flying selves last night. Zion with signature window slam, and then later on getting a alley hoop from Trey Jones, throwing down. Williamson had 25 points of the night. Duke wins it ACC Big Ten challenge match-up with Indiana 90-69.</p><p>A great honor for America's favorite hoops fan last night. Ninety- nine-year-old Loyola Chicago team chaplain Sister Jean made a name for herself during the miracle run to the final four last season, may have reward -- they have rewarded her with a ring to mark the occasion. Look at that smile. She's loving every moment of it.</p><p>I got a chance to meet her here in Atlanta during the Sweet 16. And I wanted to give her a ring, Dave and Christine. Marry me, Sister Jean. Good to see her still smiling.</p><p>All right. Finally, we don't often show Norwegian table tennis, but you have to see the once in a lifetime moment. Fifteen-year-old Christopher Chen tumbled to the ground on a return. Watch his paddle go up, lying on his back, right there. During the smash, he somehow blocks it.</p><p>The opponent seemed to be shocked. He amazingly somehow returns it and gets the point. But Chen would win in the end here. He wins this match three sets to love. They're calling this kid a cult hero.</p><p>[05:25:01] It's going absolutely viral. Had to share that with you this morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: I think you need some table tennis endorsements after a shot like that.</p><p>Coy Wire, thank you, my friend. Appreciate it.</p><p>WIRE: You're welcome.</p><p>BRIGGS: Romans, over to you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thanks, Dave.</p><p>New information about Robert Mueller's Russia case. What draft documents obtained by CNN say about Roger Stone and WikiLeaks.</p><p>And what President Trump says about guts, brains, and his high level of intelligence.</p><p>ROMANS: What does Robert Mueller know about Trump associate Roger Stone? New draft court document just obtained by CNN.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump spilling his guts, he will, to the \"Washington Post\" claiming his gut instincts are better than anyone's brain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: It's not data driven.

The sensible, Rhodes scholar, get-things-done mayor? Shared with Mayor <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg </nameText></person>of South Bend, Ind. The groundbreaking African-American candidate? Taken by Senator <person><nameText>Kamala Harris </nameText></person>of California.</p><p>The trip to Iowa was Mr. Booker\u2019s fourth of this campaign, evidence of the need for a strong showing in this first caucus state for any hope of a successful run through to South Carolina, where Mr. Booker is hoping for a victory. The entrance of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. into the race puts added pressure on Mr. Booker, especially competing for black voters \u2014 a major piece of the Democratic constituency in the South, and a group that has largely supported Mr. Biden in early polls.</p><p>On the trail, Mr. Booker is still campaigning with an ebullient style, recording selfie videos for voters and cracking <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/1132414330237014016/video/1\">self-deprecating \u201cdad jokes\u201d</url> at every stop. He even broke briefly into song during an interview, singing a few bars of \u201cMy City of Ruins\u201d by Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>But stuck in the low single digits in both national and early state polls, with a middling small-dollar fund-raising operation, he has started to sprinkle his unity-themed stump speech with some slight contrasts to other Democratic candidates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of those Democrats to say we need to start doing things that make people\u2019s lives better, because Democrats have done things that have made people\u2019s lives worse,\u201d Mr. Booker said at a house party in Newton, referring to the 1994 crime bill that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/politics/joe-bidens-role-in-90s-crime-law-could-haunt-any-presidential-bid.html\">Mr. Biden supported</url> while he was in the Senate, and which experts say contributed to mass incarceration.</p><p>And in calls for party solidarity, he offered a veiled critique of the hesitance of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>\u201cI hope that one of the questions you ask every single candidate is, if you\u2019re not the person, that you will commit to us that you will double down and support the person who is the nominee,\u201d Mr. Booker told the crowd in Newton. \u201cI saw that movie in 2016. I don\u2019t want to relive it.\u201d</p><p>Though he claims to try to avoid direct attacks on <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>\u2014 \u201cThe more attention we give him, the more oxygen he takes,\u201d Mr. Booker said \u2014 he has increased his criticisms, including taking a generational swipe at him as he looked ahead to the stakes of the climate change fight \u201c20 years from now, when I\u2019m the age of this current president.\u201d</p><p>To hear Mr. Booker describe it, he is \u201cpumped\u201d about his campaign\u2019s status, a slow-but-steady strategy espoused by the \u201cBrick by Brick\u201d slogan seen on signs at a town-hall-style event in Burlington on Saturday and on his campaign social media accounts.</p><p>\u201cI think if you look at the fundamentals of what has won past competitive Iowa primaries, we are doing extraordinarily well,\u201d Mr. Booker said in an interview. \u201cThe folks who know the politics in the state will unequivocally tell you we have the best organization on the ground.\u201d</p><p>While supporters in Iowa are confident in his message, some are perplexed at his stagnant polling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is because the message of love, and some people don\u2019t necessarily connect to that,\u201d said Rachelle Chase, 55, from Ottumwa, who has written two books about the Buxton coal mines, where Mr. Booker\u2019s great-great-grandparents worked. \u201cBut I think what appeals to me is that he\u2019s being authentic.\u201d</p><p>His focus on Iowa, with 30 events held as of Sunday and a staff of 50 in the state, and his pledge to unveil a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for rural America could help him build momentum.</p><p>\u201cThese are areas that have experienced a lot of difficult economic times,\u201d said Representative Dave Loebsack, who accompanied Mr. Booker on Saturday and represents an Iowa district Mr. Trump won in 2016. \u201cI think just listening to them and talking to them along economic lines is the most important thing candidates can do.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Booker made a splash nationally with his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/cory-booker-gun-control.html\">sweeping gun reform policy</url>, and earned kudos from many voters this weekend for his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/alabama-abortion-law-democrats-roe.html\">vocal response to the wave of new state bills restricting abortion</url>. And he teased thoughts on regulating social media companies, taking direct aim at criticisms that he has been too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\u201cI think that having better control of your own data and information is really important, and restricting the ability of platforms to be able to use your data for their profit,\u201d Mr. Booker said in an interview. \u201cThis is a space where we need to regulate, and having more transparency in that area is something we need to regulate.\u201d</p><p>His flatlining in the national polls has not helped an already struggling small-dollar fund-raising network; just 16 percent of his donations in the first three months of the year were $200 or less. Instead, Mr. Booker has kept a steady pace of high-dollar fund-raising events, and his campaign has roughly two dozen fund-raisers across six states already on the books for the next month.</p><p>Though he pledged in an interview to release the names of his bundlers \u2014 supporters who gather donations from friends and business associates \u2014 he said he currently would not allow pooled news media coverage of his fund-raisers as Mr. Biden has.</p><p>Mr. Booker did get one small-dollar boost on Saturday. While touring the flood damage in downtown Muscatine, Mr. Booker was stopped by two local farmers, Garry and Carolyn Reid. They farm 20,000 bushels of corn and soybeans per year, and said they had lost 85 cents per bushel as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war.</p><p>Since then, Mr. Reid said, the federal government deposited $200 into their bank account from an emergency fund. So Mr. Reid, 83, took $25 from that and donated it to Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much this encourages me,\u201d Mr. Booker said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Reid replied, tugging on his suspenders and offering a smirk, \u201cit\u2019s going to take more than that.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Senator Cory Booker </nameText></person>in Muscatine, Iowa, on Saturday.

I'm Scott Detrow. Throughout the spring and summer, we'll be taking you on the road to meet the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. These special episodes are a collaboration with New Hampshire Public Radio and Iowa Public Radio, which is why we have an extra special guest today, Casey McDermott, who covers politics for New Hampshire Public Radio. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hey, Casey. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASEY MCDERMOTT: Hey, Scott. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: How's it going? </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: It's good. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: So, Casey, you're from Pittsburgh, right? </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: I am from Pittsburgh. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But we are not here to continue our conversation about Pennsylvania regional convenience stores. We are here to talk about presidential candidates so... </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: We are not, but I would be remiss if I did not say that Sheetz is better than Wawa. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Casey and I were at a community center in Concord, N.H., to interview Democratic Senator Cory Booker. Standing in the back of a bright blue gymnasium, we watched him give his stump speech. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: This is an election where a lot of people rightfully say, oh, we got to - I need a candidate that can beat Donald Trump. Well, that's really wonderful, but that should not be your highest aspiration. That should be the floor, like, the entrance into it. </p><p>                (APPLAUSE)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: So he spoke for more than an hour. What jumped out to you? </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: I mean, I think we heard a lot of familiar themes that he's been talking about on the campaign trail. We heard a lot about his new gun policy. And I think we also heard a lot of him kind of carving out his brand as a candidate as someone who does not want to necessarily get out there and get in the mud quite as much as maybe some voters want their candidate to. So I think that's going to be interesting to watch, particularly as, you know, the field is pretty much taking shape right now. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Cory Booker jumped into the presidential race in February, running around the big idea of making love and unity and common purpose a central theme of his campaign and, if he wins, his presidency. He's been representing New Jersey in the Senate since 2013 and before that served two terms as mayor of Newark. Early on in Booker's mayoral career, he made a name for himself as one of the first politicians to use social media to reach out to voters and constituents. That's since become the norm, but running for president, Booker is still committed to connecting. He regularly gives out his phone number and makes a point of posing for pictures with every single voter who wants one and recording videos with them, too, to send to their friends and family. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)        </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Hey, Maureen (ph). It's Cory Booker. I have the honor to stand here with your progeny, your son, wishing you all the best. Happy Mother's Day a day late, and I hope - look forward to seeing you along the road. All the best. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: After that very last selfie, Senator Booker sat down with Casey and me in a room off to the side of that gym. </p><p>So we are here in the game room. We've got some archery target practice. We could play some volleyball as well. But I think here we might just have a conversation. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I'm just glad I'm not sitting in front of targets like you all are. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I guess that's what I do professionally, so it's nice to not have it done right now. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Well, welcome to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: It's very good to be with you both. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We're going to talk about some serious things. But, you know, it's a podcast, so I wanted to start with a very important topic. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yes. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: After Barack Obama, you would be the second president to be a known \"Star Trek\" fan. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: (Laughter). </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: So, you know, we're trying to get a sense of what kind of president you would be. So I feel like I need to start with what captain is your leadership style most similar to? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I am far more of a Picard man. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: OK. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: But I definitely have things I like about just about everyone. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Picard feels more comfortable delegating than some of the other candidates. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yeah, I really do like Picard's style. I really do. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: OK, so hold up. Can you just explain who you're talking about? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: (Laughter) Well, I know a lot of people are upset that I didn't say Sisko, by the way, because he had the best haircut. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: He did. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Although Picard's was pretty much like mine as well. These are incredible leaders in the \"Star Trek\" universe. And we should always - you should have it - it would be so cool if you started this podcast by saying engage. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We could talk about that for a while, but I think we'll shift to... </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I could go deep with - deep nerd with you. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I think we'd lose Casey very quickly, though. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: Unfortunately, I cannot go deep nerd in the same way that you guys might be able to. But I guess just to kind of switch gears, we're obviously out on the campaign trail. You've been officially running for president for a few months. But you I think it's probably fair to say have been thinking about it for longer than that. We're visiting New Hampshire. When did you decide that you were going to run for president? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I think it was a real process. And I - you know, there was somebody from New Hampshire that came down to talk about - to me about in 2017, a sort of a well-known political-involved person that was trying to make the case to me about why I should run and why I would win even in a crowded field. But that wasn't even persuasive. I think it was something that I was mulling over for quite some time. And it was more of a getting to a point where I realized that my reasons for not running were not worthy and that I should run. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: So what is it about you versus the 20-plus other candidates that are running right now that you think is compelling for the American people? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, I think there's two things that are distinctive about my purpose for running. One is what makes me distinct. I'm the only person in this race who was a chief executive of a state's largest city in the middle of a massive recession in a city that had a reputation for decades and decades of decay and decline. And we turned it around in pretty dramatic fashion. Now, it's going through its biggest economic development period from its school systems - 30% increases in graduation rates - to reforming the court systems to reforming the food deserts. I can go through a lot of that. But then that part of the resume plus being somebody who was a senator for last five or six years and actually got big things done, like our criminal justice reform bill that I led from the Democratic Senate side with Dick Durbin. But that's not it. That's just one thing - my unique resume as a chief executive and a senator who worked across the aisles to make things happen - but also it's just the theme. </p><p>You know, my whole career has been marked by taking on the toughest problems, bringing people together, creating uncommon coalitions to ultimately produce uncommon results, things that people said couldn't be done. And I really do think we're at a crossroads now in this country where there is a descent into tribalism. It's - tribalism to me is fear-based. It's us versus them. It's a zero-sum game politics. And that, to me, is going to lead us further and further into an intractable world where we don't get things done, and we divide this country more. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But when I hear you talk about that and talk about that revival of civic grace, I wonder how you use the presidency to do that. Because nobody talked about hope and unity more than Barack Obama. He literally sang \"Amazing Grace\" in 2015. And yet after eight years of President Obama, there was an anger and a division in this country that played out in the 2016 election. So what can you do from that position that he wasn't able to do? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I am literally sitting here as the fourth popularly elected African-American in the history of the Senate, and the rights and privileges I'm enjoying were fought by people who were told you're moving too fast, you can't get this done, it's impossible to pass civil rights legislation. The longest filibuster in Senate history is Strom Thurmond, who fought and was able to defeat attempts of passing civil rights legislation. But we did not give up. What we did do was have activists and leaders that were able to inspire the moral imagination of our country to get us to do things we didn't achieve before. You have just seen a president do the exact opposite. And quite effectively, he's using the highest office in this land to commit act after act of moral vandalism to do things to divide, demean and degrade us. And he is doing great in the politics of pitting Americans against each other. </p><p>And so the flip side of that is I believe that the right leaders - plural - because I hope done are the days that we think some savior is going to come in and be the sole purveyor of hope and possibility. What we need is a president that trusts the American people, that works with them and does things to revive those ideals I talked about but, more than that, to use his creativity from their office like I did when I was mayor when I had a nation that had looked at Newark, N.J., as a place you don't go to - and now our population is growing for the first time in 60 years - that you don't invest in because it's decaying, and we turned that perception around. So I will bring a creativity to the office, a - actions that use not just the official powers of the presidency but ways that you inspire the moral imagination in this country as past presidents did to do things people said couldn't be done, like putting someone on the moon. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We then turned to policy. Booker has just come out with a pretty big gun control platform. Among a lot of other things, he wants to require a national licensing system for buying guns. Casey asked him about how some of those new restrictions would work. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: That plan includes a lot of different components, but one of them would be to incentivize states to pass what are called extreme risk protective orders or sometimes red flag laws. That's something that we've heard politicians in New Hampshire look at. But one of the things that's come up here is people have raises concerns about how do you balance due process when you put together that kind of a policy? So what do you think about how you would approach that? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, I want to say that a lot of these policies are really important that we get them done. And, again, I'm glad that you gave some nod to the urgency of the moment. But I think most Americans don't realize that we live in a country where in the last 50 years we had more people die from gun violence than every single war in our country's history combined from the Revolutionary War to present. There is a grievous urgency to this that when - one of - my plan is based on not just the personal experience as the only person in this election, I think, the only person in the Senate I think that has had shootings in their neighborhood, shootings on their block. There is a personal urgency to this, but the plan itself is actually based on evidence-based things that we know work. </p><p>And so when it comes to red flag laws, to me, if we can't find a way to get the details right and surrender on the whole plan because we can't get the details right, then we're not going to solve the problem of folks getting their hands on guns that should not have them. And so we can - I often hear people wanted to quibble on a lot of the details. I wanted - but we should at least endorse the policy and work on getting it right through the legislative process. And so I imagine it - you'd need to balance due process. I'm all for that, but you cannot have a society where someone who is showing sign after sign of distress, sign after sign of imminent danger to themselves, can go into a gun shop and pass a background check and get a weapon. That's what I'm trying to get at, and I know we can get there. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: So are there any, like, specific provisions that you think would be really important to have in that kind of a policy? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yeah. There's opportunities for judicial review. There should be a process put forward that has to - you have to go through. I think it should involve law enforcement. I think it should be temporal. In other words, you don't permanently lose your gun rights. There should be opportunities for appeal. A lot of the substance that we've spelled out in general due process should apply to this. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We put out a request for questions from listeners, and we got a ton of questions about climate change - probably doesn't surprise you. You called it an existential crisis a few minutes ago. Out there, you were talking about a lot of different ways to deal with this - research and incentivizing green trends, fuel efficiency, things like that. But a central part of that Green New Deal framework that you've endorsed is, over the course of a decade, over the course of the coming decades, totally changing America's energy economy, the way we produce energy, the way we consume energy. It's a huge thing to do. A lot of candidates say it's just like the moonshot. But I'm curious - how do you specifically get there? Is it a carbon tax? Is it cap in trade? Is it mandating energy sources? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, again, it seems like the Green New Deal has done a lot in terms of just inspiring people about what should be possible, and this urgency that we need to move boldly is one of the reasons why I endorsed it. There is an urgency for us to think bigger, and taking our transportation sector and moving it towards electrification is something that will happen, but we need to be doing it a lot quicker. And so there are a lot of things we know have to happen, but creating a sense of urgency and having an aggressive plan in doing it I think that's something we all should be endorsing. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But in terms of that central piece - because at some point, the government is going to have to mandate some sort of large-scale change in power plants. Do you have a sense of what the best way to do that is? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, there's - you've mentioned some of them in your question to me. I mean, we have to start understanding that carbon is a pollutant. And we can't let people externalize the cost of their business onto the rest of society and not having some way of accounting for that. And so there's a whole menu of things that we can do, a lot of things that aren't in the Green New Deal, to begin to move us more urgently. We need a commander in chief in this sense that's going to drive us towards those solutions and then understand that we only produce 14% of the problem. And right now, the coal plants that are being opened in places like China and India are significant and staggering when we think about this problem in the larger global context. And that means that we're going to have to play a role internationally as well, using the levers we have from foreign aid to diplomacy to treaties to make sure that we are helping the entire planet move towards a lot of the innovations that we're going to embrace if I'm president of the United States. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: I want to just bring it back to another issue that has been pretty hot button in New Hampshire, especially in the last few weeks, and that's family medical leave policy. We've had some dueling proposals from Republicans and Democrats, and it's really sparked a big debate about how do you actually go about getting this kind of a policy passed? And I guess just to - from, like, a big-picture standpoint, do you think that this is something that the federal government should be taking the lead on as opposed to kind of a patchwork of state approaches? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yeah. This - we should have paid family leave. We're the only nation - only industrialized nation that just does not have paid family leave. And it's stunning to me. What we do for children in this country even before they get to school - we don't have what I would call universal prenatal care, with too many of our children being born low birth rate or even stillbirths. We're leading the planet Earth in that. We're not investing in universal preschool, affordable child care, and we're not investing in paid family leave. And living in a low-income community, I see the torture so many parents have to go through when they're working two jobs, trying to balance shifts and then have to make that terrible decision about going to the hospital emergency room or staying at work to get a paycheck that they desperately need to keep a roof over their kid's head. So this is, to me, not even debatable. </p><p>We need to join the rest of the developed world and have a paid family leave plan. Now, to pay for it, I actually think there's creative solutions that involve the states and the federal government working hand to hand, like we do with Medicare and Medicaid, is making sure that we're finding joint ways to cover the cost. But ultimately, this is what I know - as a former mayor, I used to always say if you look at a balance sheet analysis, doing the right thing is usually actually doing the cost-efficient thing as well. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: So in terms of - you kind of floated the outline of a plan there, but do you have any thoughts on whether it should be, you know, mandatory, should it be voluntary or the amount of time that maybe people should be able to take off? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Again, I think that the - number one, we should have a system that is universal for everyone, that every single parent, should the issue arise, has the opportunity to take paid family leave. Again, there are details in this that are worth discussing when we get to the legislative drafting point, like does that start immediately on day one of your job? Or should there be a ramp-up period? These are things that are really important, but I don't want to obscure and start - have people trying to tear down because of the small details and miss the larger urgency of the policy plan, which is I believe we can fund it through state and federal partnerships and that it should be something that's universally applied. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: You've been getting a lot of questions from interviewers and from voters like today about social media and the best way that the federal government should regulate it. And, you know, I think a lot of people in America are still adjusting to this governing-by-tweet style of President Trump. But you were really the first politician in a much different way to embrace Twitter and to use it to create community, to reach out to people. So I'm wondering, as you sit here in 2019 and you probably might have a different answer than you did at the beginning of your mayoral career, do you think that social media has done more harm or good? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: So first of all, I'm glad that you recognize that we were really early innovators on the platform, and we realized we can go from, you know, e-government, which people talked about, to we government. And we really empowered our constituents in Newark not just to drive by a traffic light out but to actually take a picture of it and tweet your mayor. And we actually used it as an efficiency tool and could start driving down the amount of time it took to fix a pothole from - God, when I got to Newark, it was maybe weeks, if not months to fix a pothole to literally hours. And I was very proud of how we created more community, as you said, bonds that were tighter where more people were taking responsibility for their neighborhoods. And in that sense, social media created constructive social environments. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But there's so much downside. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: So much downside. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I mean, white nationalism has been reinvigorated because of social media. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yeah, absolutely. Not just white nationalism - I'm worried about privacy issues. I'm worried about Russian attacks. They - literally, if you look at what their insidious aims are - to divide this country, to make us hate each other, not to - make us not to trust media - but even this - one's self-esteem. I've seen studies for young kids, what it's doing to their own views of themselves, the views of their own worth. And so we need to start having a far more determined conversation about the upside and the downside and learn how to mitigate these issues that are real. And government does have a role. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And is that through the Department of Justice or through something like the SEC, treating it as a regulated business? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, I think it's a lot of the above. I mean, we've - I think that we've seen, with the erosion of net neutrality, just all the different people that have touches upon this marketplace. And so, yeah, I do think it's the DOJ, and I do think that this problem we've had with corporate consolidation - we need to start taking antitrust law seriously. I do think it's the FTC as well. There's a lot of ways that we have to approach this problem, but we right now have a president, an administration that seems to not have an approach and not recognize that this is a problem, whether it's Russian interference or the privacy we all have. We have things we haven't even thought through. Like, what happens when - if Uber wants to start using our ride information, and people who've gone to everywhere from abortion clinics to doctor's visits - you name it - things that to me are chilling if we don't start getting into this space and doing thoughtful regulation. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: OK. We're going to take a quick break. Back soon with more from our interview with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, including what he can't let go of this week. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And we're back. Over the next few months, the NPR POLITICS PODCAST, New Hampshire Public Radio and Iowa Public Radio are going to be interviewing a lot of the presidential candidates and bringing you those conversations. One of our goals is to give you a sense of who these people really are. So talking to Cory Booker, NHPR's Casey McDermott and I try to get the senator to be more personal. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: So you like to tell a lot of stories on the campaign trail, and there's a lot that maybe people who've been following your visits have heard maybe one or two or even three times. But I'm wondering if there's anything that you don't talk a lot about on the campaign trail that, you know, people should know about you. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, I'm a big Brene Brown fan and this idea that making yourself vulnerable is actually not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. And even in my book, the best compliment I got from people that were reading \"United\" was this doesn't seem like a politician's book. You're talking a lot about how you are a jerk here or how you fell down and made a mistake here. And I think that sharing in that way - unlike Donald Trump who campaigned saying he was perfect and only he could solve these problems - I think that it's important to let people know who you are, where you've stumble, where you've failed and what you learned and what you're going to apply. And so I try to be very open with folks and try to engage in that because I do think campaigns, in and of themselves, are important processes in our country for effecting the national conversation, for changing the energy in our society because you all are putting us out there all the time. </p><p>I want to make sure, as my mom says, tomorrow's not promised to me; do everything you can today. And so the frequency of my town halls is - one reporter came up to me in South Carolina and literally took off his press credentials and said I thought I was going to come in here - just a policy talk, but this was more of a revival. Well, I'm a guy - as you've heard already, I think we need more of a revival of the best of who we are, not - especially when we've seen so much toxic politics that are I think making our society and our dialogue worse, not better. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: What's a moment in your life where you really failed, and what did you learn from it? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: You know, the - a very painful moment of failure was when I first got elected to be mayor of the city in Newark. I was then living in these high-rise public housing projects. And I was coming home leading into the election, and there were guys that I'd watch grow up from kids to now young high schoolers, and they hung out in my lobby. I got to know them. I know their families and everything. And one of them, Hassan Washington, was, like, the leader of the crew there who was this incredible young man - reminded me of my dad. They were so similar - both born poor, both born in a segregated environment, both being raised by their grandmother for a little while, and he had the same spark as my dad. And one day, I came home and I smelled marijuana in the lobby. And every one of us sitting here who went to college knows that we have different marijuana laws for different people. Well, the law says it's the same, but people at Stanford smoking pot don't have anything to fear compared to what people in the inner city that do that. And so I knew it was a crisis, and I intervened, and I said, guys, let's get out of this lobby. Let's go do some things. I made the mistake of letting them choose the movie, which the first one we saw was \"Saw.\" I thought it was home improvement, but it was awful (laughter). But I got busy. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Yeah. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: When I got elected, and now I'm mayor-elect, I had death threats, and they surrounded me with security so there were now cops in the lobby in the projects. And, you know, I don't care who you are, from the suburbs to the cities, you don't want to hang out where there are police, so I lost track of them. But I was the big job. I was going to save all Newark's children - yada, yada, yada. Well, in the first days in office, I got called to a scene of a murder. And I was showing up to talk to people that we were going to change the violence rates in Newark. And there was a body covered - dead - and another one being loaded and racing off to the hospital. And I shamefully tell you I'd barely acknowledged the humanity - kill on the sidewalk. I was just ministering to the living and talking about my plans. But when I get home that night to steal a couple hours of sleep, I go to my - and then BlackBerry and go through all the reports and the data for the day, and I see that the - murder report, and I look at it. And then I get chills because the name on the report is Hassan Washington. </p><p>And for me, it was the worst gut punch I had taken in my life because my dad was Hassan. And when my dad was growing up, lots of people kept him from falling in the cracks. His grandmother couldn't take care of him. They brought him into their house. They took a collection to change our family's destiny and send him off to college. And God had put this kid right in front of me and it - I'll never forget his funeral, which is the perversion that happens in cities like mine all the time - of parents burying children. And we were all packed together there, crying and holding on to each other. And all I kept thinking is, here we all are gathered for his death. But where were we for his life? </p><p>And so for me, the lesson for that is life is - positions and titles come and go. All of us sitting here are going to have lots of different jobs. But I've just learned that the biggest thing you can do in any day still will most likely be a small act of kindness, decency and love. And even - I'm a presidential candidate right now, I'm staying in touch with the mentees and the young guys I've been working with in my town. And as much as this - my political life is about the policies I'm pursuing, to me, the drive has still got to be about human connection, human decency, being there for each other no matter what your title is, no matter what your job is and showing up for each other. And it's something I will never forget. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: This is one of several intense, personal stories that Booker regularly tells voters as he runs for president. He's responded to shootings like this by trying to connect to as many constituents as he can. But that's easier when you're a mayor than when you're a senator, and it's even harder to do on the national level. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: So as I understand it, you like to text with people that you meet on the campaign trail... </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Yes. </p><p>CASEY MCDERMOTT: ...Or just out in the community. And I'm just wondering, you know, would there be a way for people to text a President Cory Booker in the White House? </p><p>CORY BOOKER: I - from the time I was first campaigning in 1998 for city council, I would give myself - then it was my home phone. I still remember the number actually - out to people 'cause people are really respectful, ultimately. And I just found it just a very good way to govern. </p><p>And when I was mayor of the city of Newark, we, as you said, got a national reputation. I was, like, tweet me if there's an issue. And if it was late at night and somebody said, I'm stopped on the side of road, had an accident and the cops still haven't showed up yet, I'd get up out of my bed and go. </p><p>You can trust that as president of the United States, I'm going to try to reinvent a lot of the norms of the presidency - to be far more engaged, far more present, to use a lot of the tools and technology, not to demean and degrade and divide like, I think, this president does on a regular basis but to connect, to affirm, not to demean but to redeem. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Senator, the last question for you is the way that we end our podcast every week with one thing we just can't stop thinking about - politics or otherwise; the thing that we just can't let go. What can't you let go right now? What's kicking around in your head? It could be serious, could be the opposite of serious. Just what are you thinking about as you drive from event to event, when you're not posting live videos on Instagram about that drive? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>CORY BOOKER: So the problem is I'm reading David Brooks' book right now, so I - it's all up in my head. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Yeah. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: And I - again, tomorrow's not promised, so I'm just trying to figure out better ways to talk about what I think is that crisis in our country, and it is a moral crisis right now. I think the poverty that most worries me is the poverty of empathy, the poverty of compassion because you need that to do something else. And so I really do challenge myself every day. Like, how can I talk about this in a way that touches and inspires other people to be more aware? As I joked inside - you heard me earlier when I said, you know, I walk into a town hall in Iowa and some guy puts his arm around me, thinking he's going to have a kind of a bro moment. He was, like, I want you to punch Donald Trump in the face. And I joked with him back. I said, dude, that's a felony (laughter). </p><p>And I don't - I came from parents who taught me - I mean, the stories I learned as a kid, hearing these lessons of love. Like, that black folks and white folks, Christians and Jews - like, the stories - firsthand stories I heard about the affirmation of human connection of what mattered, that we weren't a society that confused wealth with worth, celebrity with significance. And so I think that what we need in this country right now is that. And I'm trying to read books on this campaign trail of people that are - from both sides of the aisle - Brooks is a Republican - that speak to that American spirit that has enabled us to go to the moon, to beat the Nazis, to beat Jim Crow, to, at that point, do the biggest infrastructure plan and project in the Eisenhower era that we'd ever done that united this country, quite literally, by roads and bridges. That's sort of my mission, and I'm trying to figure out a better way to be the best possible exponent of those ideals on the trail. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: My Can't Let It Go for this week is that I met a Muppet. Yours is a little more lofty. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, as you put it, you were one of 2,020 Democrats running for president. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: (Laughter). </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Thanks so much for talking with the NPR POLITICS PODCAST and New Hampshire Public Radio. </p><p>CORY BOOKER: Thank you both for having me. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: That's the first of several conversations that we'll be having over the next few months with many of the 22 and counting candidates for president. Next week, Tamara Keith and Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters are interviewing South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. In the meantime, we'll be back in your feed soon with our regular podcast as soon as there's news to talk about. Thanks so much to Casey McDermott and everyone else at New Hampshire Public Radio.

Corzine </nameText></person>is a 6-foot-2 bear of a man who has spent decades roaming expansive halls of power. He held the top job at the old Goldman Sachs office tower, a concrete pinnacle of American capitalism. And after that, he had the run of the governor's mansion in New Jersey -- all 18,000 square feet of it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On a recent afternoon, however, he squeezed into a 100-square-foot office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan -- no nameplate on the door -- where a pair of Bloomberg terminals consumed much of the space. His eyes fixed on one, Mr. Corzine scribbled notes about his trades on a yellow legal pad as a computer chimed an imitation closing bell. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the final seconds of trading, Mr. Corzine watched as a tiny sliver of his day's profits slipped away, prompting him to utter a profanity or two and grumble about not ending the afternoon on more of ''a high note.''</p><p>  It has been years since the last major high note in Mr. Corzine's career. In 2011, he faced the ignominy that came with the collapse of the brokerage firm he ran, MF Global, when about $1 billion of customer money temporarily went missing. It ranked as one of the largest Wall Street bankruptcies since Lehman Brothers'.</p><p>  Now, here in his cramped office, Mr. Corzine is plotting his next and possibly final act: starting a hedge fund. And not just any hedge fund, but one designed to take advantage of the turmoil in the Trump era.</p><p>  Wall Street's wheel of fortune has spun plenty of comeback stories over the years, from Michael Milken to Henry Blodget. This will be the third spin of the wheel for Mr. Corzine, who won a United States Senate seat after being maneuvered out of Goldman, and who took the reins of MF Global after losing the New Jersey governorship to <person><nameText>Chris Christie.</nameText></person></p><p>  If the third time's the charm, few comebacks will have had the operatic extremes of Mr. Corzine's past decade. It is a period that includes not only MF Global's demise but also his own near-death experience in a car accident and, later, the death of his youngest son.</p><p>  In his first interview since the MF Global meltdown began, Mr. Corzine detailed his plans for a new hedge fund, saying that he will seek to anticipate what often seems unpredictable: how the Trump administration and other world leaders will enact policy and, in turn, move markets.</p><p>  One of his Trump trades, for example, is designed to pay off in the event of a broad decline in the stock market, not unlike what happened Wednesday when shares swooned on Trump-related worries. On the bullish side, he hopes to ride a wave of a corporate-tax overhaul while trading in big tech, banking and industrial companies poised to gain from a policy shift.</p><p>  After straddling the worlds of Washington and Wall Street for decades, Mr. Corzine, a liberal Democrat with a capitalist streak, argues that he is well suited for this strategy. He has mulled a hedge fund for years, ambitions first reported by The Times in 2012, and he believes that the populist movements sweeping the Western world (not just Trump, but ''Brexit'') provide an opening.</p><p>  ''I think I can read between the lines more than a lot of people can on these issues,'' he said last month, on the eve of a trip to raise money for his fund with wealthy investors.</p><p>  In the first few weeks of marketing, Mr. Corzine has secured commitments and indications of interest in the tens of millions of dollars, according to a colleague who is helping him reach an initial goal of roughly $150 million. At a time when the stars of the hedge fund world can raise billions of dollars in a matter of weeks, Mr. Corzine's financial ambition is modest. The real test will come, he said, if after several months the fund can demonstrate healthy returns and expand to a broader base of investors.</p><p>  Wearing his trademark sweater and beard, Mr. Corzine, now 70, added, ''And, you know, I am competitive.''</p><p>  That competitive streak may stoke a romance with risk that has trailed Mr. Corzine's career from Wall Street to Washington (and Trenton) and back again. A friend who works on Wall Street acknowledged that Mr. Corzine, even when placing a prudent bet, sometimes has trouble taking his foot off the gas -- Exhibit A being MF Global.</p><p>  During interviews, Mr. Corzine discussed new details about the final days of MF Global, including an interaction with Carl C. Icahn, as well as his regrets over not booking a big loss up front, a decision that came back to bite the firm. Still, he defended his tenure at MF Global. He noted that, despite a federal investigation, there was no evidence he misused the $1 billion in missing customer money, which was ultimately found and returned. This year, he reached a civil settlement over accusations that he failed to supervise employees who handled the money.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine also spoke publicly for the first time about the death of his son Jeffrey, who was by his side during his time at MF Global and who invested his own money in the firm. Jeffrey's death in 2014 led Mr. Corzine to name the hedge fund JDC/JSC Opportunity Fund, using his son's initials and his own as he resumes his trading career.</p><p>  ''He is a legendary trader who has spent his life deeply interested and involved in markets,'' Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who worked with Mr. Corzine atop Goldman in the late 1990s, said in an interview.</p><p>  While MF Global investors might view some of Mr. Corzine's trades as dangerous, his friends credit his risk-taking with scoring some of his life's surprising victories: walking onto the basketball team at the University of Illinois having come from a tiny farming town, winning a Senate seat when he had never held even local office, and then voting against the Iraq war long before public opinion was on his side.</p><p>  Sharon Elghanayan, his wife and a psychotherapist, put it this way: ''It's not risk to him. It's conviction.''</p><p>  Back in the Spotlight</p><p>  Soon after MF Global imploded in the fall of 2011, Mr. Corzine was walking down Fifth Avenue when, he said, a stranger unleashed an expletive-filled assault. These days, venturing outside is no longer perilous.</p><p>  Strangers greet him on the street as ''Governor.'' And most Sundays, Mr. Corzine and Ms. Elghanayan walk to the 3 Guys Restaurant on the Upper East Side to eat among the financial upper crust. Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman executive who is now a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor, are said to frequent the restaurant, where, for the price of a $20 Reuben and fries, Wall Street titans can see and be seen.</p><p>  Now, Mr. Corzine is being seen on a much bigger stage. On Friday, he appeared at the SALT Conference in Las Vegas, the premier hedge fund schmooze-fest, where he joined Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ben Bernanke and the singer Jewel, as well as hundreds of fund managers and reporters.</p><p>  That appearance coincides with Mr. Corzine's fund-raising tour. And while it's early days yet, there are signs his pitch is resonating with some investors.</p><p>  After securing commitments from family and friends, he recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, where he met with a number of wealthy investors. He also plans to visit Latin America and Hong Kong.</p><p>  When the fund-raising concludes, Mr. Corzine hopes to have collected just shy of $150 million, the amount at which private funds must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That sum will include several million dollars of his own money.</p><p>  In addition to trading, Mr. Corzine will help clients decipher the inner workings of Washington, particularly for investors feeling bewildered in the age of Trump. Sure, he has not worked in Washington in a dozen years. But he says he has a social network encompassing Goldmanites (Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Cohn, for example) and a younger crew of Wall Street insiders whom he recruited to MF Global, including Omeed Malik, a Bank of America executive who oversees a unit that helps hedge funds open their doors.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine is joining the business at a shaky time. Some major investment firms, including Fortress Investment Group, have shut down funds, while another notable trip-up came from Marc Mezvinsky, Hillary Clinton's son-in-law, who closed his fund last year after a failed bet on an economic revival in Greece.</p><p>  But others are raking in money, and Mr. Corzine argues that this moment provides him a leg up. He can interpret a poll better than your average trader, he said, and scan the news media knowing ''which reporters are full of'' it, he added, using an expletive.</p><p>  If all goes according to plan, Mr. Corzine expects to open his fund in the fall. He hopes to hire a half-dozen employees, up from the current two: Sean Roberts, a trader and investment professional he first hired at MF Global, and Nancy Dunlap, his longtime lawyer.</p><p>  The fund will hire at least one more lawyer, he said, because ''I can't afford a reputational issue.''</p><p>  Growing Up With Risk</p><p>  Mr. Corzine said he was not stamped as a risk-taker at Goldman Sachs or on Capitol Hill. He traces the trait much earlier, to his hometown, Willey Station, Ill., population 40, where every year his father would plant corn and soybeans hoping they would sprout and praying that the weather would not destroy them.</p><p>  ''I grew up with risk,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p><p>  Yet his father avoided financial risk, refusing to ever use a credit card, scarred by his own parents losing a fortune in the Great Depression. And his father stuck to farming, frustrating a young Mr. Corzine, who had hoped his father would venture into local politics.</p><p>  Years later, after a stint in the Marine Corps Reserves and graduation from the University of Chicago's business school, Mr. Corzine learned risk-taking for himself Wall Street-style.</p><p>  In 1976, Goldman hired him for an entry-level job. Within a few years, he took over the government bond trading division and ascended to the top of Goldman in 1994, as senior partner. He soon set the firm on a path to becoming a public company.</p><p>  That process unfolded in fits and starts as Mr. Corzine faced opposition from some partners. He won overwhelmingly, but after a number of other disagreements with fellow managers, what happened next was cutthroat even by Wall Street standards. He returned from a family ski trip to learn that he had been ousted.</p><p>  The 2011 book ''Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World'' details how Mr. Corzine, without telling Mr. Paulson or other top executives, met once with the chief executive of Mellon Bank about a potential merger, a move that aggravated tensions and may have contributed to his ouster. Mr. Paulson, who declined to discuss the events surrounding Mr. Corzine's departure, then took over the firm.</p><p>  In an interview, Mr. Corzine acknowledged meeting the Mellon bank chief, and said he had a duty to explore other options before the I.P.O. He paused, and then added: ''Maybe they're right. Maybe I should have told people I was going to do that.''</p><p>  It did not take long to move on. Within months, he was running in New Jersey for the United States Senate.</p><p>  After dropping about $60 million of his own money on the race -- along with some cash from Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, now Mr. Trump's son-in-law -- Mr. Corzine cruised to victory.</p><p>  In the Senate, he helped lead an effort to provide a tax holiday for the families of 9/11 victims, and was one of only 23 senators to vote against the Iraq war. During that period, he also sought a divorce from his wife of 33 years, whom he met in the second grade.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine was dating a New Jersey union leader at the time, and although the relationship ended, the romance raised eyebrows as his ambitions were expanding: Mr. Corzine planned a run for New Jersey governor.</p><p>  He prevailed at the polls, but a little over a year later, he nearly died. Rushing to a meeting, Mr. Corzine's driver was traveling 91 miles an hour when he lost control of the sport utility vehicle. Mr. Corzine, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was induced into a coma.</p><p>  ''It happened like this,'' Mr. Corzine recalled, snapping his finger.</p><p>  A month after waking up, he was back working on his liberal agenda. Mr. Corzine eventually won early childhood education for underprivileged children. He established paid family leave. And he abolished the death penalty, the first state in a generation to do so.</p><p>  Even in deep blue New Jersey, those changes were not enough to secure him a second term. As he has committed to memory, ''I lost by 3.61'' points.</p><p>  'Single Greatest Mistake'</p><p>  Ms. Elghanayan advised Mr. Corzine to ''wait, don't do anything'' after the campaign loss. It was advice that Mr. Corzine declined to follow.</p><p>  In an interview, he said he had chosen between offers at the prominent hedge fund D. E. Shaw and the second-tier brokerage firm MF Global. D. E. Shaw offered more money and prestige. MF Global offered the chairman and chief executive roles. He chose MF Global.</p><p>  By the time he arrived, the firm had recorded three consecutive years of losses, and Mr. Corzine concluded that a bolder approach was needed. He became one of the firm's most profitable traders of its own money, and convened a weekly meeting with other traders to solicit ''best ideas.''</p><p>  One idea was to buy European government debt at a time when some countries with the euro currency were experiencing a crisis, a trade that was well underway before Mr. Corzine arrived. He saw an opportunity to expand the firm's use of a technique that would produce steady returns from the trade while the European Union effectively pledged to backstop the eurozone sovereign debt. Just in case, Mr. Corzine had an insurance policy, taking a short position against the euro, a fact he now wishes he had trumpeted louder to investors.</p><p>  The investment was paying off, helping the firm return to profitability. But Mr. Corzine's strategy had its critics. One of MF Global's risk officers questioned the trade, and so did regulators.</p><p>  ''History has proven that the trade was entirely correct,'' said David Gelber, an MF Global board member who until now had not spoken publicly about the firm's collapse. ''But I think we were too introverted. We knew it to be safe, but we didn't appreciate the reaction of the outside world to the size of these positions.''</p><p>  Investors were on edge.</p><p>  In October 2011, Mr. Corzine said, the firm's auditors forced it to write down the value of an unrelated future tax benefit. That caused a huge quarterly loss, an oft-ignored explanation for the firm's decline. Amid confusion at the time, investors generally conflated that loss with the eurozone sovereign debt trade.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine called his decision not to take the write-down earlier his ''single greatest mistake'' at the firm.</p><p>  But the final blow arguably came that same week in late October from the rating agencies, when Moody's cut its assessments of MF Global twice in a matter of days, citing the European trade and ''increased risk appetite.'' This prompted a run on the firm.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine argued that Moody's was well aware of the European trade. But he also acknowledged that he had overlooked and failed to communicate with the analyst Moody's had recently assigned to MF Global, leading him to wonder now whether ''that's one of my mistakes.''</p><p>  Those next few days, Mr. Corzine worked through each night and slept on his office floor. Sensing things were improving, he went home to shower in the predawn hours of Oct. 28 when the phone rang with bad news: The firm had overdrawn a JPMorgan Chase bank account.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine returned to work and phoned a back-office employee who handled wire transfers. He told her to meet JPMorgan's demands, declaring that it was ''the most important thing'' to do because otherwise the bank would halt business with MF Global, court records show.</p><p>  She complied. But in doing so, she transferred customer money to JPMorgan, not MF Global's own money, violating a cardinal rule of the brokerage industry. It was one of several wire transfers to a bank or clearinghouse that included customer money.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine, who later hired the defense attorney Andrew Levander, said he was unaware that the money belonged to customers, citing an email he received at the time indicating that it was the firm's.</p><p>  As that problem unfolded, Mr. Corzine had another pressing assignment: selling the firm and its various holdings.</p><p>  By Oct. 30, Interactive Brokers was planning to buy the firm, while Mr. Corzine met with Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, who was interested in the euro positions. Mr. Icahn promised to make a decision by morning, Mr. Corzine recalled.</p><p>  Both deals fell apart (investors who later bought the euro positions reaped a huge profit) when the firm discovered a roughly $1 billion shortfall in its customers' assets. MF Global went out of business.</p><p>  ''The MF Global episode provided a very stark example of a failure to supervise a broker dealer,'' said Christopher Whalen, the chairman of Whalen Global Advisors and a longtime Wall Street analyst. ''Wall Street is filled with examples of people who are really smart and have great skills as bankers and traders but maybe are not the right people to run an enterprise.''</p><p>   The Trump Trade</p><p>  When Mr. Corzine turned 70 on New Year's Day, he took his children and grandchildren to the Caribbean for a celebration. The birthday was not the only significant event that week.</p><p>  Days later, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced that Mr. Corzine had agreed to pay $5 million to settle accusations that he had failed to supervise MF Global. A criminal investigation fizzled years earlier, and the customer money was long since recovered and returned.</p><p>  With all of that behind him, Mr. Corzine was free to start a hedge fund, a business that need not operate under the gaze of public shareholders or rating agencies.</p><p>  Although the settlement imposed a lifetime prohibition from registering with the trading commission -- effectively preventing his fund from trading more than a small amount of other people's money in the futures industry -- stocks, bonds and most currencies are fair game. And that could leave plenty of room, he says, for the Trump trade.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine would hardly be the only hedge fund manager seizing the moment in Washington. Some expect a correction in the stock market as investors come to terms with turmoil in the White House.</p><p>  Mr. Corzine worries that the administration will make ''a serious foreign policy mistake,'' he said, which would be ''horrible for markets.'' He said that he planned to place a major bet that the market would fall but added that, as an American, ''I'm hoping that I'm wasting money.''</p><p>  His thesis is not solely that the Trump presidency will fail, but also that, with policies like tax reform, ''the functional element of Washington may create opportunities, too.''</p><p>  The fund, he said, will help him expand philanthropic efforts at a time when his personal fortune is a fraction of what it once was. Mr. Corzine's net worth has shrunk to less than $40 million today from about $500 million at its height, friends say. He forfeited money in the divorce and spent well over $100 million funding his own political campaigns and many millions more on legal bills, expenses and charity, including donations to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.</p><p>  On Wednesday, he joined the board of Covenant House, a charity that works with homeless children, a cause he took up soon after the death of his son, a photographer who regularly distributed food to the homeless. Discussing his son, who committed suicide at the age of 31, Mr. Corzine said, ''I take, in my heart, some responsibility,'' fighting back tears.</p><p>  ''Until you've lost a child, it's impossible to understand how deeply someone who's suffered that loss will go to save other children from a similar tragedy,'' said Kevin Ryan, the head of Covenant House, who was the children and families commissioner in New Jersey under Mr. Corzine. ''I think the loss of Jeff fuels and haunts and inspires Jon.''</p><p>  Now that he is focusing on opening his new fund, Mr. Corzine wakes up at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets and lands in the office by the 9:30 a.m. opening bell in New York.</p><p>  ''There are some people who look forward to using the blessing of what happens with the 70-plus life,'' he said, by ''catching up on things that they weren't able to do. I want to do that in a context where I feel like I'm still contributing.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: <person><nameText>Jon S.

Lander. Madrid </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> La mala reputaci\u00f3n tiene efectos negativos sobre el negocio. Las entidades tienen que tomarse muy en serio su conducta con los clientes , afirm\u00f3 ayer el gobernador del Banco de Espa\u00f1a, Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos. El continuo desfile de banqueros por la Audiencia Nacional  no ayuda  a mejorar esa reputaci\u00f3n, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, aunque pidi\u00f3 no prejuzgar y esperar a conocer el final de los procesos judiciales. Cos hizo esta afirmaci\u00f3n durante una conferencia pronunciada en la convenci\u00f3n anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Mercados Financieros celebrada en el Casino de Madrid.</p><p>El Comit\u00e9 de Basilea, presidido tambi\u00e9n por \u00e9l, da pr\u00e1cticamente por acabado el proceso de reformas instadas tras la crisis para conseguir que el sector bancario se recapitalice lo suficiente para evitar que se comprometa dinero p\u00fablico en caso de quiebra.</p><p>En su opini\u00f3n, ahora toca evaluar que todos los pa\u00edses cumplen con la normativa de Basilea III en plazo y de manera consistente. Algunas de estas reformas no culminan hasta 2022. Desde la crisis, la exigencia de solvencia se ha m\u00e1s que duplicado.  No existe evidencia que sugiera que nos hayamos excedido en la calibraci\u00f3n de los requerimientos de capital , dijo.</p><p>Desde 2011, la ratio media de capital CET1 ponderada por riesgo ha pasado del 7,2% al 13%.</p><p>Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos pidi\u00f3 al sector que no caiga en la tentaci\u00f3n de entrar en negocios de riesgo para solucionar el problema de la baja rentabilidad de la actividad bancaria.</p><h>Gigantes digitales</h><p>El gobernador del Banco de Espa\u00f1a tambi\u00e9n se refiri\u00f3 a la incursi\u00f3n de los gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos en el negocio de los servicios financieros.  Las big tech pueden contribuir a una mejora en la provisi\u00f3n de algunos servicios financieros, pero tambi\u00e9n pueden llegar a generar riesgos para la estabilidad financiera, para la protecci\u00f3n al consumidor, para la competencia y para la privacidad de los datos. Por tanto, se hace necesario analizar en profundidad estos riesgos potenciales y, en caso necesario, modificar el marco regulatorio para mitigarlos , coment\u00f3.</p><p>Sebasti\u00e1n Albella, presidente de la CNMV, presente en el acto, resalt\u00f3 que Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos ha contribuido a  subir la moral y a recuperar de manera intensa y r\u00e1pida el alt\u00edsimo nivel de prestigio que siempre ha tenido la instituci\u00f3n .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos (dcha.), gobernador del Banco de Espa\u00f1a, dio ayer una conferencia en la convenci\u00f3n anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Mercados Financieros.

This years survey focused on consolidation in the Internet economy and how the growing influence of a handful of powerful players in the online world is shaping its functionality.</p><p>The large platforms such as Facebook and Tencent in social networks, Google and Baidu in search and Amazon and Alibaba in online shopping, dominate large parts of the Internet.  Of those surveyed in APAC, 96% said they depend in some way on the products and services from these companies for most of their online activities, with a similar percentage saying these companies also fully or partly influence how they use and access the Internet.</p><p>The success of these online platforms is driven by convenience and providing easy access to products and services.  However, 60% of survey respondents indicated they would like to have the ability to choose products and services from more than just five companies, while almost half of them believe it will be either difficult or very difficult to find replacements for the Internet giants offerings. The results point to Internet users nuanced views about their habits and preferences.</p><p>This years report will help policymakers and other decision-makers in the region understand that digital consolidation involves a complex set of issues. For instance, while people benefit from big techs products and services, they are concerned about the associated security and privacy threats, and also want more choice in the market from big and small companies.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific Policy Survey 2019 also finds that security continues to be Internet users main concern for the third year in a row.  81% of survey participants in all sub regions cited cybersecurity as the topmost policy concern except for South-East Asia where its superseded by access (with 79% saying its their top concern). Many respondents noted that new Internet-related policies, regulations and laws have been adopted in the past year focusing on issues of concern such as cybercrime, privacy, data protection and access.</p><p>More than 1,300 people from 39 economies across Asia-Pacific answered the online survey in July of this year. The result shows most people with Internet access in APAC are heavy users of big techs products and increasingly reliant on them on a daily basis. These platforms are able to leverage network effects to increasingly diversify their service offerings, and that explains why many users say they depend on their services, explains Rajnesh Singh, APAC Regional Director of the Internet Society.</p><p>However, Internet consumers expect future innovations to come from not only big companies, but also small ones.

My recent purchase of a chair from a website automatically led to a flood of ads for similar furniture on websites, including news websites, I have looked at since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even talking over dinner at home about a prospective holiday means algorithms pick up the topic and the names of potential countries. Ads mysteriously follow. And that's without the disastrous impact of digital platforms on the advertising revenue that used to sustain the traditional business model of journalism, a rather personal as well as public interest issue for me.</p><p>But just how possible it is for any Australian regulator or government or consumer movement to curtail these global forces is much less clear. The admirable attempt by Rod Sims to get to grips with the impact of big tech and digital platforms is better at describing problems than at identifying reforms that do more than tinker at the edge of a technology deluge.</p><p>Yes, consumers, usually without realising it, have traded away any concept of privacy for the convenience and breadth of services offered on platforms like Google and Facebook \"for free\". That means, for example, that every month 19.2 million Australians use Google Search and 17.6 million watch YouTube, which is owned by Google, while 17.3 million access Facebook and 11.2 million access Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.</p><p>Yet even when people do belatedly realise the extent of the commercial exploitation of their personal data, it's dubious whether most or just a sizeable minority would prefer to withdraw - even partially - from this version of unfair exchange.</p><p>It is time-consuming, for example, to have to repeatedly type in personal details or preferences when the algos can just fill in the answers automatically. Stored records of browsing, purchasing and location history can be useful in suggesting items of interest. And who can resist looking at what their friends - or potential friends - are up to or thinking about?</p><p>\"The multiple touchpoints that Google and Facebook each have with their users enable them to collect more user data, improve their services and attract more users and advertisers, creating a virtuous feedback loop,\" the report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission states bluntly.</p><p>That's compounded by the fact more than 70 per cent of websites have a Google tracker and more than 20 per cent of websites have a Facebook tracker.</p><p>People should have the choice, of course, to stop or restrict that feedback flow of information, especially when it is then traded for a range of commercial purposes under the heading of \"big data\". And increasingly, governments and consumer movements around the world are demanding this be made simpler and easier as the reach of digital platform giants becomes ever more intrusive, ever more pervasive and ever more concentrated in its power.</p><p>So the logic of the ACCC report is unarguable.</p><p>\"The benefits that digital platforms have brought to consumers and businesses have not come without costs and consequences,\" it says. \"It is these costs and consequences that governments must now grapple with in Australia and in other countries.\"</p><p>The Morrison government has a few months to figure out its response to this. That's reasonable given the complexity of the issues.</p><p>Less reasonable is any expectation this report or this government can produce significant changes to the big company and mass consumer behaviour locked into such a tight mutual embrace.</p><p>Plenty of other governments and reviews in the US and Europe are also now desperately trying to adjust the brakes on the juggernaut of big tech but to pretty minimal effect thus far.</p><p>The 23 ACCC recommendations include new codes of conduct to handle complaints about fake news, to govern the relationship between digital platforms and traditional media and to regulate data practices in search, social media and content aggregation. It wants stronger privacy protections to allow individuals to demand prompt erasure of their personal information along with greater regulation of data collection overall in the digital economy.</p><p>It suggests financial backing from governments and tax breaks for philanthropists to encourage more local and public interest journalism and it wants a new specialist branch in the ACCC to investigate, monitor and enforce issues in the digital market.</p><p>According to Sims, it is certainly no longer feasible for big tech companies to insist they have no accountability or control over what is available on their platforms. And after the Christchurch massacre, the last vestiges of that rationale have been ripped away in the public mind as well.</p><p>He also wants to combat the lack of transparency and proven ability to eradicate or limit competition. That means, for example, following the European model of requiring Google to now provide users of Android devices choice over the default search engine and internet browser.</p><p>At the moment, Google Chrome is pre-installed on almost all Android devices in Australia while Google Search is the default option on Google Chrome and Apple Safari mobile browsers. Surprise surprise, Google's search engine is effectively the default on over 95 per cent of mobile devices.</p><p>But even the imposition of repeated multibillion-dollar fines or new national taxes on revenue is yet to have much impact on companies harvesting so much money and data around the world every month. Only compulsory break-ups present any real threat to Google or Facebook, for example.</p><p>That makes the ACCC report a useful snapshot of the Australian market - with the prospect of some modest restraints on their aggressive operating model. But little more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76eynfz9tj91eunhqbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-1FV1-F0J6-J3NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

At human scale, one is a yoga instructor who can help you perfect your downward-facing dog; another is a local news anchor who can deliver the news based on interests in your preferred language while a financial adviser Neon can help get your retirement plan in order.</p><p>These videos tried to depict how someone might interact or even form a relationship with such realistic avatars in the future. But in a demo with only one working Neon, the technology today was wonky and plagued with delays. Her emotions and expressions were far less believable in real time and were controlled by the company's CEO, Pranav Mistry, via an app nearby. Onlookers were able to ask questions, but most often, answers missed the mark. For example, when asked what her favorite gadget at CES was, she responded: \"Las Vegas.\"</p><p>Its CES debut came on the heels of a mysterious social media push leading up to the conference, sparking rumors and generating buzz that the next big thing in AI may be coming. But soon after its debut, it was clear the speculation was overblown.</p><p>Mistry admits the technology still needs work (\"It's just a baby right now\"), but his vision is for \"the digital species\" to one day be everywhere - in your favorite chat applications, home or stores. Instead of ordering from kiosk buttons in a fast food restaurant, you could have a natural conversation with a realistic-looking AI human.</p><p>If properly executed, the creations, which are addressed by names like Frank and Hanna (rather than something like \"Hey Google\"), could present an intriguing yet uncomfortable glimpse into what human-like AI lifeforms could mean for our future.</p><p>\"The marketing rhetoric around the Neons is quite extreme at a time when AI generates lots of confusion and anxiety [with topics such as] humans replacing machines, AI ethics issues and deep fakes,\" said Thomas Husson, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. \"But if they're able to successfully express emotions, they would help enhance interactions between consumers and brands, and more broadly humanize technology.\"</p><p>It's tall order for a company that Mistry says has only been working on Neon for four months. Its core technology, a blend of behavioral neural networks and algorithms, has clear limitations, but Mistry said it will soon be able to support original content, expressions, emotions, movements and eventually memory on its own.</p><p>\"Right now, Neon doesn't have any intelligence per se,\" he said. \"They are behaving intelligently, but they don't have the concept of learning or memory. [Eventually], she will remember that you like pizza or something you're reading.\"</p><p>Despite Samsung's backing, Neon is not related to any Samsung products or its Bixby voice systems. A Star Labs spokesperson told CNN Business that Samsung knew few details about the concept ahead of its CES debut.</p><p>Neon plans to launch later this year but has not yet landed on a business model. Mistry said a subscription service is a possibility and it's also working to secure business partnerships.</p><p>The idea of a \"digital species\" is undoubtedly controversial. Big names in tech, including Elon Musk and Bill Gates, have warned about the development of powerful artificial intelligence. Gates called AI both \"promising and dangerous.\" These concerns typically revolve around what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AI that can, for the most part, do the things a human can do.</p><p>\"As demonstrated by Neon, we are still very far from a commercially ready AGI solution,\" principal analyst Lian Jye Su of ABI Research said. \"The best AI nowadays are narrow [ones] that performs singular tasks very well, such as the camera AI in our smartphones, the defect inspection camera AI on an assembly line, and the facial recognition AI in payment terminals.\"</p><p>According to Su, we should \"always question the intention and financial rationale behind attempts to make artificial general intelligence a reality.\"</p><p>Other companies are developing AI that can better converse with us but without a human-like interface. Two years ago, Google showed off Duplex, which allows AI to make human-like phone calls, while Microsoft is growing its Cortana platform to be increasingly responsive.</p><p>Mistry said Neon is aware of the concerns about developing human-like AI.</p><p>\"There's always good and bad [sides] of any technology and how we use it,\" he said. \"That applies to not only AI, but any technology. We believe that it's our human responsibility, and this generation's responsibility, that ... if we [build something] today, we want to ensure that from the ground up from the architecture level, from the design level, that it's not misused in a wrong place.\"</p><p>Neon's concept also comes at a time when companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon are working to gain back consumer trust after a series of data sharing scandals. In 2019, both Amazon and Apple were under fire for using third-party contractors to listen in and transcribe user requests made through their personal assistants. Putting a human-like AI in your home, one that learns your preferences for pizza, behaviors or finances, raises concerns about where intimate information could land.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">           Bloomberg says Warren, Sanders don't 'know what they're talking about' on breaking up big tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/17/magid-an-invitation-to-safer-internet-day/\">           Magid: An invitation to Safer Internet Day       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/16/muslim-millennials-site-dispels-stereotypes-for-millions/\">           Muslim millennial's site dispels stereotypes for millions       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/16/innovation-zone-sprouts-west-san-jose-tech/\">           Innovation Zone sprouts in San Jose       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/16/opinion-cities-should-decide-how-and-where-5g-is-employed/\">           Feinstein: Cities should decide how and where 5G is deployed       </url>   \"Our future can come without compromising our privacy,\" Mistry said. \"And that is what we are designing - an architecture [that makes sure] any interaction between you and your Neon or you and any Neon, no one has, including me, as a CEO of this company, access to that information.\"</p><p>At this stage, a Neon remains a simulated human assistant that merely aims to give intelligent, human-like responses.</p><p>\"But potential implications, such as if such an avatar was embodied into a humanoid robot or could have a true conversation with you, will generate more discussions about AI ethics and regulation,\" Thomas said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6789366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-FX21-JCX4-643H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001QLL</classCode><className>FORRESTER RESEARCH INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Or do you try and integrate it in and try and use it to change your business.</p><p>\"Obviously the danger is when you do that is that you might take some of the best things about the technology or company and lose those in the process.\"</p><p>Banks are likely to have mixed approaches to this, BBVA for example has decided to operate Simple as a separate subsidiary and so will Holvi.</p><p>Nationwide Building Society is one example of a financial services organisation that is both building internally and collaborating in order to innovate.</p><p>Simon Hamilton, CTO of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/\">Nationwide</url>, told CBR: \"We can in some instances go it alone, fintechs' are typically bringing some kind of software asset that is quite specialist and they've worked in a niche area for quite some time so it would be hard to replicate that and speed it up.\"</p><p>Historically the building society would work with software suppliers and Hamilton says that it is still learning how to connect into the fintech world, even though he feels that they are learning quickly.</p><p>\"We are now into double figures that we've built PoCs with and we are on a definite path to live with three of those so the track record is building up,\" he said.</p><p>On the other hand, they can and do innovate by themselves, he said: \"Conversely if I take what we did with giving someone their account balance on first the Android watch and then the Apple watch when it was launched, we built those ourselves.</p><p>\"We worked with one of our established partners, but the core thinking came from Nationwide, the underlying execution of some of that came from one of our established partners, so the innovation was very much ours rather than from a fintech collaboration.\"</p><p>The decision to buy also has addition problems related to integration, Purcell said: \"I think one of the big challenges for the banks is that they are architected on legacy technology, which is 30-40 years old, and it makes it very difficult for them to react to the changing demands of the market,\" said Purcell.</p><p>Banks that decide to build themselves will be building on cloud based technologies and the companies that provide these will be acquired by big tech vendors. FirstCapital has seen companies such as Oracle, SAP and IBM already being active in buying these and putting them into their own technology.</p><p>The alternative to this is that if banks don't build it themselves then they will buy the fintech company and not just their software.</p><p>Examples of this strategy are already appearing, for example BBVA recently acquired a Finnish banking start-up called Holvi, which is an online business banking service. BBVA also snapped up US banking start-up Simple for $117m in 2014.<br/><br/>Both acquisitions increase BBVA's presence and services in areas that it felt required improving and perhaps were starting to feel under pressure in.</p><p>Banks have come under increasing pressure in the areas of lending, wealth management and in payments and this is leading to two outcomes either developing capabilities themselves or just buying the fintech company.</p><p>Purcell said: \"In many of the core functions of the banks they've got somebody who's challenging them. I think some of the banks will react by trying to develop that capability themselves, other will have to just buy.\"</p><p>A report from <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fintechinnovationlablondon.co.uk/\">Accenture</url> found that first quarter 2016 investment in fintech ventures reached $5.3bn, a 67% increase over the same period last year.</p><p>According to the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/enterprise-it/it-services/accenture-pwc-deloitte-ibm-kpmg-which-consulting-firm-is-best-for-you-4802304\">report</url>, collaborative fintech ventures are gaining ground over disruptive players that have entered the market in order to compete against the incumbent organisation.</p><p>In 2010 the funding for collaborative fintech ventures accounted for 38% of all fintech investment and this grew to 44% of total funding in 2015. Even those that enter the market as disruptors often find themselves collaborating with the established names through investments, acquisitions and alliances.</p><p>This is highlighted by BBVA's decision to buy a stake in Atom Bank worth $67 million.</p><p>What this highlights is that there is certainly interest from both sides in collaborating, whether or not they at first start out as rivals.</p><p>If banks decide to go down the M&amp;A route the question should be asked whether it is good for the market. Fintechs' have brought disruption and innovation to a market that was stagnant and there is the risk that a spate of acquisitions could remove that innovation.</p><p>Purcell doesn't feel that this is the case, saying: \"The risk of all these companies being bought and squashed is less because they (banks) need to make this change; they're not doing it because they want to, they're doing it because they have to.\"</p><p>However, he does say that there is a risk that when companies get acquired they lose the innovation that made them.</p><p>With increased regulatory and customer pressure demanding change, banks have to act, which means they are more likely to utilise the innovation from fintechs' than to waste it. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PDMNEW-4865118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PDMNEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JJC-D5D1-JCF9-20NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Progressive Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Progressive Media - Company News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33806\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0002CID</classCode><className>NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS522292 REAL ESTATE CREDIT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGF</classCode><className>LIBERAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0EC</classCode><className>MERGERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkZCODBEQTBEMjdDNDA1Njk5NDIxQjQ3MThGQ0MyMUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjRDRTUzQzBCMEIyNDU5QkE4QjFDMEE2Qjg2MUZDOTk</classCode><className>Mergers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001118</classCode><className>MERGERS &amp;
