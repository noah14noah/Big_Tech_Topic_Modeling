Today, the series ends with market power: ad technology dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As German publisher Axel Springer's senior vice-president Dr. Dietrich von Kl\u00e4den told the INMA, all news media companies today \"are facing the challenges of a dysfunctional online advertising market in which two-thirds of the advertising revenues are going to two global digital platforms.</p><p>\"High-quality journalism is expensive to produce,\" he said. \"At the moment, the platforms take all journalistic content and use it without adequate financial compensation.\"</p><p>Publishers and advertisers often have no choice but to use - and sometimes pay for - a tech giant's related tools and products when wanting to advertise or publish content on their platforms. These tools offer little transparency around policies and processes including ad exchanges, which are digital marketplaces that allow companies and publishers to buy and sell advertising space, often through real-time auctions.</p><p>Google's market share of ad exchange services is 66 per cent. Its closest competitor holds 11 per cent of the market. Google used that dominance in April to launch \"unified pricing rules,\" which stopped publishers from setting granular pricing, limiting how they compete. A month later it dealt publishers another blow when it introduced a \"fair access agreement\" requiring competitors to provide Google with visibility on all their bids and transactions.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Revamp fees, commissions and revenue sharing.</p><p>Platforms should lower fees they impose on publishers for everything from web hosting to licences for technologies - because publishers are engaged in working for the public good and producing quality journalism, INMA says. It believes such a solution is possible because it has already seen platforms strive to be flexible in signing different revenue fee deals based on the size and prominence of news publishers. Facebook, INMA points out, has led the way by introducing a news subscription tool at no cost or hidden fees for publishers. \"This improved on Google's attempt to undercut Apple by introducing a 5 per cent fee for a subscription transaction, which Google has said repeatedly is only to cover its cost,\" INMA says.</p><p>Allow publishers to collectively bargain with the platforms for better terms.</p><p>INMA says Facebook and Google account for about 90 per cent of all digital advertising revenue growth, so \"they exert enormous power over publishers in all negotiations.\" Lawmakers and advocates behind the U.S. Journalism Competition and Preservation Act are attempting to change that by pushing for publications to land the ability to collectively negotiate fairer advertising revenue pricing terms without the threat of legal recourse from platforms and regulating agencies. They are hoping the act will trigger algorithm stability, increase publisher access to data, end the suppression of media brands and deliver funds to publishers. They believe the act will give them leverage to argue that because Facebook and Google licenses and pays for other kinds of content, including music, they should be willing to pay for news.</p><p>Remove ad sales conflicts.</p><p>INMA is calling for the regulation of ad pricing, independent auditing of the practice and the restriction of forced bundling of tools, services and products. Given that regulators have been unable to stop Google from repeatedly swallowing up ad tech businesses, INMA would also like to see Google separate its ad technologies from its advertising business and hold them in a separate, possibly independent trust. INMA believes this could lower costs and drive competition in the ad market.</p><p>Ad tech regime.</p><p>INMA has suggested tech companies could create an independent, non-profit ad tech regime that links clients directly with all entertainment, music, news and web publishing companies. INMA believes this would reduce fees and repatriate most or all of the 70 per cent of ad money that currently disappears to intermediaries standing between advertisers and publishers.</p><p>National ID sign-ons.</p><p>A global initiative that would create national identification sign-ons across banking, telecommunications companies, retail and news media using hyper-secure technology could quash the destructive allure of using platforms for sign-ins, INMA argues. Such a sign-in would be as simple to use as those currently operated by tech platforms, but would bypass the platforms altogether, allow data to be collected and ensure power is not consolidated by the digital giants. It would also disrupt Apple's current model, which requires apps in its App Store with social login opportunities to offer sign-ins with Apple ID. Apple does not share that data with publishers unless a consumer opts in and beginning later this year INMA says a new feature will allow consumers to sign up by default through an anonymized email address Apple provides to a publisher.</p><p>Last in a Star series examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.

Some Japanese companies, meanwhile, are looking to China\u2019s 5G telecoms rollout with eager expectation. Check out the almost unbelievable prices being offered in India by the online marketplace Club Factory. And staying with India, tech funds are keeping the faith, raising big money to invest in the country\u2019s start-up ecosystem. Finally, what will Terry Gou\u2019s excuses be when he meets President Donald Trump at the White House Christmas party?</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story \u2014 Exclusive</p><p>Taiwan is haemorrhaging semiconductor engineering talent to mainland China. As many as 3,000 chip engineers, including top-level talent from Taiwan\u2019s world-leading companies, have been lured by generous salary and benefits packages to mainland competitors, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Taiwan-loses-3-000-chip-engineers-to-Made-in-China-2025\"> this article</url> in the Nikkei Asian Review.</p><p>\u201cThe goal is to bring Taiwanese talent to the mainland and hollow out Taiwan,\u201d said Meng Chih-cheng of Taiwan\u2019s National Cheng Kung University.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis> China\u2019s Achilles heel in its tech war with the US lies with its lagging semiconductor industry. But it is determined to boost its capabilities and become more self-reliant. Recruiting top talent from Taiwan is a relatively straightforward way to do that.</p><p>There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-memory-chip-output-zooms-from-zero-to-5-of-world-total\"> important signs</url> that China\u2019s chip industry is making big strides forward. The country is on track to produce about 5 per cent of the world\u2019s memory chips by the end of 2020, having stood at virtually zero only a few years ago. Yangtze Memory Technologies and ChangXin Memory Technologies, two big new mainland chip plants, have received an upsurge in orders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis> Some of the top talent that has left Taiwan-based companies such as TSMC, United Microelectronics, MediaTek, Inotera Memories, Siliconware Precision Industries and other companies would have taken to the mainland key knowledge and insight. Luring talent is one of the mainland\u2019s key strategies in fostering self-reliance.\u00a0</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>There are more legal troubles ahead for TikTok, which is owned by<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Chinese</emphasis> group ByteDance.

She told reporters afterward she met with Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. Jourova was also scheduled to meet with FTC Chairman Joe Simons Thursday.</p><p>Jourova supports a light-touch approach to tech enforcement, which she said the European Commission has carried out. Hopefully, incoming commissioners maintain that soft touch, she said. The answer isn't to break up big tech companies, she said, but to extend democratic values online, with a solid foundation of freedom and fairness. Ex-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler thinks such companies should share data rather than being broken up, he said earlier Thursday (see 1904110025).</p><p>The U.S. and EU are facing similar challenges, Jourova said, like election manipulation through social media. Elections should be competitions of ideas, not competitions for who can best use dirty money, she said, citing the Cambridge Analytica privacy breach.</p><p>Jourova described two camps responding to privacy. One, which includes the EU, understands the need for more control over data and that all players have to respect limitations. The second has a lax approach to privacy, favoring uncontrolled access to data in the name of business and government, she said. \"I want the U.S. to join the first camp.\"</p><p>Jourova noted good relationships with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the FTC in maintaining the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. But she said the EU had to wait too long, about two years, for the administration to name a permanent PS ombudsperson.</p><p>Jourova warned against algorithms being used for political purposes. Algorithms work well for selling consumers products, she said, but they shouldn't be used to sell political candidates. Platforms shouldn't moderate political debates and influence votes, she said, calling the possibility \"dangerous.\"</p><p>Jourova praised impacts of the EU's general data protection regulation, which she said has shifted the focus of privacy onto consumer control: \"We should continue to put people first.\" None of the doomsday scenarios about the GDPR has come true, she said. But policies like this are only part of the solution, she said, warning policymakers not to \"overdue\" it. Social media shouldn't be blamed for all social ills, she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-KWJ1-JC8G-839H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Each year, these symposia provide key antitrust regulators and industry leaders a forum to discuss recent developments and unveil future enforcement priorities. This year's events focused on technology and innovation, merger control and enforcement, antitrust and public policy, and litigation trends. Key Takeaways Technology and InnovationAt Fordham, the influence of the current populist and pro-enforcement political environment was evident as discussions focused on how antitrust regulation and enforcement can keep up with the digital or \"Big Tech\" economy and be better equipped to intervene in anticompetitive conduct. </p><p>Several panelists emphasized procedural or structural changes their respective agencies had made or were considering to appropriately evaluate such a rapidly evolving area. For example, Daniel Francis, associate director for Digital Markets at the FTC, noted that the FTC has formed a new Technology Task Force that will focus on enforcement in technology markets to keep pace with the changing digital economy. At Georgetown, Bilal Sayyed, director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, similarly highlighted that one of the FTC's highest priorities is publishing guidance on the application of antitrust law to conduct by dominant technology firms. He also noted that big data and artificial intelligence may be topics of the FTC's future hearings.Some panelists noted the challenges associated with regulating the evolving digital economy from a substantive perspective. At Fordham, for example, Alexandre Barreto de Souza, president of CADE, emphasized the importance of understanding different types of data and how remedies affect both sides of a data-driven platform. At Georgetown, Barry Nigro, principal deputy attorney general at the DOJ, stated that, although antitrust tools will need to be improved as regulators learn more about Big Tech, traditional tools like the consumer welfare standard can adequately ensure that Big Tech companies behave competitively. Also at Georgetown, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), remarked that the CMA was focused on avoiding past mistakes of non-intervention on tech mergers, soliciting complaints about past tech acquisitions and investigating the digital advertising sector. Andreas Mundt, president of German Bundeskartellamt, likewise noted at Georgetown that his office is becoming more engaged in digital markets, including by prohibiting Facebook's collection of data as conduct that allegedly breaches privacy rules and constitutes abuse of a dominant position (a decision that has been stayed pending appeal), as well as by conducting a sector inquiry into online advertising.Merger Control and EnforcementMerger enforcement was another popular topic at both events. At Georgetown, Barry Nigro touted the DOJ's use of binding arbitration to define the relevant product market in merger cases for its potential time and cost savings. He also suggested that agencies' continued ability to conduct \"quick look\" searching review in merger cases is at risk if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's approach to Tunney Act review in the CVS/Aetna deal becomes commonplace. Nigro reasoned that agencies may have to extensively investigate all overlaps (even those that they believe do not present material antitrust issues) if Tunney Act review were to require the DOJ to prove via testimony or other evidence the absence of anticompetitive effects in areas outside of the agency's complaint. Meanwhile, at Fordham, former DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew Finch remarked that aggressive vertical merger enforcement will likely continue and that the DOJ and FTC are moving forward to create a single guidance document on non-horizontal mergers as an update to the DOJ's 1984 guidelines. In his Fordham remarks, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim also stressed the DOJ's commitment to international cooperation and comity in reviewing mergers to prevent inefficiencies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Notably, there was no criticism of foreign authorities' targeting of U.S. tech companies.At Georgetown, Kathy O'Neill, senior director of Investigation and Litigation at the DOJ, noted that the DOJ will not limit its analysis to traditional market share and concentration, but will continue to explore vertical theories, such as foreclosure. Ian Conner, deputy director at the FTC's Bureau of Competition, remarked that the FTC is looking to continue its trend of reviewing consummated mergers. Additionally, several regulators at Georgetown stressed that merging parties should raise efficiency defenses early in the merger review process. At Fordham, Andrew Finch stated that the DOJ has not changed its approach to fashioning behavioral and structural relief, and confirmed the DOJ's historical preference for the latter. Regulators shared similar sentiments at Georgetown, where Gail Levine, deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, observed that behavioral remedies are rarely imposed. She further signaled openness to the possibility of unbundling as a remedy, as has been used in Europe.Antitrust and Public PolicyPanelists also opined about the direction of various antitrust policies. At Fordham, FTC Chairman Simons signaled support for reauthorizing the U.S. Safe Web Act as a permanent part of the FTC Act, as it gives the FTC strong power on cross-border enforcement actions. For example, Simons highlighted the important efficiencies gained by effective information sharing in cross-border enforcement actions and noted that the Safe Web Act broadens the FTC's ability to share confidential information with foreign law enforcers.Meanwhile, at Georgetown, Gail Levine discussed the \"unintended consequences\" of mixing political goals with antitrust, including that adopting measures designed to protect domestic firms can leave them ill-equipped to compete abroad. Also at Georgetown, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive at the CMA, stressed that the upcoming U.K. election and Brexit decision will significantly influence antitrust review and that the CMA has already started to independently investigate mergers despite a parallel review in Brussels.Litigation TrendsFinally, conference panelists spoke on trends in antitrust litigation, including how varying approaches to antitrust claims create challenges in bringing and defending against class action litigation. At Fordham, for example, panelists discussed a potential divide over the standard of review in franchise no-poach cases. Some courts, panelists noted, have denied motions to dismiss after concluding that quick-look or per se analysis may apply to the claims, but other courts could be persuaded by the DOJ's position (outlined in statements of interest filed in other franchise no-poach cases) asking courts to apply the more permissive rule of reason. Despite this uncertainty, Fordham panelists noted that additional guidance may emerge as courts issue rulings in cases that survived motions to dismiss and are now approaching the class certification stage. Panelists similarly suggested that the analysis in these cases may be clarified by challenges to class allegations at the motion to dismiss stage.Also at Fordham, panelists emphasized how the presence or absence of raw data can impact a putative class action. Panelists, for example, discussed cases in which courts have grappled with how many uninjured class members could be sufficient to defeat class certification. Panelists also remarked on the importance of this data in the indirect purchaser class action context, particularly when courts require plaintiffs to show that a proposed class is \"ascertainable\" under Rule 23, i.e., that class members can be identified through objective criteria and a reliable and administratively feasible process. As one panelist noted, plaintiffs may face challenges obtaining the downstream data needed to make this showing.* * *We will continue to follow global developments in these areas, the issues emerging in them and any antitrust scrutiny that follows.Download PDF[1] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skadden.com/-/media/files/publications/2019/10/takeawaysfromthegeorgetownandfordhamglobalantitrus.pdf\">https://www.skadden.com/-/media/files/publications/2019/10/takeawaysfromthegeorgetownandfordhamglobalantitrus.pdf</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111571189456219251766500176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-54G1-F03R-N35S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1421\"/><timeReceived>1:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FORDHAM UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I am no big fan of shareholder \u201cactivists\u201d like him. In fact, I think the old sobriquet, \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d, was more accurate. But the letter that Mr Singer\u2019s investment firm Elliott Management sent last week to AT&amp;T\u2019s board of directors couldn\u2019t be truer. </p><p>The telecoms group, which orchestrated a controversial and ill-advised merger with Time Warner last year, is an underperforming, mismanaged dodo bird of a company \u2014 big enough to have racked up <url normalizedValue=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4213097-t-risky-190b-debt\"> $190bn in debt</url> yet not large enough to fend off the Big Tech apex predators ready to eat its lunch. </p><p>I predict it will someday be a case study about how corporate arrogance destroyed a tonne of value. It is also a marker for where tech, media, and the market in general may be headed.</p><p>It is tough to argue with Mr Singer\u2019s maths. Elliott, which owns a $3.2bn stake in AT&amp;T, says the company \u201cnot only failed to keep pace with the broader market, but has actually underperformed by over 150 percentage points\u201d over the past decade. Not good, especially at a time when most boats were rising. </p><p>Still, that alone wouldn\u2019t make me cheer for activist involvement. Corporations can underperform for many reasons, including investing in their future. It is a shame that markets all too often penalise a company for building its business rather than handing money back to shareholders.</p><p>But that is not the case with AT&amp;T. Over the past 10 years, it has tried to buy growth, awkwardly, with a series of expensive merger and acquisition deals. These include a failed attempt to buy T-Mobile, the purchase of DirecTV at the very peak of the traditional television market, and most recently Time Warner. Elliott correctly points out that this has made AT&amp;T \u201can outlier in terms of its M&amp;A strategy: most companies today no longer seek to assemble conglomerates\u201d.</p><p>Too many of those that do so are trying to compete with the sheer heft of the platform technology giants, with no coherent strategy. This is particularly true at the intersection of technology and media. Google\u2019s YouTube has a billion users. Apple and Facebook together spend billions on video content. Amazon and Netflix are moving into the premium space once solely occupied by Time Warner\u2019s groundbreaking cable network, HBO. And the AT&amp;T merger has driven away top talent, like former HBO chief Richard Plepler and other senior executives, who could undoubtedly see that content would not be king in the new organisation.</p><p>This is not a morality play about spoiled creatives resisting bean-counters. It is a culture problem. After AT&amp;T completed its DirecTV acquisition, the entire management team from that company also departed. The result is a corporation that is bigger but certainly not better. I suspect that AT&amp;T will struggle to invest in top quality content and 5G \u2014 the high-speed network that should ultimately be its bread and butter \u2014 while servicing in its massive debt. That will be particularly true if interest rates start to rise.</p><p>Bottom line: scale as strategy is played out in this late stage, overleveraged market. Being the biggest can help, but it can also hurt. Silicon Valley\u2019s content might become less profitable if a recession leads to a downturn in the advertising market. Uber is laying off <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/technology/uber-layoffs.html\"> hundreds of people</url> and warning that it can no longer just grow without worrying about profits.</p><p>Whatever their size, the winning companies will be those that are profitable. That may sound obvious, but it hasn\u2019t been for the past decade, as easy money has dulled investor senses. Now, they are waking up and want to see results. The scepticism over WeWork\u2019s upcoming initial public offering is a case in point. For every dollar the company earns, it spends two, maths that works better on private ledgers than in the public markets.</p><p>All this chimes with Mr Singer\u2019s move on AT&amp;T. Activists are often the canaries in the coal mine for large, lasting market trends. When Carl Icahn demanded a few years back that <url normalizedValue=\"http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2159274,00.html\">Apple return billions in cash</url> to investors, it signalled a broader shift towards record corporate share buybacks and dividend payments. </p><p>Elliott\u2019s letter could mark a similar turning point. The growth of passive investing in entire markets has masked a wide divergence in corporate value within sectors. I think you will now see activists start circling like sharks around fat corporate seals in telecoms, media, and utilities that have most obviously tried to buy growth.</p><p>Meanwhile their Big Tech competitors are already being circled by regulators. Last week, California passed a new law aimed at forcing many companies to treat gig workers as employees, which would be a huge cost hit for companies like Uber. Attorneys-general from 50 US states and territories in the US have launched an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s dominance of search and advertising, while New York is leading a probe of Facebook\u2019s monopoly power.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank's monetary policy framework review.</p><p>The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.</p><p>To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed's 2% target.</p><p>2/NATIONAL SERVICE</p><p>Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector's downward trend in the first quarter.</p><p>The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.</p><p>The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.</p><p>Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year's while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won't be growing, as the filings will show.-China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013-China's banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013</p><p>3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?</p><p>The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar's decline as the world's reserve currency.</p><p>Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.</p><p>And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar's 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold's eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.</p><p>Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.</p><p>4/VALUE SIRENS</p><p>Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.</p><p>Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.</p><p>A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won't touch them with a barge pole.</p><p>Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap.</p><p>5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE</p><p>Belarus's political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country's main economic ally.</p><p>Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko's 'landslide' election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it's not obvious how the tensions get resolved.</p><p>For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia's currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.</p><p>Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny's allies alleging poisoning.</p><p>Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Megan Davies, Chuck Mikolajczak and Dan Burns in New York, Saikat Chatterjee, Julien Ponthus and Marc Jones in London, compiled by Karin Strohecker in London; Editing by Toby Chopra</p><p>Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</p><p>Reuters</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/67/159803056744.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/67/159803056744.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-182655738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N1-PKJ1-F11P-X4XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank's monetary policy framework review.   The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.   To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.   The Five-year, five-year inflation <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzmqygvw/Five-year%20five-year%20inflation.PNG\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzmqygvw/Five-year%20five-year%20inflation.PNG</url>   2/NATIONAL SERVICE   Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector's downward trend in the first quarter.   The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.   The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.   Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year's while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show.   China Big 5 banks' earnings <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwaendpw/Pasted%20image%201597988457429.png\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwaendpw/Pasted%20image%201597988457429.png</url>   3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?   The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar's decline as the world's reserve currency.   Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.   And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar's 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold's eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.   Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.   USD positions and CFTC <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaqnebva/USD%20positions%20and%20CFTC.JPG\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaqnebva/USD%20positions%20and%20CFTC.JPG</url>   4/VALUE SIRENS   Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.   Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.   A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won't touch them with a barge pole.   Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap.   Growth vs Value stocks <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkeowovm/Pasted%20image%201597745866616.png\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkeowovm/Pasted%20image%201597745866616.png</url>   5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE   Belarus's political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country's main economic ally.  Story continues  Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s 'landslide' election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it's not obvious how the tensions get resolved.   For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia's currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.   Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny's allies alleging poisoning.   Belarus bonds and rouble have been stumbling <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvllwwavb/Pasted%20image%201598006808103.png\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvllwwavb/Pasted%20image%201598006808103.png</url>   (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Megan Davies, Chuck Mikolajczak and Dan Burns in New York, Saikat Chatterjee, Julien Ponthus and Marc Jones in London, compiled by Karin Strohecker in London; Editing by Toby Chopra)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42891792566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-TRD1-F07F-8193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"993\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank's monetary policy framework review.    The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.    To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.

The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.    The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.    Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year's while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show.-China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013-China's banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013    Graphic: China Big 5 banks' earnings <url normalizedValue=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwaendpw/Pasted%20image%201597988457429.png\">https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwaendpw/Pasted%20image%201597988457429.png</url>    The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar's decline as the world's reserve currency.    Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.    And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar's 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold's eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.    Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.

Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.    A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won't touch them with a barge pole.    Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap.

Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s 'landslide' election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it's not obvious how the tensions get resolved.    For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia's currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.    Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny's allies alleging poisoning.

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank\u2019s monetary policy framework review.    The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.    To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards \u2013 an inflation gauge \u2013 have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. -Fed Chair Powell to speak on Fed\u2019s framework review next Thursday -Coronavirus legacy will be weak global inflation: economists    2/NATIONAL SERVICE    Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector\u2019s downward trend in the first quarter.    The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.    The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.    Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year\u2019s while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be growing, as the filings will show. -China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c -China\u2019s banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Xinhua \u00e2\u20ac\u201c    3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?    The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar\u2019s decline as the world\u2019s reserve currency.    Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.    And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar\u2019s 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold\u2019s eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.    Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs. -King dollar\u2019s decline ripples across the globe. -U.S. dollar headed lower, in retreat against the euro    4/VALUE SIRENS    Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.    Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.    A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won\u2019t touch them with a barge pole.    Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general \u2013 and the COVID-19 market in particular \u2013 investors are wary of the value-trap. -LIVE MARKETS-Value sirens singing the blues -Capital exited stock markets as S&amp;P hit new record \u2013 BofA    5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE    Belarus\u2019s political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country\u2019s main economic ally.    Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u2018landslide\u2019 election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it\u2019s not obvious how the tensions get resolved.    For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia\u2019s currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.    Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny\u2019s allies alleging poisoning.    -Pompeo says U.S. supports international probe of Belarus election -Belarusian protesters defy Lukashenko, EU announces sanctions -ANALYSIS-Putin bets on Lukashenko keeping power in Belarus for now \u2013 sources    (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Megan Davies, Chuck Mikolajczak and Dan Burns in New York, Saikat Chatterjee, Julien Ponthus

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank\u2019s monetary policy framework review.   The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.   To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.   Graphic: Five-year five-year inflati here   2/NATIONAL SERVICE  Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector\u2019s downward trend in the first quarter.   The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.   The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.   Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year\u2019s while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show.-China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013-China\u2019s banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013   Graphic: China Big 5 banks' earnings here   3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?  The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar\u2019s decline as the world\u2019s reserve currency.   Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.   And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar\u2019s 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold\u2019s eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.   Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.   Graphic: USD positions and CFTC here   4/VALUE SIRENS  Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.   Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.

Regulation deters investment and the coronavirus health crisis has revealed that ample bandwidth is vital for working and learning at home. Net neutrality regulations are at odds with encouraging infrastructure investment and with the flexibility of network management that has proved so crucial in keeping Americans online. Additionally, broadband infrastructure is a significant economic contributor and will aid in the country's financial recovery from this unprecedented financial shock.[1]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investment in broadband infrastructure declined beginning in 2015 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted heavy-handed public utility-style regulation of the Internet, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.[2] Investment shrunk by $500 million between 2014 and 2015 and by $2.7 billion between 2015 and 2016.[3]</p><p>Investment Rebounds. In late 2017 the FCC reversed course under a new administration and lifted the utility-style regulations. Investment increased by $2.1 billion between 2016 and 2017 and to $3.1 billion between 2017 and 2018. Broadband speeds are up by approximately 85 percent since the end of 2016.[4] Robust spending in the years since regulations were repealed ensured the resiliency of the nation's broadband network under the recent increased demand. Eliminating the threat of investment-deterring regulations would likely spur continued and increased investment in broadband infrastructure.</p><p>Similarly, eliminating the threat of a 50-state patchwork of state net neutrality laws would likely incentivize spending for an even more robust network. More than 30 states have made legislative moves toward instituting their own net neutrality regulations since the federal repeal.[5] Not only are state proposals ripe for interstate commerce challenges, they are a real threat to return on investment for broadband providers.[6] Congress should act to preempt these state laws.</p><p>Light-Touch Regulation Yields More Infrastructure Investment. Much of the broadband industry was ready to trade away the right to employ certain business practices in exchange for regulatory certainty, preemption of state net neutrality laws, and a rejection of utility-style Title II regulations at the federal level.[7] But broadband performance in the United States and the European Union during the health crisis should make both industry and Congress reconsider that tradeoff.</p><p>Europe provides an illuminating contrast to the U.S.'s light-touch regulatory approach. The EU has taken a more utility-style, heavy regulatory approach to broadband.[8] Accordingly, the EU has less per-capita investment in Internet infrastructure.[9] Like Americans across the pond, European citizens stayed home to slow the spread of COVID-19 and increased stress on their telecommunications network. Their regulators began to worry that the broadband infrastructure could not handle the increased demand. At the request of EU officials, Netflix, Facebook, Disney, and Amazon all agreed to reduce the quality of their content or delay launches of new services in order to prevent potential Internet congestion in Europe.[10] Meanwhile, U.S. broadband networks have been handling their demand surge handily.</p><p>The better performance of U.S. networks, as compared to their strained European counterparts, recommend the American light regulatory approach.</p><p>The second insight gleaned from seeing how the two different regulatory approaches play out in a crisis lies in the EU fix. European officials asked content providers to deliberately slow their content. This practice is known as throttling and can be done by edge providers or ISPs. But it is illegal for ISPs to do so under EU net neutrality laws and it is one of the practices that would be outlawed by proposed U.S. net neutrality legislation. Banning ISPs from doing the same thing that regulators would end up asking content providers to do is clearly incoherent public policy. Stateside, politicians and regulators should learn from Europe's mistake and not ban business practices that may come in handy one day, under unforeseen circumstances. Lawmakers cannot see the future, as European regulators have discovered during this crisis.</p><p>And who is to say the same will not be true for the other two practices net neutrality regulations seek to ban, namely, blocking and paid prioritization? Net neutrality regulations would ban Internet providers from blocking any legal content. The reasoning for such a ban is dubious. After all, broadband companies own their private lines and should be able to choose what goes over them. That raises the question: Do consumers really need the government dictating a no-blocking policy that so tramples on Internet service providers property rights?[11] Furthermore, there is scant evidence that ISPs have ever intentionally blocked access to legal content since the practice was legalized in 2017.[12]</p><p>Similarly, net neutrality regulations would prevent broadband companies from accepting payment from content providers in exchange for moving their data across the network more quickly. This is known as paid prioritization. Can we envision how paying more for some critical services to be delivered faster over networks might be beneficial for consumers? Remote surgeries and telehealth applications come to mind these days.[13] Consumers benefit from more options at different price points. Paid prioritization on broadband service is no exception.</p><p>Conclusion. Congress should pass federal legislation preempting state net neutrality regulation and codifying the Internet's classification as an information service, but not outlawing the potentially beneficial practices of blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. This would encourage investment in U.S. broadband infrastructure by eliminating the threat of state and federal regulation. More robust networks will benefit American citizens and businesses in the difficult struggle for economic recovery ahead.</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Michael Minges, \"Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth,\" World Development Report, World Bank, January 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf\">http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf</url>.</p><p>[2] Federal Communications Commission, \"In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,\"</p><p>GN Docket No. 14-28, FCC 15-24, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, Adopted: February 26, 2015 Released: March 12, 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf\">https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf</url>.</p><p>[3] Patrick Brogan, \"Broadband Capex Growth Propels Deployment,\" USTELECOM, Broadband Association, July 31, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/\">https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/</url>.</p><p>[4] FCC Commissioner Brendoa Carr, Twitter post by @BrendanCarrFCC, February 20, 2020, 2:24 PM, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20\">https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20</url>.</p><p>[5] Heather Morton, \"Net Neutrality Legislation in States,\" National Conference of State Legislatures, January 23, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx\">https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx</url>.</p><p>[6] Jessica Melugin, \"U.S. Justice Department Challenges California Net Neutrality Rules,\" OpenMarket, Competitive Enterprise Institute, October 1, 2018,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules\">https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules</url>.</p><p>[7] Klint Finley, \"Republicans in Congress Are Talking Net Neutrality;

It would then encourage the public to find its news there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACC) has published a draft code that requires Facebook and Google pay media for news content and negotiate other issues, but both have recoiled against the move.</p><p>Last month Google promoted an open letter via its search and YouTube, claiming the move would dramatically worsen Google search. It also extensively lobbied politicians against the ACCC move. That lobbying seems to have had little impact with both sides of federal parliament and crossbenchers behind the ACCC's moves.</p><p>Yesterday Facebook threatened to stop posting news altogether. \"Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" says Will Easton, managing director, Facebook ANZ.</p><p>\"This is not our first choice - it is our last. But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.\"</p><p/><p>Mr Easton's remarks suggest there are likely two approaches going forward: either deals are struck with Facebook and Google by agreement or through arbitration, or the tech giants walk away from publishing news in Australia altogether.</p><p>While many in news organisations might be nervous about the prospect of media organisations cutting ties with Facebook and Google, and losing millions of eyeballs who visit news sites via these platforms, at least in the short term, others believe a total separation would be a better long-term outcome. It would end the enslavement of news organisations to gaining eyeballs from social media and enhance their ability to build independent advertising strategies.</p><p>One alternative would see news organisations build and promote their own portals as a one-stop shop for the public to search for serious news from authoritative sources, and leave Facebook and Google to deal with the conspiracy theories and misinformation purporting to be news - material they struggle to mediate.</p><p>Professor Henningham says media groups should get together to \"coax and persuade\" readers to come to independent new aggregation sites. He says they could drop paywalls temporarily to attract readers, and build new subscription models across publications/</p><p>He says a divorce from Facebook and Google rather than a \"shotgun marriage\" might be better.</p><p/><p>\"I can see benefits for the media in being not dependent upon the power, the massive power of Google and Facebook which, as we all know, have stripped the revenue of the mainstream news media and mostly destroyed them, and killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, the journalism.\"</p><p>Professor Henningham says peoples' online habits had changed markedly over time, and it wouldn't be hard to persuade them to search for news away from social media.</p><p>He said the internet landscape had changed rapidly since the days when Netscape, America Online (AOL), MySpace and Yahoo were dominant.</p><p>\"There's no reason to assume that these people, any more than the US railroads, are going to be around forever. They may already be starting their decline. I think 'take them on'.\"</p><p>He believes throwing down the gauntlet offers a better prospect than depending on government regulation. \"It's really just a matter of changing people's approach to getting information.</p><p>\"In times of crisis like coronavirus and bushfires, news really comes into its own, because people want reliable timely information, they're desperate for it.</p><p>\"They realise that there is another way. We can get our views, not by going to Facebook but going directly to the sites or the aggregation of the sites.\"</p><p>Community organisation Responsible Technology Australia also has taken issue with Mr Easton's comments.</p><p>\"Facebook threatening to pull reliable, factual content from Australians' newsfeeds is a sign of just how out of control these platforms are,\" says Chris Cooper, executive director of RTA. </p><p>\"That Facebook would suggest blocking news in the middle of a pandemic, when accurate information is a key plank of the public health response really tells you all you need to know about how much (Facebook CEO Mark) Zuckerberg cares about Australian society and cohesion.</p><p>\"It is highly disturbing to hear Google and Facebook describe 'news' as nothing more than a line item on a balance sheet. Both platforms are dangerously casual about the prospect of operating platforms in which real news has been abandoned or de-prioritised, leaving misinformation to fill the void.</p><p>\"The difference between information and misinformation and the value of the news to the functioning of democracy doesn't seem to exercise Facebook or Google's leaders. They see regulation as an inconvenient impost on their immediate profits - and the hostility of their response should tell Australian policymakers that regulation is needed.</p><p>\"Democracies around the world are waking up to a whole host of concerns about how Google and Facebook operate, the negative effect they cause, and the out-size power they wield.\"</p><p>Unlike Professor Henningham, Mr Cooper sees regulation as the way forward. He says the social media giants portray themselves as representing younger people; the truth is these platforms have let down young people badly.</p><p>Instead of fostering a journalists environment which uncovers major news stories, they are fed a diet of conspiracy theories and misinformation.</p><p>\"Absolutely, If you look at the incentives and the priorities and the priorities of the platforms ... they do that by serving content and creating content which leans into the more sensational outrageous conspiratorial because that is what holds our attention.</p><p>\"They've absolutely done a disservice to young people, and all Australians in this way.</p><p>\"Our position on this is that these companies have grown to a size which means that they have dominance and monopoly control over something that's really important for democracy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-ac63c0921f5a65264b2f9a20d81dc09b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RJ-B8P1-JBR4-F3K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1068\"/><timeReceived>2:27 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Their aim apparently is that more protesters can achieve the security by obscurity that most of us expect in crowds with less law enforcement bodies able to scan and identify individual protesters, or, even worse, identify all the protesters at a site.This is a good thing, right?New IBM CEO Arvid Krishna wrote to Congress about why IBM was proposing to break its government contracts, concerned that police would use the tech to violate basic human rights. Amazon used a company blog post to announce its own suspension of police access to Rekognition, its facial recognition software, for a year. </p><p>Microsoft then said it would suspend sales to law enforcement agencies until federal regulations on use of facial recognition software are in force.Last week, noting the same concerns that led to these decisions, I wrote a post[1] questioning why U.S. national or state legislatures - seemly in thrall to police lobbies and 'law and order' shaming - hadn't placed some limits on the combination of constant surveillance and A.I.-based identity programs for law enforcement. While my comments still stand, at least the private sector has moved to limit the persistent drive toward a total surveillance state.So why the concern?I saw these headlines and thought, 'Wait a minute, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM all sell facial recognition software to the police? That's lots of firepower. Who else might be doing this?'We all know about Clearview AI[2]. This company has made it very clear that it will continue offering facial recognition services to anyone who pays, especially law enforcement. Japanese tech giant NEC just recommitted its salesforce to supplying U.S. law enforcement with facial recognition software according to the Wall Street Journal.[3] The same article notes that ''Most of the major companies that have the most contracts with law enforcement for facial recognition are smaller, specialized companies that most people have not heard of,' said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.' It then pinpoints Ayonix Corporation as another that has reaffirmed its plan to sell to police, along with iOmniscient and Herta Security LLC.Washington Post tech writer Geoffrey A. Fowler identifies Idemia as another major player in supplying biometric identification tech to law enforcement, and he echoes my call from last week writing[4], 'The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the tech is new laws.' We are both right about this sentiment, because we know how many companies are needed to provide the tools that law enforcement can use to intimidate a lawful assembly - just one.The only fix that will restrict this surveillance activity is to require warrants or other court permission - where the tech can only be used if there is at least a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. This would not be a burden on police. The ballooning population of surveillance cameras will continue to catch activity, but we need to restrict police from identifying every person they see on the footage, just because they want to do so. If there is a need, get a warrant, run the software, and identify that person holding a protest sign or walking across the street. If you can't establish a good reason to run the identifying software, don't do it.I have written repeatedly about the fact that the police will take as much leeway as our legislators are willing to give them. That is a reasonable position for law enforcement officer to take - use all resources at your disposal. But our current crisis with regard to intrusive surveillance tech in part arises from the fact that, since the Reagan years, but certainly post 9/11, no one in power has been willing to provide any reasonable limits on the reach of policing. Compared to twenty years ago, law enforcement has dozens of new tools at its fingertips, which have been popularized in a time when our society was not willing to put limits on how they could be used.The Post's Fowler seems more concerned that facial recognition technology does not work well for disadvantaged populations. I am most concerned about where the tech is working exactly as intended - stitching names to the faces in the crowd exercising their Constitutional rights to speech and assembly.But one of Fowler's other points is vital. The big tech companies may be taking their current stance to take pressure off of legislatures to regulate this industry. Some tech companies have already been active in proposing rules for surveillance tech that privacy activist see as watered down and ineffective. According to Jameson Spivack of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, the tech companies are 'lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections. But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used.'If you are want to see the effects of surveillance of protests without limits, observe the recent protests marches in Hong Kong against the deepening consolidation of single-state power in the territory. People are taking drastic countermeasures from full-body masking to pulling down the government's cameras, because they know what happens in the rest of China when the government identifies you as a troublemaker. Prison is a possible outcome, but so is government restriction on career, housing and other markers of a normal life.There is no need to take the comparison too far. The U.S. is not China. And this country may be awakening to an important way for emphasizing distinctions between the two societies - our democratically elected leaders are able to place restrictions on surveillance that the courts will enforce and the police will respect. We simply need the political will to act like a free democratic society and impose some requirements for legitimate law enforcement reasons to run powerful identification software on captured video.

Claypoole[1] Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP[2] HeyDataData[3] Last week's tech company announcements about facial recognition software startled me, but probably not for the reason you might imagine.Amazon, IBM and Microsoft all boosted their socially conscious credibility by moving to restrict local police and federal law enforcement use of their facial recognition technology for the near future. Their aim apparently is that more protesters can achieve the security by obscurity that most of us expect in crowds with less law enforcement bodies able to scan and identify individual protesters, or, even worse, identify all the protesters at a site.This is a good thing, right?New IBM CEO Arvid Krishna wrote to Congress about why IBM was proposing to break its government contracts, concerned that police would use the tech to violate basic human rights. Amazon used a company blog post to announce its own suspension of police access to Rekognition, its facial recognition software, for a year. </p><p>Microsoft then said it would suspend sales to law enforcement agencies until federal regulations on use of facial recognition software are in force.Last week, noting the same concerns that led to these decisions, Iwrote a post[4]questioning why U.S. national or state legislatures - seemly in thrall to police lobbies and 'law and order' shaming - hadn't placed some limits on the combination of constant surveillance and A.I.-based identity programs for law enforcement. While my comments still stand, at least the private sector has moved to limit the persistent drive toward a total surveillance state.So why the concern?I saw these headlines and thought, 'Wait a minute, Amazon, Microsoft and IBMallsell facial recognition software to the police? That's lots of firepower. Who else might be doing this?'We all know about Clearview AI[5]. This company has made it very clear that it will continue offering facial recognition services to anyone who pays, especially law enforcement. Japanese tech giant NEC just recommitted its salesforce to supplying U.S. law enforcement with facial recognition software according to theWall Street Journal.[6]The same article notes that ''Most of the major companies that have the most contracts with law enforcement for facial recognition are smaller, specialized companies that most people have not heard of,' said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.' It then pinpoints Ayonix Corporation as another that has reaffirmed its plan to sell to police, along with iOmniscient and Herta Security LLC.Washington Post tech writer Geoffrey A. Fowler identifies Idemia as another major player in supplying biometric identification tech to law enforcement, and he echoes my call from last weekwriting[7], 'The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the tech is new laws.' We are both right about this sentiment, because we know how many companies are needed to provide the tools that law enforcement can use to intimidate a lawful assembly - just one.The only fix that will restrict this surveillance activity is to require warrants or other court permission - where the tech can only be used if there is at least a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. This would not be a burden on police. The ballooning population of surveillance cameras will continue to catch activity, but we need to restrict police from identifying every person they see on the footage, just because they want to do so. If there is a need, get a warrant, run the software, and identify that person holding a protest sign or walking across the street. If you can't establish a good reason to run the identifying software, don't do it.I have written repeatedly about the fact that the police will take as much leeway as our legislators are willing to give them. That is a reasonable position for law enforcement officer to take - use all resources at your disposal. But our current crisis with regard to intrusive surveillance tech in part arises from the fact that, since the Reagan years, but certainly post 9/11, no one in power has been willing to provide any reasonable limits on the reach of policing. Compared to twenty years ago, law enforcement has dozens of new tools at its fingertips, which have been popularized in a time when our society was not willing to put limits on how they could be used.The Post's Fowler seems more concerned that facial recognition technology does not work well for disadvantaged populations. I am most concerned about where the tech is working exactly as intended - stitching names to the faces in the crowd exercising their Constitutional rights to speech and assembly.But one of Fowler's other points is vital.

But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used.'If you are want to see the effects of surveillance of protests without limits, observe the recent protests marches in Hong Kong against the deepening consolidation of single-state power in the territory. People are taking drastic countermeasures from full-body masking to pulling down the government's cameras, because they know what happens in the rest of China when the government identifies you as a troublemaker. Prison is a possible outcome, but so is government restriction on career, housing and other markers of a normal life.There is no need to take the comparison too far. The U.S. is not China. And this country may be awakening to an important way for emphasizing distinctions between the two societies - our democratically elected leaders are able to place restrictions on surveillance that the courts will enforce and the police will respect. We simply need the political will to act like a free democratic society and impose some requirements for legitimate law enforcement reasons to run powerful identification software on captured video.

The source went further, warning of the possibility of filling key cyber positions at the upper reaches of the executive branch with under-qualified supporters, as cyber policy officials return to the private sector after service in Trump's first term.</p><p>This source raised the specter that \"we might see a lot more cronies in Trump II, people who simply don't know about the jobs they're being given.\"</p><p>This is the first in an occasional series of analysis articles on the direction of cyber policy after the elections, examining the potential priorities of President Trump in a second term or those of a new Biden administration.</p><p>A Biden win</p><p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden has promised to put election security at the center of his agenda, including a call for an international \"Summit for Democracy\" to rally democratic allies around protecting electoral systems. He's also called for major investment in 5G -- a top Trump priority as well -- and artificial intelligence.</p><p>There probably would be few \"abrupt changes\" in the basics of U.S. cyber policy under a President Biden, a former high-ranking cybersecurity official said. But \"the first thing I'd advise them to do is review everything done under executive action over the past four years.\"</p><p>The presidential orders and directives on supply-chain issues under Trump have \"really been a blunt tool for market access\" aimed at China, and would be ripe for review and revision under a Biden administration, the source said. Further, the source said to expect a much greater focus on \"multilateralism\" in the development of cyber policy.</p><p>Another policy veteran with experience at the White House level said, \"I do think if Biden wins, you'll see efforts on data privacy -- and I don't actually think you'll see any big efforts on breaking up Big Tech. If Biden wins, I think you could also see a re-engagement internationally on global standards and greater emphasis on multi-nation alliances on cybersecurity. You may also see increased efforts on election security.\"</p><p>A Biden administration could bring a major push on data security and privacy legislation, and perhaps executive action in those areas, though tensions are certain to remain over federal versus state authority. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has been a strong advocate of her home state's work on this topic and as vice president could push for that to be a floor in any federal legislation.</p><p>There is a pent-up demand among congressional Democrats to craft a national privacy/data security regime along the lines of the California standards or European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. This could kick off the most high-profile legislative action on cyber since 2015.</p><p>Under Biden, there could be executive action -- and definitely would be congressional moves -- to create an empowered cybersecurity director in the White House, with an eye toward more centralized and coordinated policymaking on cybersecurity. This has major implications for regulatory policy toward the energy, communications, finance, technology and other key sectors.</p><p>A Biden victory would bring many familiar faces back into senior positions in government, as veterans of the Obama administration probably flesh out the senior ranks on cybersecurity. That promises continuity in policy, but also strong views among the incoming team on areas where industry-led efforts are working and where more government guidance -- read, regulation -- is needed.</p><p>\"I do believe you will see a lot of familiar faces -- and if we are lucky -- we may even see some Republicans,\" one source commented.</p><p>This source observed that former Google leader Eric Schmidt is heading up a Biden policy team on technology policy. \"I also agree it will be a more Allied approach\" to key cyber policy issues, the source said.</p><p>Biden is pledging a tough policy toward China but it would probably include significant departures from the current policy including more coordination with allies and going beyond the current company-by-company bans on Chinese firms.</p><p>The 2020 Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommendations as well as the 2016 report of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity will probably offer blueprints for the Biden team.</p><p>Amid recent controversies engulfing DHS, a Biden win could bring a major effort to reorganize the department, perhaps with new independence and authority for the cyber agency.</p><p>A Biden administration would likely shift the U.S. government's effort to counter disinformation into its own policy channel, rather than as an aspect of cybersecurity, according to a source. This channel would probably be managed from the State Department, whereas State, Defense and Homeland Security are all active on the topic right now. It would also require re-establishing resources at State that have been cut in recent years, the source said.</p><p>A Trump re-election</p><p>The Trump administration, Act Two, would bring a new cast of players to key policy positions, with different takes on cyber priorities.</p><p>But the basic arc of cyber policy development would likely continue, with an emphasis on new technologies to meet cyber challenges, such as Open RAN as a way to both improve security and beat China in the 5G race.</p><p>Telecom would continue to be ground zero in the intertwined trade and security battle with China. The FCC would likely continue taking regulatory actions to counter Chinese companies while a newly empowered interdepartmental Team Telecom tries to coordinate strategies and actions to secure U.S. systems.</p><p>\"If we have Trump II, we'll see an acceleration of supply-chain efforts and the Clean Networks Initiative, all to get China out of our systems,\" said the former high-ranking government cyber official. \"It will start with telecom and move to the electricity sector.\"</p><p>This source said to watch for who succeeds Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary -- assuming Ross steps down after one term -- as Commerce has been a central player in the supply-chain efforts. And, the source said, keep an eye on tensions between the Trump White House and Pentagon over cyber and other priorities, noting that policy disagreements have quietly emerged in the context of this year's debate over the National Defense Authorization Act.</p><p>The Trump administration has also been looking closely at areas like electric grid security, an area where a stronger regulatory hand could appear during a second term. And there will be ongoing efforts to modernize technology both for the federal government and at the state level.</p><p>In the global arena, one source asked, \"With the UAE/Israel alliance, could we see more coordinated efforts in cybersecurity against Iran?\"</p><p>Issues in transition</p><p>The period from Election Day until the Jan. 20 swearing-in will bring either the gradual introduction of a new Democratic administration or the expected exodus and replacement of senior officials in the Trump administration.</p><p>Shortly after Jan. 20, there could be executive actions in areas like privacy and data security under Biden, and more steps toward China, perhaps under either administration. A Trump team also could issue orders to secure federal networks early in a new term, and perhaps on grid security.</p><p>Under either administration, new cyber initiatives are likely to emerge based on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is already taking the lead in this space. \"We are likely to see CISA position itself with increased authority and responsibility,\" a source noted.</p><p>Leadership of CISA will be a major question during the transition, whoever wins the White House. Director Christopher Krebs appears likely to leave, meaning CISA is in line to get the second director in its history.</p><p>One source said Bryan Ware would likely stay on at DHS and may become the CISA Director in a second Trump term. Under Ware, the source suggested, \"you will see more movement similar to the [recent] critical infrastructure announcement as he will look to centralize shared services and technology within CISA and be responsible for it.\" -- Charlie Mitchell (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cmitchell@iwpnews.com\">cmitchell@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICSRTY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICSRTY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P2-D7R1-DY0P-G0NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412529</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Cyber Security</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000C4AX</classCode><className>PERSONNEL CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMX1</classCode><className>CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000938</classCode><className>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp;

Now that Google Inc. is officially taking bids for its much-hyped initial public offering of stock, it could be my chance to get lucky.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But how much to bid, and for how many shares?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To try and chronicle Google's IPO through the eyes of an average investor, the boss agreed to give me $1,000 of Cox Newspapers' money to join in the fun.</p><p>Any profits, we agreed, will be donated to charity. Any losses hopefully won't affect my employment.</p><p>Like everything about the Web search engine company, Google's $3 billion IPO is unconventional.</p><p>Instead of simply setting an IPO price and selling stock, Google set an \"expected\" range of $108 to $135 for its more than 25 million shares. Prospective investors must submit bids for what they're willing to pay.</p><p>Sometime early next week, Google executives will examine the bids and announce a final offering price. Anybody who bid at or above that price gets to buy shares. Anybody who bid lower is out of luck.</p><p>By using this modified \"Dutch auction\" process, Google hopes to make the IPO process simpler and more democratic, letting little guys like me into a world that up until now was the near-exclusive domain of deep-pocketed venture capitalists and Wall Street investment bankers.</p><p>Since that system used to give the bankers IPO stock at a discount, much to the benefit of big customers and cronies who were cut into the deal, the auction also helps Google squeeze every nickel of value out of its offering.</p><p>Before even getting to the point of figuring out what to bid, I had to leap some unexpected hurdles, ranging from getting a bidder ID to filling out an \"eligibility\" form listing my investing experience and assets. While many small-time investors were apparently found \"ineligible,\" I wasn't one of them. Lucky already, I thought.</p><p>I also had to get some money to my brokerage company, Ameritrade - and quick, since until a few days ago nobody knew exactly when bidding would open. That took a $20 wire fee and a trip to the bank.</p><p>All along, I kept thinking: What to bid?</p><p>My trials in the run-up to the IPO were nothing compared to final-stretch snafus at Google.</p><p>There was the news that California regulators were investigating whether the company may have illegally sold shares to employees.</p><p>Then came the announcement that rival Yahoo Inc. was settling a patent lawsuit, but only if Google gave it nearly 3 million shares of its stock.</p><p>Then Playboy magazine hit the stands, featuring an interview with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The company had to issue a warning that the Securities and Exchange Commission might decide that the article violated the \"quiet period\" that companies are supposed to observe when big stock offerings are pending.</p><p>Despite all that, Google and its designated brokerage firms started taking bids Friday morning.</p><p>I was back to my underlying question: What to bid?</p><p>I tried to think like an individual investor. I re-read Google's 125-page-plus prospectus. I looked for research on the Web and read as much about the company that I could stand.</p><p>Then I did what any astute investor might do. I asked my neighbor, the stockbroker, for advice.</p><p>\"I wouldn't spend a dime on it,\" he said, warning of the unusualness of the IPO, Google's short history and the expensive bid range.</p><p>But this is my job, I told him, and went back to pondering: What to bid?</p><p>That's when I started trying to think how Google's executives, who will have ultimate say over the final IPO price, might be thinking.</p><p>When I met Brin a year or so at the company's headquarters, he rolled in on his weird Segway personal transporter. I had lunch with other \"Googlers\" in the big tent out back. I admired the corporate Lava lamp collection.</p><p>Even without visiting the \"Googleplex,\" anybody knows that this company and its executives thrive on being cute and clever, right down to the kitschy themed cartoons Google uses to adorn its Web site - on Friday, as opening ceremonies for the Summer Olympic Games were being held, it was Greek gods.</p><p>That's when I decided what to bid.</p><p>My offer: $123.45 per share, a numerical series for a company named after a number.</p><p>That's well within Google's recommended range and lets me buy the minimum five shares required under IPO rules without busting my budget.</p><p>It's also within the only forecast for an eventual valuation range that I could find, the $121 to $127 per share suggested by credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</p><p>I was tempted to place my bid of $123.45 for six shares, just to out-cutesy those clever Googlers. But I remembered some things I read about the company's history.</p><p>Google was founded Sept. 7, 1998. It got its first big round of venture-capital funding June 7, 1999.</p><p>There must be something to the digit 7, I thought. At the very least, the innate luckiness of the number 7 might help offset the unluckiness of the date of my bid, Friday the 13th.</p><p>Besides, while I could've afforded eight shares, I wanted enough of the bosses' $1,000 left to pay for brokerage and wire fees, and for some celebratory Mai Tais to mark my entry into tech moguldom.</p><p>So there it was. I placed my bid for $123.45 for seven shares Friday afternoon.</p><p>Now I have to wait until next week, when Google will announce the highest price that will encompass bidders for all 25.7 million shares. Soon after, GOOG stock will begin trading on the NASDAQ exchange.</p><p>If I get in, and the IPO performs like Netscape's 168 percent first-day gain, my $1,000 might be worth more than $2,300.</p><p>Of course, plenty of financial analysts have warned about expecting big gains from this IPO. Many warn the price range suggested by Google is far too high. And recent history, of course, is filled with failed tech companies that had promising IPOS - including Netscape.</p><p>Even the stock registration form that Google filed with the Securities Exchange Commission lists about 60 specific risks and other warnings to investors, from the fierce competition in the online business to the dangers of fluctuating currency exchange rates.</p><p>But forget all that.</p><p>I'm feeling lucky.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAYDNW-0408160180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAYDNW2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D5C-3PG0-0027-X2X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144574</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Dayton Daily News (Ohio)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Dayton Newspapers, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>August 15, 2004 Sunday CITY EDITION</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>GOOGLE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0YAHOO!

And it's one that's only going to add more fuel to the fire when it comes to ACCC boss Rod Sims's task of bringing it to heel.</p><p>Acquiring power Parent company Alphabet consists of not only Google but a range of businesses spanning autonomous driving, drones, home -internet and artificial intelligence. Google has become so powerful that it's a verb in the dictionary and is so ubiquitous that to some less experienced internet users, it is the internet.</p><p>News Corp, owner of The Australian, says in its submission to the ACCC, published yesterday: \"Google enjoys overwhelming market power in both online search and ad tech services, and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of consumers, -advertisers and publishers.</p><p>\"While News Corp Australia recognises that divestment is a very serious step \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 divestment is necessary in the case of Google, due to the unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.\"</p><p>Joining the fight Spinning off Google's search engine business is a position that's more mainstream than you'd think, and extends across the -political divide.</p><p>US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren this week unveiled a plan to break up the US tech -giants. She did so onstage at the South by Southwest tech festival in Austin, Texas, where the audience - which included members of those very tech companies - spontaneously broke out into chants of \"Break Them Up\".</p><p>Warren compared the situation to baseball.</p><p>\"You can be the umpire; that's like the platform,\" the Democrat said. \"Or you can own the team; that's one of the businesses. But you don't get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.\" Republicans, too, are joining the fight. Prominent senator Orrin Hatch has called on the US Federal Trade Commission to- look into anti-competitive effects from Google's dominance in -online ads and search.</p><p>Warren said at SXSW that the tech giants are competing -unfairly, given they're eating up smaller rival start-ups and are not -allowing healthy competition. Google has acquired more than 200 start-ups since it was founded, including products used by millions of Australians every day, -including YouTube and mobile operating system Android.</p><p>Warren said: \"Look at it this way, someone like Amazon runs a platform - you know, the place where you buy your coffee maker and get it delivered in 48 hours, and that's great.</p><p>\"But in -addition to that, they're sucking up all that information about every purchase, every sale and every one of the other little businesses that are offering their products on Amazon.\" She said her position was not one of socialism but one that is compatible with capitalism. \"I believe in markets - markets that work,\" she said.</p><p>\"Markets that have a cop on the beat and have real rules and everybody follows them. I believe in a level playing field.\"</p><p>Dominant player News Corp agrees, saying Google's conduct reveals a pattern of avoiding and undermining regulatory initiatives and ignoring private contractual arrangement.</p><p>The company also wants a level playing field, saying any market in which the dominant player is responsible not only for 90 per cent of web searches but also the news we read and what advertising we are -exposed to is not level.</p><p>The company says: \"While we recognise that the truly global nature of digital platforms like Google mean that some of the proposed remedies in this submission may require some co-ordination among governments internationally to be truly effective, we do not believe the ACCC should shy away from taking -action or making such recommendations.\" The collective might of Google, Facebook and Amazon, in particular, are especially worrying at a time when Australians are connecting smart devices to their homes in record numbers. Everything from smart fridges to light bulbs and Fitbits are now tracking every move and word uttered.</p><p>Analyst firm Telsyte predicts there will be 311 million connected devices in homes across Australia by 2021, devices that by and large will be connected back to the US tech giants, feeding them -precious data about our most intimate -details.</p><p>Big tech fights back The calls have been met with a predictable backlash by the tech -giants themselves.</p><p>Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom told the SXSW conference there are many legitimate reasons people are upset with tech firms, including Russian meddling in elections and higher rents near tech hubs.</p><p>\"We live in a time where I think the anger against big tech has -increased tenfold. That doesn't mean that the answer is breaking the companies up,\" Systrom said.</p><p>\"My fear is that a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone's current feeling about anti-tech, rather than doing what politicians should do, which is -address real problems with real -solutions.\" The difference between the discourse in the US and News Corp's proposals is that the ACCC's proposals are very real, and the -regulator has a very real opportunity to curb the influence of the tech -giants that are now too big to fail.</p><p>Such a move would have -precedent.</p><p>In the US in 1902, president Teddy Roosevelt sued Northern Securities Company, a railroad trust financed by the country's two most powerful businessmen, JP Morgan and John D. -Rockefeller, accused of restraint of trade.</p><p>In one of the first anti-trust cases in history, the US Supreme Court agreed with Roosevelt and the company was dismantled.</p><p>In 1911, US president William Howard Taft broke Rocke-feller's Standard Oil empire into 34 separate companies after the US -Supreme Court ruled the company violated anti-trust laws.</p><p>Closer to home and more -recently, Telstra has undergone a structural separation since 2012, in partnership with the ACCC.</p><p>In a move designed to promote competition, Telstra is splitting its network and retail operations amid a shift to the NBN.</p><p>It's a process that is costing Telstra billions in revenue but it will mean more choice and likely cheaper connectivity for consumers over the long term.</p><p>Customer outcomes aside, there's also the question of what a potential tech breakup would look like. As renowned US tech investor and an early backer of Facebook, Roger McNamee, suggested last year, Google should be broken up into eight or 10 different -monopolies.</p><p>\"I'm OK with Google being a monopolist in search,\" McNamee told CNBC. \"What I don't want them to do is to use that power to eliminate pricing engines in -Europe. I don't want them to use it to make their photo search and all these other things.\"</p><p>Fine line It sounds wise in theory, and the unfettered power exercised by Google and the likes of Facebook and Amazon is in need of containment; however, regulators will have to draw a fine line when it comes to balancing enforcement with any detrimental fallout on consumers.</p><p>As the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, told The Australian recently, a heavy-handed approach from governments won't necessarily guarantee success.</p><p>The tech giants are powerful but, as Sir Tim said, they do provide useful services, so breaking up big tech would need to be done carefully.</p><p>\"Companies like Google, Facebook use your data for advertising, which on one hand is very effective and useful for consumers,\" Sir Tim said.</p><p>\"Clearly, there are places where we need change but this is not just about technology, there's a people problem here as well.\" For the ACCC to begin breaking up the tech giants would be a bold step and one that would -require persistent work and -international co-operation.</p><p>As persistent as Google and Facebook have been with hoovering up our data and controlling our online lives, any move to counter their market power would need equal dedication.If anyone is up to the task, it is Sims and his team of regulators. Whether they have the appetite is another question.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-84a56eb0448211e9a46a61f56c71df4b9a2cb85431fb66b9f4c2881f7ed9f0e7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMF-BF71-F0JP-W3F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

And it's one that's only going to add more fuel to the fire when it comes to ACCC boss Rod Sims's task of bringing it to heel.</p><p>Acquiring power Parent company Alphabet consists of not only Google but a range of businesses spanning autonomous driving, drones, home -internet and artificial intelligence. Google has become so powerful that it's a verb in the dictionary and is so ubiquitous that to some less experienced internet users, it is the internet.</p><p>News Corp, owner of The Australian, says in its submission to o the ACCC, published yesterday: \"Google enjoys overwhelming market power in both online search and ad tech services, and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of consumers, -advertisers and publishers.</p><p>\"While News Corp Australia recognises that divestment is a very serious step \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 divestment is necessary in the case of Google, due to the unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.\"</p><p>Joining the fight Spinning off Google's search engine business is a position that's more mainstream than you'd think, and extends across the -political divide.</p><p>US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren this week unveiled a plan to break up the US tech -giants. She did so onstage at the South by Southwest tech festival in Austin, Texas, where the audience - which included members of those very tech companies - spontaneously broke out into chants of \"Break Them Up\".</p><p>Warren compared the situation to baseball.</p><p>\"You can be the umpire; that's like the platform,\" the Democrat said. \"Or you can own the team; that's one of the businesses. But you don't get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.\" Republicans, too, are joining the fight. Prominent senator Orrin Hatch has called on the US Federal Trade Commission to- look into anti-competitive effects from Google's dominance in -online ads and search.</p><p>Warren said at SXSW that the tech giants are competing -unfairly, given they're eating up smaller rival start-ups and are not -allowing healthy competition. Google has acquired more than 200 start-ups since it was founded, including products used by millions of Australians every day, -including YouTube and mobile operating system Android.</p><p>Warren said: \"Look at it this way, someone like Amazon runs a platform - you know, the place where you buy your coffee maker and get it delivered in 48 hours, and that's great.</p><p>\"But in -addition to that, they're sucking up all that information about every purchase, every sale and every one of the other little businesses that are offering their products on Amazon.\" She said her position was not one of socialism but one that is compatible with capitalism. \"I believe in markets - markets that work,\" she said.</p><p>\"Markets that have a cop on the beat and have real rules and everybody follows them. I believe in a level playing field.\"</p><p>Dominant player News Corp agrees, saying Google's conduct reveals a pattern of avoiding and undermining regulatory initiatives and ignoring private contractual arrangement.</p><p>The company also wants a level playing field, saying any market in which the dominant player is responsible not only for 90 per cent of web searches but also the news we read and what advertising we are -exposed to is not level.</p><p>The company says: \"While we recognise that the truly global nature of digital platforms like Google mean that some of the proposed remedies in this submission may require some co-ordination among governments internationally to be truly effective, we do not believe the ACCC should shy away from taking -action or making such recommendations.\" The collective might of Google, Facebook and Amazon, in particular, are especially worrying at a time when Australians are connecting smart devices to their homes in record numbers. Everything from smart fridges to light bulbs and Fitbits are now tracking every move and word uttered.</p><p>Analyst firm Telsyte predicts there will be 311 million connected devices in homes across Australia by 2021, devices that by and large will be connected back to the US tech giants, feeding them -precious data about our most intimate -details.</p><p>Big tech fights back The calls have been met with a predictable backlash by the tech -giants themselves.</p><p>Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom told the SXSW conference there are many legitimate reasons people are upset with tech firms, including Russian meddling in elections and higher rents near tech hubs.</p><p>\"We live in a time where I think the anger against big tech has -increased tenfold. That doesn't mean that the answer is breaking the companies up,\" Systrom said.</p><p>\"My fear is that a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone's current feeling about anti-tech, rather than doing what politicians should do, which is -address real problems with real -solutions.\" The difference between the discourse in the US and News Corp's proposals is that the ACCC's proposals are very real, and the -regulator has a very real opportunity to curb the influence of the tech -giants that are now too big to fail.</p><p>Such a move would have -precedent.</p><p>In the US in 1902, president Teddy Roosevelt sued Northern Securities Company, a railroad trust financed by the country's two most powerful businessmen, JP Morgan and John D. -Rockefeller, accused of restraint of trade.</p><p>In one of the first anti-trust cases in history, the US Supreme Court agreed with Roosevelt and the company was dismantled.</p><p>In 1911, US president William Howard Taft broke Rocke-feller's Standard Oil empire into 34 separate companies after the US -Supreme Court ruled the company violated anti-trust laws.</p><p>Closer to home and more -recently, Telstra has undergone a structural separation since 2012, in partnership with the ACCC.</p><p>In a move designed to promote competition, Telstra is splitting its network and retail operations amid a shift to the NBN.</p><p>It's a process that is costing Telstra billions in revenue but it will mean more choice and likely cheaper connectivity for consumers over the long term.</p><p>Customer outcomes aside, there's also the question of what a potential tech breakup would look like. As renowned US tech investor and an early backer of Facebook, Roger McNamee, suggested last year, Google should be broken up into eight or 10 different -monopolies.</p><p>\"I'm OK with Google being a monopolist in search,\" McNamee told CNBC. \"What I don't want them to do is to use that power to eliminate pricing engines in -Europe. I don't want them to use it to make their photo search and all these other things.\"</p><p>Fine line It sounds wise in theory, and the unfettered power exercised by Google and the likes of Facebook and Amazon is in need of containment; however, regulators will have to draw a fine line when it comes to balancing enforcement with any detrimental fallout on consumers.</p><p>As the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, told The Australian recently, a heavy-handed approach from governments won't necessarily guarantee success.</p><p>The tech giants are powerful but, as Sir Tim said, they do provide useful services, so breaking up big tech would need to be done carefully.</p><p>\"Companies like Google, Facebook use your data for advertising, which on one hand is very effective and useful for consumers,\" Sir Tim said.</p><p>\"Clearly, there are places where we need change but this is not just about technology, there's a people problem here as well.\" For the ACCC to begin breaking up the tech giants would be a bold step and one that would -require persistent work and -international co-operation.</p><p>As persistent as Google and Facebook have been with hoovering up our data and controlling our online lives, any move to counter their market power would need equal dedication.If anyone is up to the task, it is Sims and his team of regulators. Whether they have the appetite is another question.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-84a56eb0448211e9a46a61f56c71df4b07aed9ab72d08d3ddc9b05d64d23cc93</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-HGC1-JD3N-516D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

In its latest sting, the European Commission has slapped Google with an eye-watering \u20ac4.3 billion (AU$6.8 billion) fine for anti-competitive tying of its Android operating system to its in-house search engine and web browser. The decision follows the Commission's \u20ac2.4 billion (AU$3.5 billion) fine against the company for giving illegal advantage to its comparison shopping service , just over a year ago. And the search company is not alone in feeling the heat from Brussels. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have all been on the receiving end of what some see as a ' techlash ' reflecting anti-US bias and protectionism. </p><p>So far, US competition authorities have taken a far more restrained approach. The Federal Trade Commission looked into various Google practices in 2012 and found it had no case to raise around search bias . Antitrust officials are instead encouraging vigilance but caution when it comes to intervening in data-driven markets characterised by high rates of innovation. Closer to home, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is conducting an inquiry into the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising markets . It is attracting intense interest, not just here but abroad. There are also reports of the ACCC separately investigating Google's data-harvesting practices . Read more: What consumers need from the ACCC inquiry into Google and Facebook Will the ACCC follow the US or European approach? It is tempting to speculate about the outcomes of the inquiry in those terms, but to do so would be a mistake. There are differences in the substantive laws across jurisdictions. The Australian rule on misuse of market power , for example, is not an exact replica of either its US or EU counterpart. What's more, the law in any country can only be understood by considering its ideological roots, the political and socio-cultural conditions in which it is shaped, and the institutional framework that determines its application. In other words, history and context matter. Divergence between the US and European Union on how to deal with large powerful companies is nothing new and, in context, not all that surprising. In the US competition is about consumer welfare US antitrust laws were introduced in response to the economic and political power of 'big business' and what was seen as a need to protect the 'little guy' from a few ' robber barons '. US antitrust laws were created to prevent big companies from dominating the market. Shutterstock However, since the 1970s, under the influence of the Chicago school , commitment to economic efficiency in the interests of consumer welfare has become the singular goal of antitrust. In practice, this has meant agencies and courts have stressed a ground rule of trusting markets to self-correct and erring on the side of false negatives rather than false positives. Where there is intervention, it is to protect competition and not competitors. In recent times, there has been growing dissatisfaction in some circles about the levels of concentration in the US economy and the role that permissive antitrust has played in creating so-called 'data-opolies' . Nevertheless, Chicagoan themes continue to underpin self-restraint on the part of US antitrust agencies, including when it comes to big tech. In Europe fairness counts too While EU competition laws are also concerned about the consumer, they are more pluralistic in their approach. This reflects their experience in the aftermath of the second world war, and the single market project . EU-style antitrust has therefore always been based on - and continues to reflect - more normative values than the US, protecting ideas like economic freedom and fairness. Fairness in this context, however, is not necessarily about protecting the losers from a legitimate competitive process. It is about protecting the right to equal opportunities for efficient competitors, or merit-based competition on a level playing field. It is also about ensuring fairness for consumers. Anti-competitive conduct, the European competition boss argues, is unfair because it deprives consumers of the power to arbitrate the marketplace. Australian competition law has its own flavour Born in the late 1970s, the modern version of Australian competition law has followed the Chicagoan song sheet, favouring economic efficiency for consumer welfare as its primary purpose. However, in a relatively small economy, marked by oligopolistic structures and high concentration in key sectors, Australia has always struggled with a balancing act between promoting efficiency and protecting small business. 'Fair competition' (a version of the iconic 'fair go' ) is a phrase often heard in Australian competition law dialect. But it is not to be confused with propping up inefficient rivals at the expense of competition. Unlike in many other countries, Australia's competition rules live within a statute that also has rules to deal separately with ensuring small businesses and consumers are treated fairly . Read more: Australia's consumer laws still don't cover e-books and many other digital products Under the Competition and Consumer Act , the competition, fair trading and consumer protection provisions are mutually reinforcing. Also unlike in either the US or EU, these provisions are enforced by a single agency, the ACCC. Distinctive too is that the ACCC is an agency with substantial regulatory responsibilities in areas including communications and infrastructure. These may be relevant in a debate about whether powerful tech companies should be regulated like public utilities on the grounds that they provide services that are essential to consumers. The ACCC's inquiry will be holistic Given this legislative and institutional framework, the ACCC's take on big tech is likely to be a mix of US and EU approaches with more than a dash of homemade seasoning. Competition It will consider if platforms have market power, in which markets, and how such power is being exercised. Implications for the price, quality and choice of news for consumers will loom large. It will consider what impact the proposed consumer right to data may have. Consumer protection It will also examine whether platforms are providing users with adequate levels of privacy and data protection. Fair trading The ACCC will look into whether the large platforms are behaving in a way that dampens innovation and investment incentives for start ups and smaller players. Regulation There will be consideration of whether platforms have an unfair advantage because the regulatory playing field is not even. Regulation of journalistic content and copyright will also come into play. Read more: News outlets air grievances and Facebook plays the underdog in ACCC inquiry Most importantly, the inquiry will not be static in its focus. It will have a firm eye on potential long term trends in and impacts of technological change within an Australian context. Within a broad holistic framework, the ACCC will examine these questions in an integrated way. And will take its time to ' get the answers right '. A version of this article appears on Pursuit .

As Europe's competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what interests Ms. Vestager about the transaction is not the amount of money at stake, but the amount of data. In a rapidly expanding information economy, she believes the control of data is a new regulatory frontier. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''We're really making an effort to understand the different laws of data -- how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,'' Ms. Vestager said in an interview. ''What will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?''</p><p>  If not a household name in the United States, Ms. Vestager, 50 and a native of Denmark, is perhaps the world's most famous (or infamous, depending on where you stand) regulator. She has spent the past four years investigating American tech firms, finding them wanting and ordering them to pay billions of dollars in fines and back taxes.</p><p>  Her rulings against Apple, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm have positioned the European Union, rather than Washington, as the world's de facto Big Tech regulator -- and established Ms. Vestager as an international regulatory celebrity, if such a thing is not an oxymoron. She helped to inspire the lead character in a Danish television series. Crowds flock to hear her speak.</p><p>  ''Europe is acting to enforce antitrust laws where the U.S. is not,'' said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, who feels that American regulators dropped the ball when they decided not to pursue a case against Google in 2013 (Yelp is a longtime Google antagonist). ''Ironically, many of the complainants in the E.U. antitrust case against Google are U.S. companies, pursuing justice in Europe precisely because the U.S., has not acted,'' he said in an email.</p><p>  While Ms. Vestager's global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.</p><p>  Though a long shot, Ms. Vestager is among the potential contenders for president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. It is the most powerful job in the bloc -- one never held by a woman, or by someone with her public profile.</p><p>  Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.</p><p>  Critics of Ms. Vestager include leaders of American tech companies who have crossed her and who take issue with both her approach and her facts; Republicans in Congress; some members of the Trump administration; the Wall Street Journal editorial board; and groups like the Business Roundtable, a conservative-leaning, pro-business collection of American chief executives.</p><p>Apple is especially aggrieved. In 2016, Ms. Vestager ordered Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros in back taxes, or about $15.5 billion, saying that the company had illegally received a tax break that was not available to others. Apple has begun paying the money into an escrow account, but both the company and Ireland have appealed the decision. They say it ignores how much tax Apple has already paid to Ireland, misrepresents the tax rate the company is subject to there, and reflects either a willful misreading or an ignorance of tax law.</p><p>  Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.</p><p>  ''I think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,'' said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.</p><p>  Both Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief, have traveled to Brussels to argue their cases in person, apparently in vain. Last June, Ms. Vestager fined Google ?2.4 billion, or about $2.8 billion, after concluding that it had unfairly used its search engine to favor its services over those of its rivals. It was the largest such penalty in the European Commission's history, and more than double similar fines levied by the United States.</p><p>  Last May, she fined Facebook ?110 million, or about $131 million, after concluding that it had misled the European authorities about its acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp. And in January, she fined the American chip maker Qualcomm ?997 million, or about $1.2 billion, saying it had abused its market dominance to shut out competitors.</p><p>  For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users' personal information.</p><p>  As the top European official enforcing competition laws, Ms. Vestager has primarily concentrated on how a range of companies use, or abuse, their market dominance. But she has also emerged as a major voice of warning about the effect of tech firms on our habits, our privacy, our ability to make human connections and even democracy itself. (Europe has a new data privacy law that is to take effect May 25.)</p><p>  ''What's fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,'' said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p><p>  He added: ''I believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we're seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.''</p><p>  Appearing last November at a tech summit meeting in Lisbon, Ms. Vestager was interviewed onstage by Kara Swisher, host of the Recode Decode podcast, as about 15,000 people looked on. Many in the audience were young techies who greeted the commissioner with something like euphoria, particularly when she declared that ''we need to take our democracy back'' from social media.</p><p>  ''She's what my generation looks for in a politician,'' said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: ''The moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She's the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.''</p><p>  Other jurisdictions are following Europe's regulatory lead. Brazil, among other countries, has begun an antitrust case against Google, and one of the search giant's Brazilian competitors said last summer that it would use the European arguments in its own lawsuit. And in November, the state of Missouri opened an investigation into whether Google violated the state's antitrust and consumer protection laws.</p><p>  ''It's good if we can inspire each other globally,'' Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.</p><p>  She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)</p><p>  Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She's not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a ''Believe in God, fear the church'' philosophy.)</p><p>  She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party's parliamentary leader six years later -- she was already national chairwoman -- and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.</p><p>  ''She was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,'' said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.</p><p>  As for the boring part: ''She has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,'' Ms. Svane said in an interview. ''The party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.''</p><p>  Ms. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs -- even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.</p><p>  ''All of us have multiple selves,'' she said. ''Being a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.'' She learned to smile more, she said, ''to be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.''</p><p>  Her party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits -- forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises -- while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.</p><p>  She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was ''a reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.''</p><p>  In 2014, Denmark made her the country's appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.</p><p>  Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama ''Borgen,'' struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager's husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.</p><p>  ''Here, it's more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,'' she said. ''I have sometimes been asked if I'm a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, 'They don't know any different -- this is the mother they've got.'''</p><p>  Lately she has been thinking about power -- what it is, who has it, how it is used -- after reading the historian Mary Beard's latest book, ''Women and Power.'' ''The #MeToo movement can be maybe the most important catalyst for decades in doing that,'' Ms. Vestager said. ''It tears down our understanding of power.</p><p>  ''Power is not something you own,'' she continued.

Recent works from activists, academics, polemicists and techies have contributed toward a flourishing genre. But a wealthy investor making a pile from Facebook, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">then</emphasis> finding religion sounds a bit, um, rich. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In \"Zucked,\" Roger McNamee winces at the memory of his introduction to Mark Zuckerberg. It was 2006 and he played the grizzled industry elder to Zuckerberg's tyro. Beware suitors bearing mucho cash, he intoned. Stay true to yourself. If he was expecting a high-five or \"hell, yeah!\" he had another think coming.</p><p>Like the interminable latency of an app struggling to load, five agonizing minutes elapsed, during which Zuckerberg struck sundry postures from Rodin's \"The Thinker\" before he responded, McNamee recounts. Awkward? It was excruciating. But it turned out they were on the same page - Zuckerberg wasn't for selling Facebook - and the encounter marked the beginning of a bounteous relationship: McNamee hooked Zuckerberg up with a friend named Sheryl Sandberg to help turn Facebook into a business; Zuckerberg cut McNamee into Facebook's early funding rounds. McNamee bowed out of his informal advisory role in 2009, but retained sufficient goodwill that when he emailed \"Zuck and Sheryl\" in 2016 with a hunch about Russian mischief, they replied promptly, if only to fob him off with a VP.</p><p>\"Zucked\" chronicles McNamee's move into open breach with Facebook: digging into its ransacking of user privacy, agitating for congressional action, huddling with George Soros to prep him for a speech at Davos calling for big tech to be brought to heel.</p><p>Thus, it can be read as an account of the adventures in activism - very 2019 - of a rich guy. But, written from the perspective of an ex-evangelist steeped in industry lore, \"Zucked\" lands crucial insights into how a firm that seemed a force for unalloyed good - connection with one another - became a scourge.</p><p>From 2012 to 2017, Facebook went on a tear, McNamee writes. \"The company experimented constantly with algorithms, new data types, and small changes in design, measuring everything. Every action a user took gave Facebook a better understanding of that user - and of that user's friends - enabling the company to make tiny improvements in the 'user experience' ... which is to say they got better at manipulating the attention of users. ... Before long, Fakebook's surveillance capabilities rivaled those of an intelligence agency.\"</p><p>The prospects for reform from within are remote. The simplicity of Facebook's business - \"a product and . monetization scheme\" - have concentrated power in the hands of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. Both are concerned chiefly with avoiding splatter from scandals on their personal brands and heedless of criticism, writes McNamee.</p><p>This and the neologism he minted for the title of this book hardly augur well. How can we un-Zuck ourselves?</p><p>McNamee prescribes government-supported \"civically-responsible social media\" and regulation, including the possibility of \"breaking up Facebook and Google.\" If this sounds drastic, it's all in how you frame it: \"In the realm of technology, what will we give up to protect democracy?\"</p><p>Our relationship with technology has \"inverted,\" he concludes - we've become its tools. Harking back to Steve Jobs' formulation of the computer as \"bicycle for the mind,\" we must restore \"human-driven technology.\"</p><p>The same preoccupation with reasserting human control over technology animates Douglas Rushkoff's \"Team Human,\" a trenchant take-back-the-web manifesto retailed in 100 mini-essays. Rushkoff's take: We've become enmeshed in the inhuman logic of a system arranged for the convenience of artificial intelligence and outsize profits for the few.</p><p>Exhibit A in his argument is currency, not crypto but the tokens exchanged among medieval merchants - a lubricant to trade that promised to spread the wealth before nobles co-opted the idea with a centralized currency and restricted access to commercial activity by royal decree. </p><p>This sounds far removed from Facebook, but the dynamic - the possibility for human agency and empowerment squelched by elite power grab - has played out in new media since, writes Rushkoff; for instance TV and radio, conceived for connection and education, but captured by advertisers and propagandists bent on \"instrumentalizing\" our attention to convert us to their agendas. Then came the internet. Rushkoff was a cyberpunk, and he writes ecstatically of the early web: \"We were witnessing the first synaptic transmissions of a collective organism attempting to reach new levels of connectedness and wake itself up.\" </p><p>But the dot-commers crashed the scene. Where \"hippies and hackers\" saw \"Gaia,\" Wall Street carpetbaggers eyed online real estate to unlock shareholder value and remade the web in the image of TV, turning it into a \"shopping catalogue.\"</p><p>Hope flickered anew for the web as \"conversation space\" in the early days of social networking, but companies devolved from \"delivering people to one another . [to] . delivering people to marketers.</p><p>\"The primary purpose of the internet had changed from supporting a knowledge economy to growing an attention economy.\"</p><p>\"We shape our technologies at the moment of conception,\" Rushkoff adds, \"but from that point forward they shape us.\"</p><p>\"Team Human\" traverses the New Age antecedents of Silicon Valley's \"transhumanist movement\" and the plot arcs of \"prestige television,\" among other subjects. Rushkoff is a supple thinker, unafraid of flights of lateral thinking - here's a fresh take on resurgent nationalism as an offshoot of the binary on-off dichotomy of computers: \"The yearning for boundaries emerges from a digital media environment that emphasizes distinction. ... This logic trickles up to the platforms and apps we use. Everything is a choice. ... There are no in-betweens.\"</p><p>But, Bernie to McNamee's Hillary, Rushkoff sees the taproot of our ills as a metastatic capitalism that views \"people ... at best [as] an asset to be exploited, and at worst a cost to be endured.\"</p><p>Thus, \"Team Human\" is a radical critique - Rushkoff has little truck with \"technosolutions that are radical in every way except in their refusal to challenge the underlying rule set of venture capitalism or the extreme wealth of those who are making the investments.\" Yet it's also conservative, extolling the age-old communitarian ethos behind the web. By reconnecting with this, Rushkoff writes, we can fortify ourselves against the depredations of big tech.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Zucked</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe </emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Penguin Press;

Recent works from activists, academics, polemicists and techies have contributed toward a flourishing genre. But a wealthy investor making a pile from Facebook, then finding religion sounds a bit, um, rich.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Zucked\" Photo: Penguin Press</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In \"Zucked,\" Roger McNamee winces at the memory of his introduction to Mark Zuckerberg. It was 2006 and he played the grizzled industry elder to Zuckerberg's tyro. Beware suitors bearing mucho cash, he intoned. Stay true to yourself. If he was expecting a high-five or \"hell, yeah!\" he had another think coming.</p><p> Like the interminable latency of an app struggling to load, five agonizing minutes elapsed, during which Zuckerberg struck sundry postures from Rodin's \"The Thinker\" before he responded, McNamee recounts. Awkward? It was excruciating. But it turned out they were on the same page \u2014 Zuckerberg wasn't for selling Facebook \u2014 and the encounter marked the beginning of a bounteous relationship: McNamee hooked Zuckerberg up with a friend named Sheryl Sandberg to help turn Facebook into a business; Zuckerberg cut McNamee into Facebook's early funding rounds. McNamee bowed out of his informal advisory role in 2009, but retained sufficient goodwill that when he emailed \"Zuck and Sheryl\" in 2016 with a hunch about Russian mischief, they replied promptly, if only to fob him off with a VP.</p><p> \"Zucked\" chronicles McNamee's move into open breach with Facebook: digging into its ransacking of user privacy, agitating for congressional action, huddling with George Soros to prep him for a speech at Davos calling for big tech to be brought to heel.</p><p> Thus, it can be read as an account of the adventures in activism \u2014 very 2019 \u2014 of a rich guy. But, written from the perspective of an ex-evangelist steeped in industry lore, \"Zucked\" lands crucial insights into how a firm that seemed a force for unalloyed good \u2014 connection with one another \u2014 became a scourge.</p><p> Roger McNamee Photo: Rick Smolan</p><p> From 2012 to 2017, Facebook went on a tear, McNamee writes. \"The company experimented constantly with algorithms, new data types, and small changes in design, measuring everything. Every action a user took gave Facebook a better understanding of that user \u2014 and of that user's friends \u2014 enabling the company to make tiny improvements in the 'user experience' \u2026 which is to say they got better at manipulating the attention of users. \u2026 Before long, Fakebook's surveillance capabilities rivaled those of an intelligence agency.\"</p><p> The prospects for reform from within are remote. The simplicity of Facebook's business \u2014 \"a product and \u2026 monetization scheme\" \u2014 have concentrated power in the hands of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. Both are concerned chiefly with avoiding splatter from scandals on their personal brands and heedless of criticism, writes McNamee.</p><p> This and the neologism he minted for the title of this book hardly augur well. How can we un-Zuck ourselves?</p><p> McNamee prescribes government-supported \"civically responsible social media\" and regulation, including the possibility of \"breaking up Facebook and Google.\" If this sounds drastic, it's all in how you frame it: \"In the realm of technology, what will we give up to protect democracy?\"</p><p> Our relationship with technology has \"inverted,\" he concludes \u2014 we've become its tools. Harking back to Steve Job's formulation of the computer as \"bicycle for the mind,\" we must restore \"human-driven technology.\"</p><p> \"Team Human\" Photo: Norton</p><p> The same preoccupation with reasserting human control over technology animates Douglas Rushkoff's \"Team Human,\" a trenchant take-back-the-web manifesto retailed in 100 mini-essays. Rushkoff's take: We've become enmeshed in the inhuman logic of a system arranged for the convenience of artificial intelligence and outsize profits for the few.</p><p> Exhibit A in his argument is currency, not crypto but the tokens exchanged among medieval merchants \u2014 a lubricant to trade that promised to spread the wealth before nobles co-opted the idea with a centralized currency and restricted access to commercial activity by royal decree.</p><p> This sounds far removed from Facebook, but the dynamic \u2014 the possibility for human agency and empowerment squelched by elite power grab \u2014 has played out in new media since, writes Rushkoff; for instance TV and radio, conceived for connection and education, but captured by advertisers and propagandists bent on \"instrumentalizing\" our attention to convert us to their agendas.</p><p> Then came the internet. Rushkoff was a cyberpunk, and he writes ecstatically of the early web: \"We were witnessing the first synaptic transmissions of a collective organism attempting to reach new levels of connectedness and wake itself up.\"</p><p> But the dot-commers crashed the scene. Where \"hippies and hackers\" saw \"Gaia,\" Wall Street carpetbaggers eyed online real estate to unlock shareholder value and remade the web in the image of TV, turning it into a \"shopping catalogue.\"</p><p> Douglas Rushkoff Photo: Rebecca Ashley</p><p> Hope flickered anew for the web as \"conversation space\" in the early days of social networking, but companies devolved from \"delivering people to one another \u2026 [to] \u2026 delivering people to marketers.\"</p><p> \"The primary purpose of the internet had changed from supporting a knowledge economy to growing an attention economy.</p><p> \"We shape our technologies at the moment of conception,\" Rushkoff adds, \"but from that point forward they shape us.\"</p><p> \"Team Human\" traverses the New Age antecedents of Silicon Valley's \"transhumanist movement\" and the plot arcs of \"prestige television,\" among other subjects. Rushkoff is a supple thinker, unafraid of flights of lateral thinking \u2014 here's a fresh take on resurgent nationalism as an offshoot of the binary on-off dichotomy of computers: \"The yearning for boundaries emerges from a digital media environment that emphasizes distinction. \u2026 This logic trickles up to the platforms and apps we use. Everything is a choice. \u2026 There are no in-betweens.\"</p><p> But, Bernie to McNamee's Hillary, Rushkoff sees the taproot of our ills as a metastatic capitalism that views \"people \u2026 at best [as] an asset to be exploited, and at worst a cost to be endured.\"</p><p> Thus, \"Team Human\" is a radical critique. Rushkoff has little truck with \"technosolutions that are radical in every way except in their refusal to challenge the underlying rule set of venture capitalism or the extreme wealth of those who are making the investments.\" Yet it's also conservative, extolling the age-old communitarian ethos behind the web. By reconnecting with this, Rushkoff writes, we can fortify ourselves against the depredations of big tech.</p><p> Zucked</p><p> Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe</p><p> (Penguin Press; 336 pages; $28)</p><p> By Roger McNamee</p><p> Team Human</p><p> By Douglas Rushkoff</p><p> (Norton; 243 pages; $23.95)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-5d181c8dd58f852de11312bb6c83a7d92973f3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCC-X8F1-JBCN-44XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

US 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren just wants tech companies to play by the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You don't get to be the umpire and have a team in the game,\" the Democrat senator told an audience last week, describing how she believes Amazon exploits its market position to smother competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the way she wants to achieve this could prove divisive. \"My administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition \u2013 including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google,\" she said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">campaign statement earlier this year</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren is far from the first to make this call. Over the past few years, the companies on her hit list have been accused of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030763-000-free-speech-has-met-social-media-with-revolutionary-results/\">perverting democracies</url>, amplifying hate crimes and stifling rivals.</p><p>\"How big do these companies have to be before they're considered too dominant?\" says Martin Moore at King's College London. \"When you have more than a quarter of the world's population on your platform, that qualifies in any book.\"</p><p>Still, most public figures taking on these juggernauts \u2013 chief among them Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition \u2013 have stopped short of a break-up. Instead, we have seen new rules, such as the EU's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831794-700-those-gdpr-emails-should-stop-soon-but-our-data-nightmare-wont/\">General Data Protection Regulation</url>, and large fines.</p><p>For example, Google has been hit with a string of whopping fines for abusing its market dominance in the EU, including \u20ac2.4 billion in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531330-400-googles-24bn-fine-is-small-change-the-eu-has-bigger-plan/\">2017</url>, \u20ac4.3 billion in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2174464-google-hit-with-e4-3-billion-fine-from-eu-for-abusing-market-dominance/\">2018</url> \u2013 the largest fine ever \u2013 and \u20ac1.5 billion in March. But set against the annual revenue of Google's parent company Alphabet (more than &amp;dollar;136 billion in 2018), they just look like a cost of doing business.</p><p>\"I don't want to call them parking tickets, but these are small fines for companies that make so much a year,\" says Cristina Caffarra, head of European competition practice at consulting firm Charles River Associates.</p><p>So if the fines aren't working, is Warren right to call for a break-up? It has been done before. In the 1990s, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15621113-400-focus-too-big-for-its-boots-consumer-fury-and-a-raft-of-court-cases-over-microsofts-trading-practiceshas-bill-gatess-baby-overreached-itself/\">US government charged Microsoft with gaining an unfair advantage</url>. By including its web browser, Internet Explorer, on computers running the market-leading Windows operating system, Microsoft was seen to be preventing other companies' browsers from getting a look in.</p><p>Microsoft was told it couldn't bundle separate software products together and was forced to open up Windows so that other software developers could write programs for it more easily.</p><p>But splitting off a piece of software like a browser is easier than carving up the likes of Amazon, Facebook or Google. Warren suggests separating the running of a platform from doing business on that platform. For example, Amazon runs the marketplace on which it sells its own cut-price products, making it harder for others to compete.</p><p>Benedict Evans, an analyst at venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz in San Francisco, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://mailchi.mp/ben-evans/benedicts-newsletter-no-450697?e=23e032de98\">described Warren's proposal as \"an odd combination of both very specific and very vague\"</url>.</p><p>Evans asks if this thinking applies to things like Apple's App Store. Should Apple be allowed to sell its own apps? What about supermarkets like Walmart and Sainsbury's, which have been selling their own-brand products at lower prices for decades \u2013 isn't Amazon just doing the same?</p><p>You could argue that Amazon's unprecedented dominance of online shopping makes things different. For Caffarra, it is as if Walmart or Sainsbury's had first bought most other retailers before cutting prices, which wouldn't be allowed in the bricks-and-mortar world.</p><p>Say you do want to break these firms up, then. The best way might be to undo mergers, some of which should probably never have been allowed, says Caffarra.</p><p>Google dominates online advertising largely because it bought up a string of businesses like DoubleClick. These are now integrated into Google's business and cutting them out would damage the whole, but it wouldn't be impossible, says Moore.</p><p>Facebook similarly grew to dominate social media by vacuuming up rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which helped it gain a foothold on most of the world's phones.</p><p>But again, it would be hard now to disentangle these apps from Facebook's core business, which is collecting as much data on people as possible. The company even seems to be trying to bolster its defences against a break-up: CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced it would be merging the code and data of Instagram and WhatsApp more tightly with the core Facebook app.</p><p>Even if you could see a way to do it, breaking up a large company is no quick fix. For regulators, it is a last-ditch option, more a threat than a viable response.</p><p>The European Commission, driven by Vestager, has been tougher than most on big tech. But, legally, to consider such a far-reaching course of action would require it to demonstrate that a break-up is the only way to reign in a company's bad conduct, which wouldn't be straightforward.</p><p>For these reasons, the better option may be to double down on regulation. Caffarra says that calls to break up big tech are more common in the US, where tech firms have been left to do more or less what they want since the Microsoft case 20 years ago. \"There is a sense of frustration in many quarters. Nothing is being done and nothing short of breaking them up will work,\" she says.</p><p>That may be starting to change. Last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/facebook-ftc-fine-first-quarter-financial\">Facebook warned investors</url> that it expected to be fined as much as &amp;dollar;5 billion by the US Federal Trade Commission, which is currently investigating the firm as a result of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2173905-facebook-faces-500000-fine-from-cambridge-analytica-scandal/\">Cambridge Analytica data scandal</url>.</p><p>Diane Coyle at the University of Cambridge, who co-authored an independent review of digital competition for the UK government, says regulators could use existing powers more. For example, in the UK, Facebook and YouTube could be treated as publishers and held responsible for their content. \"They'd have to do a lot to comply,\" says Coyle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u20ac8.2bn</emphasis> Total amount Google has been fined under EU competition law</p><p>The report also argues for new regulations, like making it easier for new businesses to use established platforms so that they aren't shut out of a market, allowing users to transfer data from one platform to another.</p><p>In fairness, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter are part of an initiative called the <url normalizedValue=\"https://datatransferproject.dev/\">Data Transfer Project</url>, which works towards this aim. But if we want services like search or social networks to become more like email \u2013 with different products, such as Gmail or Outlook, all using the same underlying protocols \u2013 then there is a long way to go.</p><p>Coyle also says regulators need to think differently about acquisitions. Treating Instagram as just a photo-sharing platform, and not a Facebook competitor, was naive, she says.</p><p>\"Regulation is inevitable,\" says Moore. \"But we have to be careful how we do it.\" He thinks we need a clear sense of the kind of relationship society should have with big tech before we jump in. Choosing the kind of services we want the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google to provide will determine how we shape the behaviour of the companies through regulation.</p><p>For example, if we think \u2013 as Warren does \u2013 that these tech companies should be more like utilities, then a search engine provider might become as highly regulated as water or electricity firms. Or if we care most about privacy and what happens to our data, then we need specific regulations to enforce transparency or interoperability.</p><p>Once we ask these questions, we may find ourselves <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731720-200-our-obsession-with-a-free-internet-led-to-facebook-data-row/\">re-examining the economic model behind these firms</url>. Some say the billions made by Facebook and Google are a result of \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132222-300-how-surveillance-capitalism-is-changing-human-nature-forever/\">surveillance capitalism</url>\", in which services are provided in exchange for personal data.</p><p>For Moore, dealing with this economic model is the bigger problem. \"If you don't, then you're going to get other companies just as dominant in future,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg24232282600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W19-2NP1-DY5K-Y0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 242</volume><issueNumber>No. 3228</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

On one hand, the audience for factual reporting and relevant news is larger than it's ever been, thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and fast internet access. But at the same time, the economics for newsrooms producing high-qualify digital journalism is worse than it's been since mass publishing exploded in the late 19th century.</p><p>It's a head-scratching conundrum for journalists. As revenue from print advertising continues to dry up across the board, you'd expect digital advertising to be on the rise, which it is ... just not for news organizations.</p><p>Overall digital advertising revenue has tripled since 2011 (the earliest year tracked), according to the Pew Research Center. It grew 23 percent alone in 2018, and now accounts for roughly half of all ad revenue in the U.S., according to eMarketer. Unfortunately, Google and Facebook suck in an estimated 73 percent of all digital advertising in the U.S., including a majority of online display advertising revenue.</p><p>Adding to the frustration is that about two-thirds of Americans continue to get a big chunk of their news on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube. In fact, the news content that flows through their platforms is so important to their users that both Facebook and Google have invested hundreds of millions of dollars (some would call it charity) to help prop up favored newsrooms hit hard by the shifting winds of ad dollars.</p><p>Not surprisingly, this shift in online ad dollars has been labeled a \"heist\" and a \"robbery\" in more journalism think pieces than I have time to mention here. As a result, news organizations across the country are banding together to finally take on the big tech companies ... with the help of some politicians in Washington.</p><p>But not only is the legislation far from a sure thing, there are many vocal critics of the approach itself, including from some prominent journalists.</p><p>Mr. Journalist Goes to Washington</p><p>Back in April, a top House Democrat teamed up with a Republican colleague to introduce the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which would provide a 4-year \"safe harbor\" for publishers to band together to collectively negotiate with the large tech platforms.</p><p>\"This is not just about their market dominance resulting in some impact on the sale of widgets, but this is really about the ability of citizens of this country to access trustworthy, reliable, local news, and a free and diverse press--particularly a local press--is really essential to the proper functioning of our democracy,\" Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and vocal critic of what he views as the monopolistic power held by large tech companies, told Washington Monthly in a recent interview.</p><p>Despite the interest in the legislation (and the debate it has spawned within the journalism industry), it's worth noting that Cicilline introduced similar legislation last year that went nowhere. And even if it passed the Democratically-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate, it would still need to be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticizes news outlets and journalists as the \"enemy of the people.\"</p><p>David Chavern, the president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, remains optimistic about the legislation's chances, and says it would give newsrooms greater negotiating ability with Google and Facebook, who have historically dictated terms to their own advantage. In theory, this newfound leverage would give media companies the ability to discuss everything from the licensing of content to better promoting the brands of legitimate news sources, which other than a small blue checkmark aren't differentiated at all from biased and fake news sources.</p><p>But Chavern also thinks the antitrust exemption would enable news outlets to band together to fight for something arguably more valuable than money--data.</p><p>\"You always hear the tech guys tell (media companies) we need to have a closer relationship with our readers ... But they tend to hoard all the data about our readers,\" Chavern told E&amp;P, who notes that both Facebook and Google track readers movements even when they click through to other websites. \"They know a lot more about your readers than you do.\"</p><p>The imbalance doesn't end there. According to Chavern, Google's dominance in all aspects of the digital advertising business extends onto news websites themselves, where the tech giant's ad-serving tools are often used to deliver ads (earning the search engine a nice chunk of every ad buy). Not only that, many newsrooms serve their videos using YouTube, which requires companies to use Google's products to purchase ads.</p><p>\"So the idea that, 'Oh, if only we drove traffic to our own websites the money would be untouched' is incorrect,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Then there's the algorithms deployed by Facebook and Google that news organizations live or die by, suffering from a lack of stability and an absence of any consultation before a tweak sends referral traffic through the basement.</p><p>Former Upworthy CEO Eli Pariser once said complaining about Facebook was like griping about the weather after an algorithm tweak intended to promote \"meaningful interactions\" from family and friends caused the one-time media darling's referral traffic to plummet. It also led to the shuttering of several digital media companies like Mic, and forced news organization who had pivoted to video at Facebook's request to pivot once again, this time with layoffs.</p><p>\"As a longtime news executive, I have been in the room too many times to count with Google, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and others as they have lectured us on exactly what we need to do to save our business. Virtually always, it's to bend our news practices--at our own expense--to their latest algorithm or experimental venture,\" Joanne Lipman, the former editor-in-chief of USA Today, wrote in an opinion piece supporting the safe harbor legislation. \"Today, journalists have no choice but to spend their days combating, worrying about or suffering the consequences of the financial Armageddon that has whipsawed our profession at the hands of our digital overlords.\"</p><p>Another Side</p><p>There aren't many journalists left who don't view Facebook and Google with a distrustful eye. But how to proceed forward and whether to take on the tech giants--who also provide a much-needed pipeline to readers--has become something of a debate within journalism circles.</p><p>Longtime media columnist Jack Shafer is among those who have been critical of the legislation. Shafer thinks the antitrust exemption being sought by news publishers is misguided for several reasons, but most notable for falsely blaming Facebook and Google for the decline of the newspaper industry.</p><p>\"They built a much better product. You don't have to spray your advertising message, you can target it,\" Shafer said, pointing out that it's not the job of Congress to steer back advertisers to print if they're spurning newspapers for a better product.</p><p>Shafer said journalists want a return to the glory days of 30 percent profit margins from the 1970s through the early 2000s, but forget about the less profitable days of the 1940s and 1950s, when competition from radio and the arrival of television forced the closure of hundreds of newspapers. He also says newspapers are partly to blame for their own fate, pointing out that media companies undermined their own revenue by investing in websites like Cars.com, Autotrader.com and CareerBuilder.com, which all drove advertising revenue away from their core products.</p><p>\"Everybody imagines this past in which Craigslist stole the classifieds from newspapers ... (but) all the big newspaper organizations went into the digital classified business themselves,\" Shafer said. \"In many ways, the newspaper industry saw the debundling coming. So it's a selective story the poor, poor, pitiful newspaper crowd likes to tell itself.\"</p><p>Shafer is far from alone. Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, said framing Google and Facebook's effect on the news industry in terms of dollar amounts is overly simplistic and \"not very helpful.\" Longtime media writer and innovator Jeff Jarvis blames news companies for their own woes, writing that publishers \"aren't competent at exploiting the full value\" of the readers sent their way by Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"While it's true that revenue for newspapers has declined sharply over the past two decades, and revenue for Google and Facebook has increased just as dramatically, it's not accurate to say that one increasing caused the other to drop,\" Columbia Journalism Review's Mathew Ingram wrote. \"The ad market changed in a number of ways--many having to do with an expansion of choice--and Google and Facebook took advantage of that.\"</p><p>What Tech Companies Say</p><p>Richard Gingras, the vice president of news at Google, said the tech giant has worked many years to support the news industry, whether through collaboration, offering supportive technology or becoming an advertising partner to help monetize content online.</p><p>\"Every month Google News and Google Search drive over 24 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" Gingras said in a statement to E&amp;P. \"We've joined forces with publishers on projects ranging from helping improve their mobile experiences to supporting subscriptions to deep advertising partnerships and last year launched the Google News Initiative, a major company wide effort to help a wide range of quality journalism thrive.\"</p><p>While Gingras didn't directly address it, there also has been a good deal of criticism of a claim made by the News Media Alliance--that subsequently made its way into the pages of the New York Times--that Google generates about $4.7 billion worth of revenue from news searches alone.</p><p>Slate's Jordan Weissmann concluded in a lengthy piece that the study--done by the economics consulting firm Keystone Strategy that relied on a 2008 estimate from a former Google executive that Google News brought in $100 million--was incredibly flimsy. Aron Pilhofer, a New York Times alum who is currently the James B. Steele Chair in Journalism Innovation at Temple University, called it \"nonsense.\" And Jarvis summed up his thoughts about the study and its back-of-the-envelope calculation with just one word: \"bulls--.\"</p><p>In addition, as Google has pointed out in the past, Google News itself has no advertising and earns no money. And both Google Search and Google News drive over 24 billion clicks to publishers' websites every month, according to the company.</p><p>Facebook declined to speak on the record to E&amp;P, but privately, several sources say it's sometimes overstated how important news is to the average Facebook user's experience, and that it's often overlooked that Facebook and Google drive millions of readers to news content free of charge.</p><p>How to Deal with Facebook and Google</p><p>Cicilline isn't the only politician attempting to rescue the news industry, whether it's from the tech giants or themselves.</p><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is once again running for the Democratic presidential nomination, revealed some loose plans to rescue journalism back in August. Not only does Sanders back the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, his plan would attempt to curtail major media consolidation--like GateHouse's purchase of Gannett--that tend to shed journalism jobs. He would also consider taxing the types of targeted ads Facebook and Google deploy and use that revenue \"to fund nonprofit civic-minded media.\"</p><p>\"More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda,\" Sanders wrote in an op-ed for Columbia Journalism Review.</p><p>Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., has his own bill to help news outlets deal with declining revenues, but does it without impacting the tech giants. Dubbed the Saving Local News Act, DeSaulnier's bill would make it easier for \"written news organizations\" to become nonprofits, something that has become increasingly difficult due to the specifics of the tax code.</p><p>Outside of Washington, News Corp is reportedly working on Knewz, a news-aggregation service powered by a combination of computer algorithms and human hands that would pull content from hundreds of national sources--including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and many others.</p><p>In essence, Knewz would connect readers directly to original news reports on the publishers' own websites without taking a cut of the advertising revenue. News Corp also plans to share reader data with those news organizations, according to the Wall Street Journal. But the company has made no official announcement about the product, it's potential launch date or whether it would highlight right- and left-leaning content.</p><p>In other countries, governments have gone after the tech giants themselves, The European Union has gone after Google several times on antitrust grounds, fining the tech giant more than $9 billion over the last three</p><p>years over various complains it abused its market share for financial gain. European antitrust regulators are also currently investigating Facebook's sales platform, how it uses and shares data from apps, and its Libra digital currency project, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>Shafer thinks the focus on digital advertising misses the point that news organizations have a great story to tell about circulation revenue, and the fact that the largest source of revenue for many newspapers now comes directly from their readers. Besides, according to Shafer, the days of advertising revenue sustaining large newsrooms appear to be long gone, even if the safe harbor legislation somehow passes through Congress.</p><p>\"It's lamentable, but I think it's kind of unstoppable,\" Shafer said.</p><p>Caption: David Chavern, News Media Alliance president and CEO</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-603152990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 603152990</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB5-3DC1-DYTM-91SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Duncan McIntosh Company, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Editor &amp;

His latest role is now as a President...</p><p>Brock Pierce, the former child actor best known for playing the young Gordon Bombay in Mighty Ducks and The Mighty Ducks 2, has since played the role of entrepreneur, philanthropist, and a billionaire blockchain mogul. His latest role is now as a Presidential candidate where he is running as an independent in the 2020 campaign race. Pierce announced the news of his candidacy on July 4th, followed by an appearance on Fox Business where he fielded questions from Maria Bartiromo and Steve Forbes, Chair and Editor-In-Chief of Forbes Magazine.   I had the opportunity to interview Pierce for Forbes Crypto. Besides learning more about his policy positions, I asked direct and detailed questions about allegations from his past, including charges that he drugged former employees at a company in 2000 and pressured them to have sex when they were boys, as well as how Interpol busted into a Spanish villa, when he was staying with his other two business partners, only to discover guns, machetes, and child pornography on the property. Finally, I asked about his involvement in a conference where he spoke about cryptocurrency that was arranged by Jeffrey Epstein in 2011. Pierce responded to all my questions, even the one where I asked how it felt when John Oliver roasted him on television over these allegations.    For Pierce, after the interview I held and less than a week into his bid, his campaign faces another challenge related to a decision by the NY Supreme Court on Thursday that allows for further investigation into a company Pierce co-founded called Tether. Additionally, Pierce started the campaign having missed the deadline in several states; however, even popular Ross Perot, who ran in 1992 as an independent, secured only 19% of the vote, so running as an independent in the U.S. is a major uphill challenge in America\u2019s two-party system. The full interview with Pierce is below.          Jason Brett: You mention Puerto Rico in your announcement as a candidate and spent a considerable amount of time there after Hurricane Maria. As President, how would you see your relationship and commitment to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico? Is it time for Puerto Rico to become a State?     Brock Pierce: The country is very polarized between us and them. We are forgetting that we are \u2018them\u2019 and we must find a way to collectively move forward. This is part of the journey of life when you are blessed with abundance. It\u2019s not the money I made, but the difference I can make.    I moved to Puerto Rico at an extraordinary time. Puerto Rico arguably was the first state, the forgotten state. As a private individual, I had to ask why things are the way they are [which resulted in] the island suffering the largest blackout in human history. Rather than use fossil fuels, renewable energy and solar energy could provide a resilient power grid at the lowest cost to the people of Puerto Rico.     As a businessman, innovator, and entrepreneur, I saw the island of Puerto Rico filled with U.S. franchises. I wanted to remind the Puerto Rican people that they can build their own businesses. Approximately 80-85% of the food is imported with no food security while the Dominican Republic is a 100% an exporter of food. I spent two and a half years in Puerto Rico, which in many ways has prepared me for being President of the United States just as much as time in a traditional public service role.          Brett: Do you believe Puerto Rico should become a U.S. State? How would you support the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as President?    Pierce: Ultimately, that would be up to the will of the Puerto Rican people. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory that is a forgotten part of the United States. I hope Puerto Rico and other territories that are forgotten will benefit from my potential role as President or [even just] running for the [President of the] United States.    Brett: What is your perspective on Covid-19 and the state of our country during the Pandemic?    Pierce: Overall, I am very concerned about our collective future. I am the father of two girls. I am deeply concerned. I run as an Independent candidate because it is not about left against right - we are all in this together. Covid-19 has made us more connected as a society.    Brett: You also mention how you also are a Minnesotan. What were your emotions when you saw the protests start in your state?     Pierce: Minnesota is the home state where I grew up. I still have family that lives there. Black Lives Matters is one of many injustices in the world. George Floyd is not an isolated incident. The BLM movement has connected people in a way and is a catalyst for how we need to reform our justice and prison system. How can we train our police officers to avoid an ongoing catastrophic loss of lives? These are questions I will look to answer as President.    Brett: In your video, you mention what it means to be, as well as a redefinition of what it is to be, an American. What is your definition of an American?     Pierce: I am a proud patriot. We are the leader of the free world, the light of the world, and the capital of innovation. America is a symbol of freedom. Some people are not proud to be American today. I want us to feel proud again of who we are, where we are from. I want to convene as a nation for all of us to look inside and define who we are, what are our values and principles, and what do we stand for, so that we can define our collective selves. Let\u2019s determine a new definition that would be something we can all be proud of as Americans.    Brett: Do you think the U.S. is behind on technology overall in the 4th Industrial Revolution?    Pierce: The U.S. is declining on a relative basis. The Industrial Revolution allowed some parts of the world to benefit greatly, including the United States. The 4th Industrial Revolution shows us the rest of the world is rising. China is rising. We need to think about the future of our quality of life and in a positive way with the concept of abundance. We must avoid the \u2018scarcity\u2019 mindset when it comes to the race to innovate in emerging technologies. Technology poses real issues around freedom and privacy that govern our nation. What we bring to bear as a people to the products and things we create. The United States still is the capital of innovation.         Brett: Former Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang mentioned a four-pronged approach to solve the problem of \u2018Big Tech\u2019 and our interconnectivity, particularly for children. Before sharing an approach to solve the problem of Big Tech, do you actually see Big Tech as a problem?     Pierce: We need to define what Big Tech is first. There are monopolies that exist in the world of technology. They have become \u2018monopolistic\u2019 types of organizations. Technology should be about choice and having options - now it feels like we have a limited number of options. We can\u2019t really see and touch it. Data is the new oil. I am an entrepreneur with real-world experience who understands technology. I understand Silicon Valley. I recognize how technology is affecting all of our lives. Technology is just a tool.    Brett: President Trump said Bitcoin was made out of thin air and his Treasury Secretary sounded the alarm on cryptocurrency with respect to money laundering and potential terrorist threats. Our country has established a money transmitter framework where cryptocurrency exchanges are treated as money transmitters on a state-by-state basis. What would your approach be to the regulation of cryptocurrencies? Do you sense that for many in Trump\u2019s generation and the baby boomers, that the concept itself is challenging to understand?    Pierce: We need to conquer the fear of the unknown. Bitcoin is not made out of thin air. When I hear that term, I think of a magician. Bitcoin is produced by computers, servers, and through energy consumption. The industry learned the hard way we live in a very regulated world. If you wish to innovate, you must play within the rules. As businesses, we must do what we can to educate our leaders so the rules can progress and we can stay competitive as a nation.I have spent time educating government officials, including those in a number of foreign countries, on how these technologies work. A number of foreign countries, most notably China, are using the technology as a way to export currency to challenge the U.S. dollar\u2019s world reserve status. This status is a pillar that makes us a great nation, the nation that it is. The threat only gets bigger. The lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. is causing us to lose some of our best and brightest talent. They are moving places that they consider safer to innovate in blockchain technology, such as in Europe and elsewhere. Talent flight is as dangerous as innovation flight. Instead of losing our best and brightest technologists, we should establish a regulatory sandbox that allows innovation and maybe gives startups a two-year grace period to operate as a start-up. The 4th Industrial Revolution that is taking place with our regulations stifling innovation [will take away our country having a] seat at the table.    Brett: In a podcast in 2014, you said you were excited about the possibility of digital FIAT currencies on a blockchain and how this could create global opportunities for the unbanked. As you look around now at the interest in what is an explosion in the growth of \u2018stablecoins\u2019 and the simultaneous research and investment in \u2018central bank digital currencies\u2019, and your role as a co-founder of Tether, which is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, what should the United States do about stablecoins? Do you support the U.S. in developing a Digital Dollar now?    Pierce: We do need a U.S. Digital Dollar. Tether is the most significant innovation in FIAT currency since FIAT itself. Never has money moved more freely in a peer-to-peer way. We want dollars in digital form as the rest of the world moves toward a digital economy. Allowing the currency in digital form will increase the demand. If China attempts to move with a digital renminbi, their currency could be exported around the world at an exponential pace. The U.S. needs to be participating in this innovation. Artificial intelligence is important and quantum computing is as well. We are falling behind on all fronts. We should be on the front lines of this technology around the globe as well as find ways of making use for these technologies at home.    Brett: Certainly China is a concern, but what about other countries, such as Iran and North Korea?    Pierce: I am rooting for the whole world. I am a humanist, rooting for humanity and the planet itself. Mother Earth, who gives us life, she needs to govern us now. I am rooting for every nation to peacefully coexist. We are all in this together. I am not sure how we could afford a major world conflict again. I am a fan of Iranian culture. I think the Iranian-Americans are a wonderful people. I believe in \u2018Peace in the Middle East,\u2019 that wounds can heal. I have spent a great deal of time on the Korean peninsula in South Korea. The North Koreans and the South Koreans are the same people. The DMZ [demilitarized zone after the Korean War] is the modern equivalent of the Berlin Wall. All that mattered was which side of the fence you were on. We need the \u2018DMZ wall\u2019 to fall and to allow families to reunite.    Brett: This country is largely based on Christian principles. You mentioned Mother Earth just now and also touched on your first introductory video by saying \u2018I\u2019m not perfect, God knows I\u2019ve made mistakes.\u2019 What are your religious beliefs?         Pierce: Well, I am a Christian. I grew up in a Christian household. My mother spent most of her time in church. She would take me to church as a child on Saturday morning, Saturday night, Sunday morning, Sunday night, and then sometimes on Monday and Tuesday as well. I am also a spiritual person. I am a student of theology and study different perspectives, where they come from and why they believe and what can create respect between two people with different beliefs.    I am a non-denominational Christian. The three largest locations in the world for Catholicism are Italy, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. I have spent time making regular trips to the Vatican and have gone to Catholic Church with my brothers and sisters. I identify in part with all of them. When I spend time with my Republican friends, they think I am Republican. When I do the same with Democratic friends, they think I am Democratic. When I spend time with Libertarians, they think I am a Libertarian. I am non-denominational and non-partisan.    Brett: To tackle the elephant in the room for our readers, the news of your Presidential campaign announcement creates a renewal of a \u2018scandal\u2019 in 2000 alleging you provided boys with drugs and pressured them for sex. There is also a mention of your 2002 run-in with Interpol where guns, machetes, and child pornography were found in the Spanish villa, and you and your fellow Digital Entertainment Partners were arrested. At the same time, through all of this, you say you have never been charged with a crime. You had to know that by choosing to run as President, these questions would arise and people have probably come to their own conclusions already after searching the Web. What\u2019s your side of this story?     Pierce: As a Presidential candidate, I knew I would be placed under a microscope. These questions are long overdue. I believe I will benefit greatly from people taking a deeper look at this. Further research will indicate people are more positive on my candidacy. What you mention refers to events years in the past, when I was 16, 17, and 18. I was a kid at the time. These allegations are untrue, proven to be untrue. Each of the plaintiffs have all apologized to me and dismissed their cases. More information on all of this can be found on my website. What do you want to know?     Brett: In one case, the records show a settlement amount of $21,000?    Pierce: The lawyer refused to dismiss the case after working on it for years. The lawyer of one of the plaintiffs demanded out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of $21,000 which we agree to pay. Since that time, I realize this created a misperception of the settlement. The defendant, Michael Egan, has made lies, and we now know the allegations he made again were untrue- when he did the same thing in 2014, his own lawyer offered a public apology.    Brett: When Marc Collins-Rector, your former business partner who is a convicted sex offender, went to England to get treatment for a brain tumor and then renounced his citizenship to the United States, what was your reaction to his denunciation of U.S. citizenship?     Pierce: Rector had served his time when he left for England. I have had many people who come to me in these troubling times. I tell people who want to denounce or renounce their U.S. citizenship, that let\u2019s not give up on America\u2019s future. America is what we make it.    Brett: Was John Oliver unfair in his portrayal of you as he focused on the negative aspect of cryptocurrencies?     Pierce: Oliver is a great comedian. It was not fun to be the butt of jokes by tens of millions of people. It was great entertainment, of course uncomfortable at the same time when you are the butt of the joke. The cryptocurrency industry itself was the butt of the joke for the whole episode. These things can be damaging; however, after I stepped away from Block.One, the company went on to raise $2.5 billion for a total of $4 billion.    Brett: Joichi Ito, head of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), resigned after it was revealed that he and others on the staff of the Media Lab, which created the Digital Currency Institute, had attempted to conceal financial contributions from a convicted sex offender. From the Royal Family to former Presidents to our top Universities, my own take is many, many individuals had connections with Jeffrey Epstein. It strikes me that in 2011, you were invited to a conference to talk about cryptocurrencies that Jeffrey Epstein was involved in. How many cryptocurrency conferences have you attended?     Pierce: I was invited to a conference to talk about the future of money. I have spoken at hundreds of cryptocurrency events around the world. It was a great honor. I had no idea who Jeffrey Epstein was.    Brett: In terms of economic crisis, there was a feeling of absolute fear during 2008-2009 when watching bank stocks were falling and large banks that were on the brink of failure. It turned out companies like AIG had carried too much systemic risk that a taxpayer bailout was required. What as President would you seek to do to help avoid or at least curtail the impact of financial crisis\u2019 in the future?    Pierce: Had we used the technology to monitor systemic risks, I believe we would have prevented the 2008-2009 crisis. The idea of RegTech and ways blockchain technology can be used will help all of our regulators monitor the economy in a way that will only make them better at what they do. I am also concerned about the amount of debt our nation has taken on. Not just college debt like student loans by individuals, which can be understandable sometimes due to a lack of financial expertise, but when corporations are taking debt out who are the experts at managing debt, this latest crisis is disconcerting.    Brett: Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg did not graduate from college. As a fellow successful business mogul and billionaire, neither did you. Should this matter in viewing your candidacy? Is this a good example to set for Americans? You do not have a history of holding public office in any capacity. Of course, our current President did not and our last President had very little experience. You are over 35 and have been in the U.S. the required number of years to qualify to to be President. What makes you qualified to be President?    Pierce: I never stopped learning when I left school. I learn every day. I have been educated through the process of living. I am like a sponge.    Brett: Thanks so much for your time.    A video of Pierce\u2019s campaign announcement , along with his official registration with the Federal Election Commission, puts him one step further along than Kanye West who announced his candidacy on Twitter and seems torn between the idea of running now or giving himself 30 days to make up his mind. West has been making public statements that make Pierce seem like a three-term U.S. Senator running for President by comparison.    Only time will tell if his campaign can survive past allegations, current investigations, and the challenges of running as an independent in a two-party system to have any kind of lasting impact. At least he shares one battle scar in common with our current President - Donald Trump too experienced an unexpected comedy roast in front of millions of people at the White House\u2019s Correspondents Dinner in 2</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42567303095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B5-HTP1-JCSC-J3D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

And I absolutely loved it. I really didn't enjoy diabetes, and so I turned to that page all the time. I really believed that that was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> That's Mary Anne Patton. She's from Brisbane, and she has type 1 diabetes. And she built her own artificial pancreas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm James Bullen, this is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN, and today the team here at ABC Science will be introducing you to people taking tech into their own hands. We'll hear about new platforms made by and for sex workers with Ariel Bogle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> And Carl Smith will be introducing us to the people who tinkered with the very first computers, and made them sing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joel Werner:</emphasis> But first, James, people build their own artificial pancreases?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> They do, and they call themselves Loopers. We are about to meet one of them, Mary Anne. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes almost 40 years ago. And back then in the 1980s, it was very tricky to manage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> Back then we had a test tube, we had to do a pee into it, and we used Clinitest tablets to give us some vague sense of what our blood sugars had done in the preceding hours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Type 1 diabetes means you don't produce insulin, or not enough. Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas, and it helps the body move glucose in the foods we eat from our blood to our cells where it's turned into energy. For people with type 1 diabetes, the level of sugar in their blood can get out of control.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> You're trying to manage your blood sugar level so that you don't dip into hypoglycaemia, which can cause you to have pretty much a panic attack. That could happen without warning really.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> It's sort of like walking a tightrope every day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> So you're trying to keep your levels above that, but only just above that. You don't want them to be high, if the levels are high then you get worried about long-term diabetes complications, and maybe you've experienced some of those. It's quite a mentally arduous task to keep your blood sugars in that really healthy range. And the long term, you feel like there's this Sword of Damocles hanging over your head with regards to your future and developing blindness or kidney failure or something like that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> The tech that Mary Anne was using back then left a lot to guesswork.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> Ao we actually had no way to detect hypoglycaemia, apart from whether we were shaking, sweating, feeling confused. It was really stabbing in the dark back then.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Sometimes literally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> We get used to it, we are real stoics, as diabetics, we just poke and prod and prick ourselves all the time, and don't think about it. But certainly as a young teenager the first time I had to use a blood-letting device, it was pretty awful. I called mine the 'blood grinder'. It was quite savage, there was no way to tune it to be a bit gentler, it really did get the blood out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> These gruesome tests helped Mary Anne see if her blood sugars were in the right spot. And the majority of people with type 1 diabetes manage in a similar way today; test strips and a glucometer to check blood sugars, and injections of insulin, sometimes three or four each day to keep them in the Goldilocks zone. There have been some innovations since then though. Some people have insulin pumps, which inject a steady supply of insulin day and night.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> The pump just gave me a little more freedom, it was still a pretty blunt tool, in retrospect, but it did help to get rid of some of the rigidity of the diabetes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Then there are continuous glucose monitors. As the name suggests, these provide a real-time readout of a person's blood sugar levels. They're also known as CGM. And it's these pieces of technology that opened the door to the holy grail Mary Anne had read about as a child in the hospital; the artificial pancreas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> It was really only at the end of 2017 that I discovered the #WeAreNotWaiting movement, and that some really, really clever people had reverse-engineered insulin pump protocols and set up these fabulous algorithms to manage diabetes in a really high-fidelity treatment kind of way. It's just totally changed, for me, the whole nature of diabetes itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> The movement Mary Anne mentioned just now started under the Twitter hashtag #WeAreNotWaiting. It has since spun out into social media groups, in-person meet-ups, and increasingly diabetes and med-tech conferences around the world. It brings together people who have built, or are building, a do-it-yourself pancreas.</p><p>One person who got involved in the movement early on is Jim Matheson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> It was always like in 15 year, you won't have to worry about this, the software will have sorted it out. And they were saying that for 30 years, and nothing had come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Jim was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 10 years old. After meeting with some of the founders and developers of early closed-loop systems, he decided to build one for himself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> I don't think my wife saw me for a while. I definitely wasn't coming to bed, I was working til midnight. She didn't understand, I just kept ordering stuff off of Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Frustrated by the wait for a commercial solution, Jim joined the growing group of people developing their own automated pancreases and taking control of their diabetes. But how exactly does a DIY pancreas work? I visited Jim at his home in Sydney so he could show me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> The first thing that happens is...I built and installed myself an app onto my iPhone, and that app talks to both the insulin pump and the CGM which I wear. I use a Dexcom CGM.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> The pump is attached to Jim's body, and the CGM is checking his blood sugars. But those devices are usually completely separate, they don't talk to each other, at least not unless you do a bit of tinkering.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> What happens is every five minutes the Dexcom app on the phone reads in my blood glucose levels. Those just come in, so we constantly know where I'm at. At the same time, using a conversion device called RileyLink, it can do the translation between iPhone talk and pump talk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> The RileyLink is a small circuit board cased in plastic, it's about the size of a matchbox.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> It will also query the pump and get constant information about any activity that's going on with your insulin. And then it can also send commands to make changes in your insulin levels. Inside the iPhone app I have settings that say if I'm going up at this rate, these are the right ratios to help bring me down.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> So Jim's CGM is measuring his blood sugars and talking to his iPhone which is then adjusting his insulin on the fly. By combining all of these things together, he has essentially built his very own bespoke pancreas, and he can see all of this pancreas data coming in on his smartphone in real time. It's pretty amazing to watch.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> I just couldn't stop watching it. It was really good, I started texting all my old diabetes pals, telling them about this great brain that was controlling my diabetes, finally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> In mid-2018, Mary Anne decided to build her own artificial pancreas too. Because these systems are often called closed-loop systems, people who have them sometimes call themselves Loopers. She read about how to do it online.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> It was a learning curve, and there were a couple of times where I had a hypo. But I had all the usual alarms that alerted me to that. The first few weeks were about trying to fine-tune my settings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> And she did start to see improvements in the way her diabetes was being managed, even in the first few weeks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> Automatically a fabulous change in HbA1c.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> HbA1c stands for glycated haemoglobin, and it's basically a measure of how much sugar carbohydrate is attached to the haemoglobin molecule. This is the molecule that carries oxygen around the body.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Dr Tien-Ming Hng is an endocrinologist who works with people who have type 1 diabetes. HbA1c sounds complicated, but it's really just an indicator of the amount of sugar in your blood over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> If your blood sugar levels are higher for the lifespan of that molecule, which is about three months, the measurement you're going to get is a higher number. In medical circles, a lot of the long-term trials of complications, outcomes, have been based on A1C over the past 30 years. So there's interest in knowing what the numbers are.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Mary Anne and Jim both saw their HbA1c head south after they started looping.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> It dropped from 8.5 or something to 6.8, and now is in the low sixes. That's taken me out of the risk of diabetes complications group into the probably never have to worry about complications group, which is brilliant. That's a very stark difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> My HbA1c was an 8.0 before I started. It's actually quite amazing how quickly those things can change. I think I was in the high fives within a couple of months. Essentially I'm at a steady state now of between 5.0 and 5.2, maybe 5.3, for my A1Cs pretty much consistently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> But HbA1c isn't always a reliable measure of good health. Someone whose blood sugars yo-yo-lots of highs, lots of lows-could still average out to what seems like a good number. What's also important is how long you spend 'in range', in other words in that Goldilocks zone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> What I found is now that I've been looping, the edge cases are so few and far between, I'm pretty much very consistent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> We now know that knowing what someone's time in range is another important parameter because it's perhaps more reflective of what's going on from a day-to-day basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Dr Tien-Ming Hng has conducted a survey of Australian loopers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> It was interesting to see that, in particular, having better quality sleep was a standout feature there. I can understand the significance of that report. If you use an insulin pump, and you have blood sugar levels that are not stable, you can get alarms going off in the middle of the night and so you have disturbed sleep, and not only you but your partner and your whole family, your household is woken up. So just by being able to sleep better makes a difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> This is early research, with a very small sample size; 19 respondents, reporting their own results. But all of them listed improvements in their blood sugar levels and their time in the Goldilocks zone. Dr Hng says they also wanted to take things into their own hands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> People were doing this because they wanted to take control of their diabetes on their own terms, using their own technology. And so these were people who were quite motivated, were also to some extent happy to explore and to take a risk to manage their diabetes using this method.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Were you ever concerned about tweaking devices in ways that the manufacturer perhaps hadn't intended?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> Not really. I know some people are. It's sort of depends I think with the pump. The reason why we can communicate with the pump is the early versions of the Medtronic pump were intended to have that communication. So really the only part that was a little bit hacky was how we received that communication. But that's real information going back and forth between the pump and the looping system. We weren't tweaking at all with any of the readings from the CGM, so that was really on-label in terms of how the manufacturer had produced that. So I wasn't really too worried about the technology. It's certainly the first question I always get asked though.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> The pumps and monitors Loopers use are typically approved by the TGA in Australia. But they haven't been explicitly approved for the purposes of a closed-loop system, and neither have the pieces of open-source software used to run the system. This doesn't concern Mary Anne though.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> There are lots of safety settings there, there's safety settings dialled into my pump. So there's really only so far the algorithm can influence things. I feel it's good to reassure people that this system has been set up extremely thoughtfully to ensure safety.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> In the US, the Food and Drug Administration has fast-tracked the approval of commercial closed-loop systems. But last month it also released a warning about DIY systems after a report of a patient needing medical assistance. The person's CGM sent incorrect values to their looping system, giving them doses of insulin that were too high and causing their blood sugars to crash.</p><p>Diabetes Australia, the country's peak diabetes advocacy body, doesn't endorse DIY systems. It says people who choose to go DIY do so at their own risk. But it also says people can't be stopped from pursuing their own solutions, especially when commercial options have lagged behind. That's the position Dr Tien-Ming Hng takes too.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> Personally my belief is that people will do what they want to do, and as a physician one has to decide whether you're going to support them. I do think it's important to support these people, because diabetes is not only about the blood sugar levels, there's a lot more to it than that. And so if you don't support these people, where are they going to go to? One needs to draw a line somewhere about what can one advise in terms of people using systems they've built themselves. It's very clear that they build systems knowing that it is at their own risk. I think a lot of people go in with their eyes open. I think a lot of people get benefit from it, and it's just at the moment I don't think it's something we can openly recommend, which is a different level altogether of care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> At last count, about a hundred people in Australia report using closed-loop systems. It's a tiny fraction of the total type 1 diabetes population.</p><p>But interest in DIY is growing, and commercial closed-loop systems are coming down the line too. The first of these, the Medtronic 670G, became available in Australia earlier this year.</p><p>Dr Hng says we need a clearer picture of the health outcomes loopers get.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tien-Ming Hng:</emphasis> There needs to be more research in this area. In professional circles, research goes a long way. The problem is finding money to do research. I think the DIY population would be keen to participate, given the opportunity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Mary Anne Patton agrees more research is needed, but also a different funding model. Looping is expensive, it's restricted to those who can buy the required parts, have the technical ability to set it up, and then there's the ongoing costs of continuous glucose monitoring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Anne Patton:</emphasis> It's extremely expensive in Australia for...I think 88% of people with type 1 diabetes are adults and they aren't eligible for rebates or subsidy, either through the National Diabetes Supply Scheme or through private health insurance. I know three people at the moment who want to loop. I spoke to a friend yesterday who really wants to start, she's had diabetes since the 1970s. But she just said, 'Look Mary Anne, I just cannot afford the CGM. I just can't do it.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> But for those who can, looping provides a new sense of control over a condition that stays with them for life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Matheson:</emphasis> People that don't have diabetes, when they're trying to figure out what we're doing here, what they don't realise is diabetes is this thing that's always there. It's never going to go away. You could be on the toilet, you could be in an important meeting, you could be chasing your daughter around, all of the things and stresses you have in your life, diabetes is always there. And you're always having to make adjustments for that in everything that you do, and it's all guesswork. People think maybe what you're doing is dangerous. Diabetes is dangerous! It really is. You have to learn and adapt, and make lots and lots of guesses, literally hundreds of them every day.</p><p>So what I think is great about this automated pancreas system is I can program in the things that I know for me, including how much I'm going to drop if I'm exercising or how to adjust it if I know I'm going into a big stressful meeting or something like that at work. It knows all of those things and over time with the press of a button it can make those changes for me. The reality is I'm not always there, for every single decision a hundred times a day, I'm not there. I might have to wait 20 minutes to do something that would be optimal to do now. So it's actually much safer, it's not much more dangerous than just having diabetes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> That was Jim Matheson, a looper. And today on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> we are hearing about the ways people are taking tech into their own hands. In that story it was about the regulator lagging behind, but, Ariel Bogle, sometimes the regulator over-regulates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Exactly, and it's not just legislative inaction that can make a mess of people's lives, sometimes legislated action, passing laws, can start denying people access to the tools they need. One group this is happening to is sex workers here in Australia. Laws passed in the United States are having a very local impact.</p><p>What would the internet be without sex? Just a curious bit of technology that barely made it out of the lab perhaps. I'm exaggerating of course, but with the explosion of online porn, online dating, the opportunity to take on whatever fetish identity you like, it can feel like cloud storage was basically invented for this stuff. It seems curious then that much of the Western internet that we in Australia interacts with has become more and more unfriendly to sex work.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> Sex workers are often at the front-line of a historic turn into towards censorship or towards any sort of xenophobic ideology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Gala Vanting is the president of the Scarlet Alliance, Australia's National Sex Workers Association. She's talking about a package of laws that was passed in the United States last year.</p><p>The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act are mostly known by its acronym FOSTA-SESTA, and their purpose was to help curb sex trafficking online. They did this by making website publishers responsible if third parties are found to be posting ads for sex work, whether consensual or not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> The stated intention of the bill is to combat the online proliferation of sex trafficking. But effectively what it does is it wipes out the ability for sex workers to use the internet to do things like advertise, network with one another, use safety tools that exist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Sex trafficking is an appalling crime and a serious issue for lawmakers right around the world. But according to Gala Vanting, when those American laws were passed it had a major impact right here in Australia on the legal sex work industry. She says FOSTA-SESTA has forced a whole range of American internet companies to kick sex workers off their platforms, even here in Australia where some forms of sex work are legal state by state.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> The way that SESTA-FOSTA influences Australian sex workers is that a lot of the platforms that we use are based in the US and a lot of big tech is based in the US; things like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. So there's also the sense that those companies do not want us on their platforms, regardless of where we reside.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> When the law passed, the Internet Association, which includes the likes of Google, Facebook and Microsoft among its members, said it was committed to ending trafficking online, while warning against laws that make them liable for the actions of their users.</p><p>One website in particular was a key target for US lawmakers for its alleged complicity in sex trafficking. It was called Backpage. Backpage was a classifieds website well known for its sex worker advertisements. It had cracked down on these adult ads in 2017, but it was nevertheless shut down by the FBI in April 2018. Several people involved, including the website's founders, were charged with facilitating sex work and money laundering, among other charges. But despite it being an American-made platform, the effects of Backpage's closure in Australia were very noticeable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> That impacted Australian sex workers because it was a global platform and it was something that was very accessible, it was affordable for low income sex workers to use.</p><p>But look, anything like this, it will always hit the most marginalised workers first and hardest. And in Australia that is that is trans workers, that is workers of colour, it's genderqueer and non-binary. And so I think the very people who we say we are attempting to make life better for are the ones who go down first.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estelle Lucas:</emphasis> My name is Estelle Lucas and I'm a private escort situated in Melbourne. Every time I speak to another sex worker they're talking about how slow it is, how competitive it is. They don't understand why they're not getting work when it's because they're trying to cut off the work from the internet. So they're struggling in their day to day, they're getting more desperate, and when people get more desperate they start making not great choices or they don't really have much choice anymore so they have to start doing other things.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Supporters of the FOSTA-SESTA laws say they're a vital step in the fight against the global sex trafficking industry, but sex worker advocates argue that taking down sites like Backpage makes sex work less safe, and make illegal situations more difficult to spot. Even the US Department of Justice, for example, suggested the laws could push bad actors offline and make them harder to prosecute.</p><p>Gala again:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> The loss of Backpage was a safety issue for sex workers in Australia and globally because it cut off access to clientele. So perhaps you have to change the form of work that you do or you have to change your offerings or something like that in order to in order to get the clients that you used to get.</p><p>And so when your income drops, obviously you have to think about how you're going to how you're going to get that back. And for some people that was offering services that they didn't necessarily want to offer or advertising in places where they didn't want to or choosing other forms of sex work like camming or street-based sex work. And so I guess the safety issue is kind of about self-determination.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> It's not just about finding work in ways that are safe. From the beginning, the internet allowed all kinds of communities to find friendly spaces to gather online, often in ways they couldn't in the physical world.</p><p>After the FOSTA-SESTA laws were passed, waking up to find those spaces closed down or closed off because of the laws and politics of a foreign country has become a possibility for certain vulnerable groups. Those in the industry say the loss of sex worker friendly spaces online restricts their ability to screen clients online and share safety information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estelle Lucas:</emphasis> I can't go into too much detail of how sex workers manage their safety within their own spaces, this is information that's only for sex workers. But I can tell you very confidently that those spaces have been jeopardised because of these laws. People are scared. People cannot report things anymore to their peers, and it has just created a whole new exercise to try getting into another safe space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> At first, the internet significantly expanded the services available to sex workers, but their withdrawal has kicked off some necessary adaptation to the new status quo. Some are turning to online tools that specialise in keeping communications secret and secure, Protonmail for instance, which is also used by journalists, claims to operate under Swiss privacy law.</p><p>Estelle says workers have had to learn more about encryption, a cryptographic technique that obscures information as it's sent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estelle Lucas:</emphasis> Sex workers had to move on to Protonmail for example instead of Gmail. A lot of sex workers didn't know how to do that, didn't know how to transfer. I had like 10 years' worth of emails just transfer over, well nine years at that point. But that is a Swedish company that protects your information and encrypts it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> But tools created by outsiders can never be as aware of and tailored to the needs of the sex worker community as those built by their own. That's one reason why Estelle began her own technology business based here in Australia after FOSTA-SESTA became law.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estelle Lucas:</emphasis> I started a web hosting company myself called Red Cloud Hosting in response, because a lot of people's websites were being taken down, hosting got taken down. So all these all these access points that we need to be able to even function on the internet have just been taken away from us and we can't say anything. So we are left with little means to be able to make a living.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Gala from the Scarlett Alliance says that sex workers have always adapted to new tools, and post-FOSTA-SESTA it's no different. There are new sex worker run classified sites to replace Backpage, sites like Red Files that connect sex workers with each other and services, and there is Switter, a social platform built in Melbourne by and for people in the adult industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> I think that there has always been a very strong resilience within the adult industry in general to wrangle technology. And often we are...the adult industry is the first to implement a new technology. With FOSTA-SESTA it really discourages the development of digital tools to be used for sex worker safety or to be used for advertising because it's kind of precluding that, so if you want to roll that application out in the States, which is probably what's going to make it financially viable, you can't do that.</p><p>So I think that in theory there's certainly a lot of scope, there's a lot of possibility in that space. But if I think it's quite hard to actually do it, especially without a fair bit of capital and what VC is going to invest in a sex or in an adult app.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Estelle is also dealing with the teething pains of starting a technology project from scratch. When she tells people the price of her servers, for instance, they sometimes balk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estelle Lucas:</emphasis> So some people like sex workers won't understand why that was so expensive. And I'm, like, it's because I don't have a warehouse with a thousand servers that I can just loan out. I can loan out one server from someone else's property that is full of warehouses and servers and that's all I can do. So it's a very grassroots project, I'm not like a tech developer or something, it's just making use of my webmaster's knowledge and being a little bit crafty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> It's hard to run a tech start-up at the best of times. Gala says that in many cases, the normal route for a technology business is not available for sex worker-led projects, like finding angel investment or venture capital funding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> There's also a lot of whorephobia in the tech industry and there's a lot of distancing between those workers and my industry. And so that's been really difficult to see as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> These biases can make interacting with other tech workers difficult.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> The biggest problem from that I've encountered with whorephobia in tech is that tech workers believe that they can solve sex worker problems without including sex workers. And if I hear one more developer tell me that they're making the Uber of sex work...who knows. Like we're not ready to let go of our screening practices and hand that over to someone who says that they have the technology to do it better. We know how to do it and we've been doing it forever and the internet really allowed us a lot more information in order to do it, and I think we're not really ready to hand that over.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Sex is often at the forefront of technological change; porn online...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> Even sex robots, everyone's favourite.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> So given that, I ask Gala whether the technology industry is trying to ignore the intertwined history it has with sex and sex work.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> Sex and the sex industry has made amazing contributions to technology over the years. I think people are just kind of done with us as soon as it's no longer favourable to have us on their platform.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Perhaps the treatment of sex workers online is part of a familiar pattern; as the internet's open spaces become dominated by a few key companies and countries, it becomes less open to those on the margins, but then of course they adapt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gala Vanting:</emphasis> I think that the sex industry does feel a bit abandoned by tech, but at the same time it's still working to infiltrate that space and to co-opt those tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> That was Gala Vanting, president of the Scarlet Alliance.</p><p>You're listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN. And, Carl Smith, we've heard some pretty serious stories today, but sometimes people take tech into their own hands for fun, for a bit of joy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Yes, and prepare your ears for some very ugly, grainy computer blurts. I've dug up the story of how Australians created the world's first digital computer music, and they did it just because they could.</p><p>[Computer music]</p><p>What is that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> That's probably the first music ever played by a computer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Probably?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, to the best documented evidence available in the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> 70 years ago, Australia's first digital computer started running its first program. It launched Australia into the digital age in 1949, just after the US and UK. But this computer did something no other digital computer had done before; it played music.</p><p>Dr Paul Doornbusch is a music historian who studies computer-generated music and he's the Associate Dean of the Australian College of the Arts. He accidentally stumbled upon the story of that jaunty little tune we heard while reading a newspaper in Europe in the '90s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> I was working at the Royal Conservatory of Holland, and like a good expat Melburnian I would regularly read the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Age</emphasis> online. And I read an obituary of Trevor Pearcey and how he built this computer CSIRAC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> In that obituary he read that Trevor Pearcey was an extraordinary and visionary computer scientist.</p><p>Barbara Ainsworth is a curator at the Monash Museum of Computing History, and she wrote a biography about Pearcey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Ainsworth:</emphasis> Trevor Pearcey was a physicist, a mathematician, and a computer scientist and an academic. He did so many different things. He started working in physics and microwave propagation. And when he came to Australia to work for the CSIRO he was very interested in mechanical computing. And he knew they needed a machine to increase their efficiency, and he designed one from nothing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> That machine was called CSIRAC, which stands for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer, Australia's first computer. And depending on how people categorise early computers, which is surprisingly contentious, it's either the 3rd, 4th or maybe the 5th digital computer in the world.</p><p>Dr Peter Thorne is the former head of computer science at the University of Melbourne.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> Before that, only a handful or only two or three computers had worked anywhere in the world. So this was a pioneering effort here in Australia and quite a remarkable achievement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Peter Thorne was the author of the obituary that Paul Doornbusch read in Holland. He'd worked on CSIRAC and with Trevor Pearcey. So he wrote things like this about Pearcey's work:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> Trevor was 26, and by the end of 1949 they had at least the start of this computer in the sense that it could now execute and store programs. So we date the starting point from then.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> But he'd also included something like this in the obituary:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> The computer was exhibited publicly in 1951, and by then it was playing computer music.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> That was what really struck Paul Doornbusch while he was reading Pearcey's obituary in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Age</emphasis> in Holland.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> And there was one line in there that said it played music in 1951 or 1950 or '49 or something. And I was at one of the world's most prestigious computer music departments at the Royal Conservatory of Holland, the Sonology Institute. I thought, no, it's a typo, because I knew that computer music started in 1957 at Bell Labs. They were interested in telephony, so through a little bit of sleight of hand they established a computer music department because it might have relationship to what we do with telephones.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> For a long time that was considered the first computer music. Max Mathews at Bell Labs in the USA worked with composer Newman Guttman to create it and it was played for the first time in 1957. So Paul Doornbusch decided to follow up with Peter Thorne.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Almost as a second thought I thought I'll send off an email, and so I just sent off an email and said, yeah, I just read this obituary and there was just a small error in it, computer music started in '57 at Bell Labs. And I got a reply from Peter Thorne saying, no, no, it happened in the early '50s in Australia, people remember it, people were there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> Those who'd worked with CSIRAC always knew that it had played music. We hadn't realised the significance of that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> And I remember going and speaking to my colleagues in Holland and saying, people reckoned this happened. And they're going, wow man, that's pretty weird. If that happened, that is amazing, that is completely amazing. And so that started the whole thing, me then writing another email, you know, 'Are you sure?'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> Paul contacted me and said this is really important, we have to recreate this music. And I sent something back saying, 'Paul, this is a mad idea. The computer, although it's intact, doesn't work. We are not going to make it work.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, maybe it is possible, why don't we work on it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> We have paper tapes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Yes, in this era of computing, machines were fed reams of paper with holes punched into them, that was their data and they were known as paper tapes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> And this was what the programs were stored on. So there was a set of pigeonholes with these programs all on this paper tape, and you chose the programs you wanted, maybe spliced some of them together. If you wanted to change a program, you might be able to just punch another hole in the tape or you might be able to fill in a hole with a piece of sticky tape.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> CSIRAC's old paper tapes were still lying around.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> We have those in modern translated form. We scanned them, as it were.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, eventually we had a project in I think 2000, 2001, to resurrect, reconstruct the music played by CSIRAC, because it was never recorded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> And Paul was right and I was wrong, and an amazing project was commenced which involved Paul and senior engineers who were still alive at that time and still working, and they managed to do a faithful reproduction of the music.</p><p>[Computer music]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> That is CSIRAC playing 'Colonel Bogey's March' which was a popular song of the wartime era.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> To recreate this music and how it would have sounded coming out of CSIRAC was an enormous feat for Paul Doornbusch and his team. It began by trying to understand how the machine originally operated. Thankfully CSIRAC was and still is intact. And Dr Peter Thorne had been a service engineer operating the machine, so he knew how it worked. We went to take a closer look at CSIRAC at Melbourne's Scienceworks Museum where it's currently on display.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> I worked with this computer, CSIRAC, way, way back in the late 1950s, and it is the only first-generation computer intact anywhere on the planet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> It is quite an impressive and large computer, much larger than the computers we are used to seeing. Can you describe to me each of these different components we are seeing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> Yes, well actually there are no transistors in this computer. It has vacuum tubes, valves that glow, rather like a light globes, and it has 2,000 of them, each of which glows away when the computer is working, and the components are all separately wired and separately soldered. And so the computer weighs about 2 tonnes, and it used about 35 kilowatts of electrical energy, which is about enough to power a street of houses. Of course the capacity of a computer is far less than a modern computer. It's a million times slower than the computers in your phone or in your laptop, and it's got a very, very small amount of storage, about 2,000 or 3,000 bytes compared with the gigabytes that you store in a modern computer or indeed in a modern smart phone. It was used...</p><p>[Computer music]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Well, we just got rudely interrupted by the machine there. What sort of work was this computer doing for university and research scientists?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> It was used to generate some of the world's first numerical weather forecasts, designing the state electricity power grid, some banking calculations. It was used by nuclear physicists for their calculations. Although it only worked at about 1,000 operations a second, the only choice one had before this was a desk calculator that worked at about one operation per second. So on this computer in an hour you could do equivalent calculation that would take you three months on a desk calculator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Ainsworth:</emphasis> The first computers were calculators that were electromechanical. So they would move and shift things, they were analogue, they simply moved digits around but they didn't store them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Barbara Ainsworth.</p><p>CSIRAC and the first generation of digital computers could run any kind of operation rather than just running fixed programs with fixed parts. That's because digital computers used digital code which made them more flexible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Ainsworth:</emphasis> What we needed to achieve was a machine that could take on different problems without wiring to make them work that way or perhaps a set of cards to direct them. So the achievement is to perceive that problem and solve it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Despite their flexibility, digital computers hadn't been designed to play music. It's not yet known why the researchers behind CSIRAC decided to program it to play songs but Paul Doornbusch says its unusual design meant it had the capability to do so from when it first started spitting out data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> A couple of things about early computers. There was no display, no screen. The input was a punched paper tape, and the output would also be a punched paper tape. So the computer had a speaker on it to be used as a diagnostic aid because you wouldn't really know if a program had finished. So they would put a stream of pulses just going to the speaker at the end of a program, they called it a blurt. It would go [pthh] and the program had finished, and you'd go, hurray, the program has finished. And they would often run the program is a couple of times to check that they got the same results. And sometimes if they were trying to debug a program, they would put some different blurts throughout the piece.</p><p>Geoff Hill was an Australian programmer, Australia's first programmer, who wrote this program for CSIRAC to play that tune. He must have gone, oh, I've just made this thing make a sound, if I can get to those pulses to go at a regular period, I'll get a steady pitch. If I can then control that, I can get a note, and multiple notes to create some music. And so I think that was probably the progression of events. There is no evidence one way or the other, but that's a logical sort of thing to think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> But by talking to those working on CSIRAC or their relatives and digging through the old paper tapes, Paul Doornbusch was then able to figure out what happened next. Although Trevor Pearcey had designed the machine itself, it was programmer Geoff Hill who made it sing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> He had coaxed it into playing scales. And Geoff Hill was an incredibly interesting character. He was a savant mathematician, but also he came from a very musical family, and many members of his family had perfect pitch. His mother I think was a piano teacher, one of his sisters was another music teacher. And I heard stories about him calling up his mother at nine o'clock at night saying, 'Mum, can you have a listen to this?' And him holding the telephone receiver down to the computer and playing notes and him asking her, 'Are all of the notes in tune?' Because he was trying to get the tuning right. And her saying, 'Geoff, don't be stupid, why are you playing silly games with a paper and comb at this time of night? Come home, your dinner's in the oven.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> What was the first song that we are aware of that he made, and what's the story behind why he decided to do that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, the first song on the music tape is 'Colonel Bogey's March', which we've heard. His widow, who I interviewed, suggested there might have been an earlier song, something like 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' with fairly sequential and stepwise motion to the melody that he could have programmed before that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> The dates around when these songs were programmed and played in the lab are still a bit fuzzy, somewhere between 1949 and 1951. But then in '51 CSIRAC played its first song to a public audience. I guess you can kind of think of this as an early electronic music party, just a different sort of crowd. And Geoff Hill was the headline and only act for that first set using CSIRAC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> November 1951, at Australia's first computing conference full of computing specialists, from locally and from around the world. And people's jaws fell apparently when CSIRAC played some music for them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Why? Why would that have been so shocking at the time, hearing one of these early computers suddenly singing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, I don't think people expected it. There was very little in the way of tangible output from these machines. They generated a lot of noise in their operation, the clattering of the readers and the punched paper tape machines, the air-conditioning would have been quite loud. Any disks that they had it would have been driven by a washing machine motors. So they were loud, noisy machines with no visual display, and to have it play music was a kind of tangible output.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> You went on quite a journey of forensically piecing together what happened back in the '50s. Can you tell me about the journey you went on through this project?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> I remember excepting the Australia Council grant to do it, without knowing how to do it. So I felt under pressure, and I had an office at the University of Melbourne to do this, and I remember standing in my office with a whiteboard and pacing backwards and forwards and going, hmm, how are we going to do this?</p><p>And so we built some hardware to reconstruct the pulse shapes, valve hardware, thermionic valves, electron tubes as the Americans call them, and they behave very differently to modern-day circuitry. And we'd found the punched paper tapes, we read the paper tapes, some of them by hand, two of us doing it and then comparing results, where we didn't agree going back on checking, typing it all into a file. And we built an emulator and we added to that some software to drop a file out of the timing of the pulses. Once we had the timing of the pulses and the shape of the pulses, it was a matter of just combining them, and there's your digital audio file. But to get one step closer to authenticity, it had to be played back through the speaker. So the museum very kindly gave me access to the machine. The original speaker was damaged, so I found one from the same month of production, bolted it onto the door, filled the cavity with the same sort of volume that was in there, and played this digital audio file through the speaker and recorded it with a microphone to get as close as possible to what would have happened recording it in the day.</p><p>[Computer music]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> How did you do that? How did you recreate the background noises there as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, it's called physical modelling technique and it's used for things like simulating guitar amplifiers today and simulating musical instruments, and so it's the same sort of technique. I learned all of those sorts of things in Holland, and so I just applied it to the concept of, okay, what are all the moving parts, what's their rotation speed, what's their likely frequencies coming out of them, the air con, et cetera,, the volume of the room that it's in, what sort of reverberation doesn't have. It's an approximation but I have played it to people who were there and they say it's actually pretty good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> There's been ongoing contention around whether these weird grainy blurts are indeed the first computer-generated songs. A lot of it comes down to definitions of what makes a computer and what makes a computer digital or electronic.</p><p>But by 2004 the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Computer Music Journal</emphasis> published a story about Paul Doornbusch's research and the body of evidence he'd accumulated. In 2005 Dornbusch also released a book.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> This became noted internationally and ultimately it was acknowledged that Australia was the first place in which computer music was played.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Who knows, something might become available at some later time, something might be unearthed because there have been some odd claims made. But for the best evidence available from any research to date, that's the first thing played by a computer ever.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Ainsworth:</emphasis> It was a physical demonstration of how a computer worked to a community in Australia that was thousands of miles away from what had been achieved in Europe and in America. When they had a public exhibition of it, it demonstrated to Australia what could be built here, what was achieved with Australian engineering, and also what could a computer do. People did not really understand how a computer could be used.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Barbara Ainsworth.</p><p>Shortly after CSIRAC started singing, the CSIRO decided to can the project and move away from Australian-designed computers. Many were disappointed. The computer itself was packed up in Sydney and driven down the highway to live a second life as the University of Melbourne's first computer.</p><p>Peter Thorne says that while that decision might have led to Australia missing the first digital wave, CSIRAC still had a lasting legacy in many different parts of society.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> What did come from this was a realisation of the capability of these machines in terms of the public, but also the development of generations of people who could use these machines.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> For Paul Doornbusch, CSIRAC's music is a bittersweet milestone. He says while Australia pioneered computer music, the country didn't capitalise on it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> I would still say Max Mathews from Bell Labs is the father of computer music because he was the one with the vision to say, well, this could go somewhere, let's keep pushing it, get composers involved. It's a bit sad that nobody was able to take what happened with CSIRAC and develop it, and that takes some foresight, to look at something with no practical application that you can see at the time and think this might go somewhere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> Where did it go?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> Well, it went to the digitisation of sound, sound being available on computers, on the internet, recording sounds digitally, which is what we are doing right now, to enable the lossless editing of them. It opened up a whole new world, a completely different universe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> And eventually a completely different universe of music, for better or worse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Thorne:</emphasis> We knew that we were at the start of something amazing, but we could not foresee how far it would go. We couldn't foresee that one could carry around in one's pocket something that could play music, take digital photographs, play computer games, communicate and all the amazing things that have happened in the years since.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> And for Paul Doornbusch, whenever he hears those weird little early computer blurts, he hears something innately human.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Doornbusch:</emphasis> It just shows that humans will try and make music with everything, and I think that is the best reflection. Whatever tools we have, we will try and make music with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carl Smith:</emphasis> And I think whatever technology we have will also be adapted to our lives and the things that we want to do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ariel Bogle:</emphasis> Absolutely. I mean, whether it's using computers to make music, sex workers building their own online platforms, or people designing a bespoke pancreas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bullen:</emphasis> Today's stories were produced by Ariel Bogle, Carl Smith, Joel Werner and me, James Bullen.

Mussio host a free conference on Big Tech and Antitrust on Oct. 2 at the Rotman School of Management Anyone who surfs or scrolls through the sea of bad news on Twitter or other social-media platforms might be tempted to believe that Winston Smith, the tortured protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, might see in our own moment strong parallels to George Orwell's archetypal dystopia. All he'd have to do is get an iPhone and unlimited data to prove it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in our world, it's not Big Brother or an all-pervasive state that's the only problem: It's the institutional tech behemoths of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (Alphabet), known as the FAANGs.</p><h>Texte/Text</h><p>Our technological moment offers other upgrades. Instead of imagining Nineteen Eighty-Four's future as \"a boot stamping on a human face - forever,\" as O'Brien, a character in the Orwell novel, describes it, it might be - as Julian Assange argued in 2013 - \"Washington-backed Google Glasses strapped onto vacant human faces - forever.\"</p><p>In spite of how Nineteen Eighty-Four ends, with the triumph of power, novelist John Crowley noted Orwell himself knew that \"people, real living people ... would simply not give into the Nineteen Eighty-Four model, not for long.\" People, and history, have ways of rewriting our darkly imagined dystopias.</p><p>In our world, Big Tech is powerfully challenging that assumption. A handful of gigantic U.S.</p><p>corporate entities exert a remarkable degree of influence over stock markets, commerce and the flow of information. The pandemic has only added to their market and cultural power.</p><p>Some act with near-sovereign authority in promoting their own agendas and silencing others. As Harvard scholar Shoshana Zuboff has argued in her remarkable book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the power of tech companies moves well beyond concerns over the control of commodities, print media or even software, to strike at the very heart of human behaviour and democracy itself.</p><p>The question of monopoly control, of trust and antitrust, is at the centre of the North Atlantic world's public policy debate.</p><p>In the United States, the Justice Department is preparing a spectrum of antitrust suits against Big Tech. Congress's excoriation of the Four Horsemen of the Tech Apocalypse (Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg) makes for riveting and oddly satisfying theatre. The European Union casts a regulatory net to blunt the FAANGs.</p><p>By contrast, Canada is left to work out its own salvation as an outsider to these regulatory blocs.</p><p>None of these questions are new; the particulars may be different, but the debates are remarkably similar. How much power and control do we allow corporations or governments to exert? What is the role of government in all this? How does public policy balance the awesome power of technology to generate wealth without producing winner-take-all outcomes?</p><p>Debates over corporate control of the economy are as old as capitalism itself. Here, insights from our collective past are important in understanding how the domination of Big Tech is both similar and different to the past.</p><p>In late-19th century U.S., monopolies and trusts dominated the economic landscape, especially in commodities and utilities: Andrew Carnegie controlled steel and John Rockefeller controlled oil. In Canada, Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook) built steel and cement trusts. In both countries, regulation - including outright government ownership - resulted.</p><p>After 1945, monopoly concerns shifted to giant manufacturing and traditional media companies. Until the 1970s, U.S.</p><p>administrations looked askance over General Motors' control of over half of the car market.</p><p>Starting in the 1970s, technology companies sparked questions of whether firms were too big or powerful. IBM's mainframe computing domination gave way to Microsoft/Intel's personal-computing duopoly.</p><p>Few people remember Bill Gates bailing out a failing Apple in 1997 with US$150-million, largely to avoid Justice Department scrutiny of his company's domination of the operating-system market.</p><p>These examples appear almost quaint to contemporary eyes, especially when confronted with the idea that the product isn't a Chrysler - it's your personal data and human behaviour.</p><p>But each of these cases has its own set of insights on what we got right and what we got wrong in the past. So, what do they tell us?</p><p>First, recognizing and publicizing the problem is essential in challenging these giant firms.</p><p>Muckraker Ida Tarbell's 1904 expos\u00e9 of Rockefeller's unfair practices galvanized the issue in the U.S. That element seems well under way.</p><p>Second, as Kevin Lynch and Laurence B. Mussio noted in Policy Magazine in 2019, \"designing regulatory policies that target unacceptable market and societal outcomes but do not hamper innovation and entrepreneurship\" should be the No. 1 job of public policy. Principles-based regulation and collective codes of conduct, supported by legislation, may strike the right balance. Public policy needs to act, and act strategically. In the 1970s automotive sector, government policies encouraged offshore car manufacturers to enter the U.S.</p><p>and Canadian markets, effectively breaking the Big Three oligopoly. It's a good example of the possibilities in expanding choice for consumers while managing economic imperatives.</p><p>Third, Canada should, as it has in the past, shape its approach to Big Tech through its own aspirations and experience, one necessarily different from the U.S. or EU.

The New York Times is doing what might generously be called a symposium on internet privacy. Their tech maven, Farhad Manjoo, says it's time to panic over internet privacy[1]. He's about a decade late on that, not that it matters. </p><p>Sarah Jeong points to extant A.I. uses[2] being sold to us for our own good, when they're really ways for corporations to monitor their risk and revenue. Comedy writer Samantha Irby has a healthier view[3]. I don't know how thrilled I am to be giving up my secrets, but it's foolish to think I have any control over them, and ultimately I don't care. I love convenience and entertainment too much to worry about how much information I cannot control is being leaked to marketers, retailers, the government and whatever Chinese intelligence agency controls the barrage of ads for $13 dresses thatsaturatemy feed. It's not that anybody wants to give away their privacy, but it's so convenient and fun. You can either worry about it, and be upset while your every secret is uploaded to the technology gods, or you can just shrug and enjoy. Either way, it's going to happen and you're going to use Facebook anyway. Ross Douthat takes the Luddite position[4], while naturally denying that's what he's doing. This is the hard truth suggested by our online experience so far: That a movement to restore privacy must be, at some level, a movement against the internet. Not a pure Luddism, but a movement for limits, for internet-free spaces, for zones of enforced pre-virtual reality (childhood and education above all), for social conventions that discourage career-destroying tweets and crotch shots by encouraging us to put awayour iPhones. But we know all this. We've known this for a long time, even if the efficacy is dubious. Data is often right, providing information about you that you had no idea they knew. At the same time, it includes information that's laughably inaccurate. Government has been selling our data, as have corporations, for years. Technologies like facial recognition work great, but only, say, 80% of the time. The rest of the time, they miss by a mile, and still that's close enough for our expectations of mediocrity. Just wait until autonomous cars really arrive, and you realize what that 1% failure rate means in terms of real lives. When the issue was whether government use of tech had Fourth Amendment implications, the Katz expectation of privacy test was, well, tested. And it failed miserably. The Third Party Doctrine meant we not only had no privacy from our computer overlords, but that the government could have at it at will. We should know, even if we don't or never bother to think about it, that every iota of our lives is available in data format. But to whom? Kara Swisher comes to the conclusion that one would expect of her[5]. So here's an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules \u2014 rules that have real teeth \u2014 on big tech companies. So cool that she used 'grok' as she calls for 'rules \u2014 rules that have real teeth \u2014.' Of course, China's rules are authoritarian, so they're out, and EU's rules are too heavy handed as well to serve as a model. Europe's message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else. Then there are states, like California, whose adorable legislatures think they get to rule the internet, as if a patchwork of regulations makes sense. There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo. But the one thing she does know, if not how to accomplish anything she calls for, is that something must be done, and that something is regulation. Let me be clear \u2014 I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously. Do they act 'monstrously,' whatever that means? No doubt there are stories of terrible outcomes, but they act like businesses have always acted, using what they have, what we give them, to milk us of money. And as much as internet ads never seem to match anyone's interest, mostly because they're trailing indicators of what we've already bought rather than what we want to buy, we still use Amazon to undercut the corner store until the brick and mortar stores are gone and Amazon can jack up prices as high as each of us is individually capable of paying. But is the answer the government? Does Swisher grasp that she would rather place her faith in the Federal Trade Commission than Zuck? I would argue that we needboth, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company's top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don't. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don't. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you. Of course we don't like these things, to the extent 'like' has anything to do with it. It's not as if we dislike it enough to go the Douthat route and throw our clogs at servers. So let's take our privacy and hand its management over to the government, because that's surely the way to protect us from Bezos, by giving it to Trump? We may hate the invasiveness of the technology (and I refuse to get a fridge that will tell some e-grocer when I'm out of milk because I have the ability to figure it out for myself). But as bad as it is that big tech is 'stealing' our privacy, handing the keys to our privacy to the government will cost us far more than having to see some lame internet ads. @Jack may well be an internet thief, but at least he spends less than the FBI on our credit card. And let's get real, it's not as if we didn't leave our credit card lying around for the taking anyway. *It's sexist. It's old. Don't blame me.

Here\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">the sign-up</url>.) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. President Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were \u201cdead as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">The remarks</url> may not be his last word, given his campaign promises to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The death of an American soldier in a car bombing last week was the reason Mr. Trump cited for abruptly ending the talks, but <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">some Afghans were skeptical that one U.S. fatality</url> could have upended the process when the deaths of thousands of Afghans had not.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">Our reconstruction</url> shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s cancellation of his plan to bring the Taliban to Camp David was more nuanced \u2014 and as off the cuff as the idea itself.</p><p>Taliban violence continued unabated on Monday, with more civilian deaths, while the end of negotiations appeared to open the way for a presidential election in Afghanistan on Sept. 28.</p><p>2. It\u2019s official: No no-deal Brexit \u2014 for now.</p><p>A measure requiring Britain to seek another extension from the European Union if there is no withdrawal agreement by Oct. 19 became law, dealing Prime Minister Boris Johnson a crushing blow. </p><p>Parliament (and protests) are going deep into the British night. The lawmakers are preparing to vote on whether to hold a snap general election, with Mr. Johnson likely to be rebuffed again. Then they adjourn until Oct. 14. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">Our live updates are here</url>.</p><p>In addition, John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons who has made enemies in the Conservative Party, said <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">he would step down by Oct. 31.</url></p><p>3. Juul misled smokers about safety, the F.D.A. said.</p><p>The dominant e-cigarette company <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">violated federal regulations</url> by selling its vaping products as a safe alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes without approval, the agency said.</p><p>The warning came amid a public health crisis. More than 400 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses have been reported, and the ailments may be tied to five deaths.</p><p>Public health investigators have yet to determine a specific cause, but have cited the use of vaping products from a number of companies as possible suspects.</p><p>4. The tempest over the hurricane forecast keeps growing.</p><p>The secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, threatened <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">to fire top employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</url> last week after its Birmingham office contradicted President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, according to our sources.</p><p>That threat led to NOAA\u2019s unusual disavowal of the Birmingham office\u2019s statement.</p><p>On Monday, NOAA\u2019s acting chief scientist sent an email to staff members that he was looking into \u201cpotential violations\u201d in the agency\u2019s decision to back Mr. Trump. He called the disavowal \u201ca danger to public health and safety.\u201d</p><p>5. Bernie Sanders has a long history with \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d</p><p>The Vermont senator has <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">staked his presidential campaign on transforming American health care</url>. His mother\u2019s illness and a trip he made to study the Canadian system help explain why.  Above, Mr. Sanders in 1988. </p><p>His dogmatic approach to health care has helped set the agenda among Democrats, and the issue will most likely be prominent once again as the candidates debate. The third debate is on Thursday in Houston.</p><p>We also look at how <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">Senator Elizabeth Warren wooed wealthy donors</url> for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her presidential bid.</p><p>6. Another British mess: the airline strike.</p><p>Pilots striking on Monday for more pay from British Airways will be off the job again on Tuesday, resulting in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">some 1,700 flight cancellations</url> and 195,000 passengers being rescheduled or getting refunds. Above, Heathrow\u2019s nearly deserted Terminal 5. </p><p>They plan another strike for Sept. 27.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">Here\u2019s what travelers need to know.</url></p><p>British Airlines said it had contacted customers two weeks ago to offer a choice of full refunds or alternative flights, even on different airlines. It was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">not exactly a seamless process</url>.</p><p>7. Help wanted. A lot of help.</p><p>Amazon says it has <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">30,000 jobs open in the U.S.</url>, the most it\u2019s ever had. The openings reflect a company growing in many directions and a national unemployment rate near a 50-year low.</p><p>The posts don\u2019t even include hourly, seasonal positions like warehouse workers. In fact, more than half the jobs are tech-oriented. The company is holding hiring fairs next week in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville, Seattle and Arlington, Va.</p><p>At the same time, Amazon is a target of government scrutiny over whether it improperly favors its own products and services. We have <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">a breakdown of the various Big Tech investigations</url>. A new one today, from state attorneys general, focuses on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">the market power of Facebook and Google</url>.</p><p>8. It\u2019s a big week for new books.</p><p>The actor George Takei gives a detailed, wrenching account of what happened to thousands of Japanese-Americans \u2014 including himself, at age 5 \u2014 in the wake of Pearl Harbor in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">his new graphic memoir, \u201cThey Called Us Enemy.\u201d</url></p><p>Other highly anticipated books out this week include <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">\u201cThe Institute,\u201d Stephen King\u2019s latest</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">\u201cGender and Our Brains\u201d by Gina Rippon</url> on the myths of the male and female minds.</p><p>See <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">our latest reviews here</url>.</p><p>9. Some of the N.F.L.\u2019s preseason expectations are already history.</p><p>Baltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson, above, was assumed to be a runner, but he emerged as a productive passer. And the Cleveland Browns, forecast as a contender, proved hapless.</p><p>But Kansas City is still a bona fide Super Bowl candidate, and so are the Los Angeles Rams. See the rest of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">our N.F.L. reporter\u2019s assessment of Week One</url>.</p><p>The Browns weren\u2019t the only ones to leave crucial points on the table.

I'm against the motion of all and against the motion and question for and I have a question for the people who are for the motion. people who are for the motion Could you give a concrete example good did like giving concrete example of of one or two companies and how you'd split them up. Would you split them by sector or vertically or by country? All right. How can you split up the companies? That's the question, Number four, please. we'll come to you soon. I'm against the motion and I think the proponents the big tech companies gave the game away on this when Rana started criticising for bringing disasters like Brexit, like Trump, like worst of all populist parties in Europe because what we're seeing here is the death rattle of the old progressive monopoly. This was a way of thinking and now people are being which dominated society for many years empowered by technology to disagree. All the criticism of these big tech companies is coming from the left, the progressives of politics who are fed up with their monopoly being taken away. Thank you. Here at the front, please. On microphone number one. Hi, I'm for the motion and I was just wondering, you were talking about the dreams and the fact that Facebook is made to unleash all those dreams but you're giving the impression that Facebook is a philanthropist's organisation. I ask you how does Facebook make money? What is its business model and surely that gives it away as well? Okay, thanks. Elizabeth, I'll come to you soon, but that first question about how do you split the companies? Each company would have to be looked at in a different way - but let me say... - Can it be done?

their market dominance state attorneys general about on bail an investigation likely to focus on Google to try to crack down on anti-competitive practices we will be live in new York to find out what this means for the companies and their users also coming up in the programme pilots from the UK's flagship carrier British Airways are on strike 17 100 flights cancelled tens of thousands of passengers affected was a lot the latest from the global markets a mixed picture across Europe right now and also caps making cash and doggies making $ will have an inside look at the lucrative world of tech influences new stars social media so acute that sought to come on this edition of talking movies Hello and a very warm welcome wherever in the world you're watching us attorneys general Argos unveiled details of investigations across several states into whether major US tech firms have been behaving in an anti-competitive way the probe which is being led by Texas is expected to focus on alphabet of course the owner of Google it dominates the world of online advertising last year brought in revenues of more than 136 billion $ this comes as tech firms are under increasing regulatory

America evening Asia Hello world welcome to the programme Let's get cracking because the US government is about right now grilling the big tech on foreign operators use of social media for of course political influence Let's take a look at some of the some of the details because the hearing is underway Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and the boss of Twitter<person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>the they're both of them will face questions from the Senate into intelligence committee NAC Facebook is expected to highlight how it has disabled millions of fake accounts effect a whopping 1.3 billion in the 6 months to March of this year Meanwhile Twitter is expected to argue against screening political content but says it's made changes to the platform that have led to a

Tuesday everybody it's time It's time for the money News that matters I'm Aaron Heslehurst and this if talking business Let's take a look at the top story a global clash between the right to be forgotten and free speech yet as the tech titan <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>challenges EU moves to extend the worldwide the rights of European citizens asked firms to remove out of date online personal information like to Washington to hear from this expert who says it could be a problem in the US because Americans would more easily viewed this as a limitation on free speech compared to their European friends I was coming up on the programme so unique it admits to using 100% renewable electricity by 2040 it just made a corporate giant to go green with some governments

big tech chance as well and there is a real concern because this is an antitrust tearing their dominance in other sectors as well not just the crypto-currency that's the focus today that all industrious Yes the antitrust hearings there was a big one yesterday the first step I guess you could say in the US starting to formulate something a of a different rate Jury system for them and 8 the country's was there as AmazonGoogleApple and Facebook sharing soldier wearing your competition how do we know we're not using your not abusing your position matter said the company's defend themselves pretty strongly have firms like Amazon for example sang their open marketplace is that more than 60% of things sold on Amazon sold by third parties but then of course a response that house committee was saying how do we know we've got your nominee appeal later in your a position as that marketplace to further your own interest to sell your products ahead of those competitors on your stores so this good way to run but having finally these hearings have been criticised in the past were not really going anywhere just being sound bites television I finally starting to see the the starting point of what might be regulation here in the future OK Thank you very much Daily in Washington with me now is Tommy 7 whose that from that minute capital Tommy we heard that what Dave Lee had to say they're set in France has a real push to tax said the tech giants led by France it said the time for talking is over Dave was alluding to that as well in Washington was starting to see some action but is going it alone the right course of action France's taking I entirely understand why France has done what they've done they've waited for a long time for the rest of the European Union and indeed the rest of the OECD to come together and have a fair rate of tax across the country's people dragging their feet essentially because they're scared of we've Khushal from the US and France said enough is enough these companies have to pay their fair share of tax in France the UK looks like it will follow suit fundamentally this is an absolutely fair thing to do you've got the big tech companies running billions of dollars in European markets and should pay their fair share of tax I say that as a tech entrepreneur and investor myself I think all license taxi owners would say the same thing thing is that there isn't really yet a global consensus that is what France is trying to get the G Finance Minister today but others say look we should really wait for a global consensus on the OECD and plans are afoot there's a lot of talking going on are expecting some kind of agreement shortly and you might get pockets of countries agreed to come together on this I think the US on the one hand because obviously these tech companies are us predominantly they were like it and you get a country like Ireland in the EU who rely on attracting big tech companies have very low rates of tax their economies need to think very unlikely Unfortunately to get a corporation that countries need and tech companies need to make this tax really efficient we say what tech companies need do you think that they really need attacks like this do because of course it will be interesting to see if there is some pockets of the group just how the opposition will come from the tech giant's I think tax of 2% or 3% of revenues is a cheap price for big tax paid to regain public trust they have been hammered on everything from sexism to the ethics they are right the invasion of privacy even Libre the cryptocurrency of Facebook's launch she mentioned there are so many issues with their under-fire they need to do such a better job a defined contribution to society and the most basic part of that is paying your fair share of tax initially embraced OK Thank you very much so that Tommy's Saddam from first-minute capital and also Dave Lee in Washington explaining what the issues at stake car for the tech giant's Let's move onto some other News now and red hair has formed a joint venture with China's ailing majors to build electric cars the Chinese market is one of the fastest growing in the world with more than a million vehicles sold last year men take a 50% stake in the venture the EU's top competition regulator is launching an investigation into Amazon's their suspicions the online giant misused merchant data on its website Amazon could face a fine of up to 10% of global sales it said it would co-operate with the authorities and Christine Lagarde has announced she will be stepping At managing director of the International Monetary Fund It comes after she was nominated to be the next leader of the European central Bank should leave her role at the IMF in September G7 finance ministers are likely to discuss a replacement at that meeting today but we've already be talking about it is time now to look at how the markets are doing now resurgent trade tensions some concern about the outlook for corporate America and the growing risk</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

market pop-up and see how the if not some of the London was a nice slightly down there and mixed picture of corporate down corporate earnings AstraZeneca the drugs maker though it certainly has been leading the way with 6% jump that was off the back of our will raising its yearly products sales forecast European markets also now down as well investors awaiting a much anticipated possible rate cut in September I can tell you a Tokyo can't they get taken certainly close up there that was on the back of the rallies that they saw us text doctors and healthy earnings and chat Japanese chip related companies and Brent crude is up 63 $ and 87 a barrel Let's get rid of that market talk now that Facebook because I'm sure you remember this late yesterday the company was slapped with a record 5 billion $ fine it is under investigation for potential violations of the US competition law and faces new data privacy rules yet its shares are up 56th birthday this year alone and the number of people using its That includes Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger at least once a month hit a new record of 2.4 one billion and billion people unbelievable Ben Collins senior research analyst at beacon policy advisers he joins us from Washington Bureau pay Ben good to see you my friend death that users and advertisers and not faze whatsoever about these fines about one hour investigation after another all the controversy surrounding this company that good afternoon was clear with the FTC settlement and I trust that the cost of doing business has increased for Facebook but in terms of a
