commented on for the next 12 weeks what do you think of them I think it's a very good report for the government if it is accepted a lot of recommendations made by the my Commission inquiry into this information fake news and looking at the wider responsibilities of of the big fish media companies and I think not many people can now see that with increasing concern about different forms of harmful content within the company that serves the content that users should take more responsibility for it they should be prepared to act against it take down to block accounts but Melissa is spreading harmful content and information of it is is very Bracken a black and white when talking about areas today illegal but we spoke to represent the big tech companies earlier and they were saying you when it comes into areas like disinformation for example It's a big grey that they need a very a very clear framework perhaps clearer than is laid out at the moment in order that they know what they can do what they can't Yes I think there does need to be very clear guidance on things like the information and there what we're talking about is material that is not just people have different opinions people spreading information that is that is clearly not true but it is not true and that can become even more important with the arrival of but they could defect technology which is if you can make fake films of people giving speeches of the given or doing things that are done and we will need the ability to identify and remove content and the focus of this shouldn't be on a member the public this happens to share something Pinsent and doesn't realise that it's not true but it's the orchestrated campaigns using vast network of accounts to deliberately spread disinformation we see evidence of this during our enquiries pop select committee inquiry the tech companies identify this sort of activity they should be called to account but these sort of judgment calls a normal in other industries and if this programme is the result but the regulator Ofcom and pepper as a Ukip cotton factory no woman think we have free speech robust opinions of the shots where their voices the Ross some basic standards have a team that if not met and there's an independent regulator to intervene Yeah I suppose one difficulty for what you're saying there is the UK broadcasting industrious is a lot smaller than the Hall into a but the principal thing very similar in the parliament identify what it thinks the standard should be an independent body have the legal power to enforce those standards and take action against organisations but on meeting agreed principles similar is just the execution it is you're looking at something witches is not quite infinite but he isn't far officer it's a very different thing to trying keep a handle on Isner they've got the technical capability to do it in the they built their businesses on understanding everything about the EU's so they can target happened to them so they can use it to sell a fake news that technology help appetite for self of to us welcome you support for free to challenge Marie Harf confident accounts spread that they have got the capability of has not been required to invest what we need to invest to do this properly not a commercial centre and do it we are good enough and expend to do it all about the criticism this impacts on free speech for example of the Adam Smith Institute said the government should be ashamed of themselves for on they say leading the Western world in internet censorship you know that the whole issue of free speech is a very delicate one It's a very important one a wider agree with that at all this is not about censoring free speech this is about saying people are deliberately spreading militia and maliciously spreading information to life but belive with the intention of trying to influence a democracy with interview about democracy or interfere with public health by spreading anti-vaccine information may lead to some not getting backing for their child and they should do that this is a serious issue is not about censorship Is not about saying the US for people to have freedom of speech of course the freedom of speech but in any sphere of our public life and appeared in your place of work in in your child's school in public somewhere where you are you can't say anything you like and support all the time illnesses for example there's a Texas popped period it says Ware where are the internet companies stand for example on posting something like a speech the President Trump has made which often there's a lot of debate about the truth or otherwise in in elements he quite that that sort of issue that the regulator will be getting into the tournament Emily talking about misinformation and the degree of that sometimes want but you can't do it people are entitled to opinions and it is if you're 50 speech he said it we know who the years and if he got it wrong for his facts wrong there's jeopardy him the people criticising for it what we see with these sorts of harmful disinformation campaigns is often made up stories being spread by organisations we

of you know that there is a global efforts to start regulating end coming down on these companies we read about the Sun seen many times you guided their regulators in the UK where you are there's the FTC and the DOJ over here in the United States and there's a bunch of other countries there are really starting to come down and his camp companies now most of them are focused on Facebook but Twitter is not that far behind and I think that if they can are very different perspective great and if it works even better quite Yes you're right there is a lover of just getting some good publicity material chanting how much do investors care like good publicity deal how much they care about bringing in some money from advertising and a business turning down I think it's part of a bigger trend of investors were concerned about the company's being socially responsible for doing good in the world if you think about Twitter's just taken a huge chunk of risk out of its business because they are not politicians anger go after it and say you that Russian trolls Venus to sway the election so I think the shares they react to that much terms the price for men but I think it is very much in line with the times and how people are looking at companies little bit differently that they didn't move that tells us something I guess an injured just finally before we go and can I ask you a question Apple as well shot with the iPhone sales it something you will talk about a lot on CNET I bought a result profits hit by weakening iPhone sales will go on Yeah it's really interesting I am also been dealing with this issue of they are this enormous company right there were more than a trillion dollars and the Ivan has gotten so large it is quite it hasn't grown in fact a stranger shrink and they've been doing with this issue a lot of different ways when the answer is offering new iPhones with better capabilities and tragic event has spent 1000.1 but while the other is to change their business really pushing people toward buying stuff like Apple TV plus an app or Arcade in all these services they offer and iCloud back-ups an hour of that NAC that stirring well they say that there that their watches really selling well that their air pilots and all about what it's like where you are you are instances where you see on every Street corner we don't really know great sense of giddy just yourselves out the market value and with the change in on another revenue stream yet target tau any love them global fund sales growth has ended that the industry is actually shrinking in terms of growth and and a generally speaking it everyone was buying it was gonna get far as one now it's just about up the Getting so fat all about what's next and the iPhone is a very profitable device the rest of their stuff isn't as possible so they are growing in their revenue but shrinking profits and eventually they will try and forgive me this and a lot of time trying to see how great it is right now but there are some concerns about how they will manage this shifting tired and will seek Ian Thank you very much interest there are two big tech companies TwitterApple make big changes that will affect allies one way or another in share their whose editor at large of the tech website CNET now known as Tuesday night I think it was there was rumours circulating about the French owner of Persia emerging with the USItalian car giant FiatChrysler and someone whispered in my ear this room has been doing the rounds for so long I can't be true you don't take any notice of it and of course it's happened now Let's talk to shanty Kellerman from Brown Shipley enchanting is a case of to car companies getting together and thrusting out for the future or to car companies proper each other up in difficult times I think it's the latter said the union but the issue I think these companies have is their bus sub-scale so does help to be and now be the 4th largest the world gives them a bit more scale but neither was particularly far ahead in technology for electric vehicles next generation power trains and neither had a huge presence in China and that's turning into the biggest car market in the world so I think it makes sense you know and then shares in both companies when up in response but I think this is the first of many it will seem more mergers in a coup in cars just because the costs develop vehicles are staggering and you need that scale to be able to invest we they've certainly got the scale now in the combined price tag of both companies best part of 40 billion \u00a3 and but Yeah it's not just a case of invested money to get the product right this is a whole new ball game for car companies going down this route</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

us Hunt Achica chief investment officer climate Hambro is going through the many page presentation from HSBC couple of things to come out this Global's Slowdown hitting their business they stated they can no longer achieve a previous profit Gol would make that I think the key challenge for HSBC globally is is Europe if you look at the results that you see in Asia they continue to grow It's actually quite profitable business but in Europe they have an unprofitable business and quite frankly the main challenge they have is the low interest rate environment which is observed by all European banks and their suffering as a result say not alone announced earlier this month cutting up to 10000 jobs globally and yet if you look at the numbers you look at the presentation actually there could be more Yeah they haven't really move the dial on the cost if you look at the earnings which we've been discussing their obviously down 18% a lot of that has come as a result decline in top-line in revenues and in the sales if you like but they haven't been able to shift the dial on on the cost side so a lot more to be done then if you compare their cost base versus global peers there behind the curve on that so more cost cutting to come I think they've announced that it's gonna they will come out with more detail on cost cutting and at their full-year results in 3 months time or ahead of that so expect an announcement for HSBC Hong Kong or also likely to fall into recession this was said by the city's financial Secretary the official third quarter GDP figures throughout Thursday but he's warning that the political protests have impacted gig economy quite substantially yet which is actually hitting the main areas of profitability for them right now Asia's been a big source of profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong continues to have the challenging economic backdrop that could see it come on teenagers beauty come under a lot pressure moving on the French luxury goods giant LVMH Louis v Tom Merrit Tennessee to give you some idea of some of the brands reported to be bidding 14 a half billion dollars to buy American and hire and jeweller Tiffany why Yeah just like in the world of luxury they are paying up for the assets to pay up about 22% more than the current market valuation their main ambition if you like to expand into the us centre read have a global luxury group It's been an area of weakness for them if you like That's one one of the things they are motivated by frack brand as well they must pay a lot for you I mean I don't know much about the world I usually say he said Tiffany to me and it is a God of I know what you're on about that we've seen a bit more now aren't we that big companies mopping up brands Yes I know people want it is intricate a look at this yesterday I was I was perplexed by what I've read which was that a lot of the major brands are under pressure from boutiques because you thought the brands as people what people are paying for badger do a lot of people get their luxury items from some of the smaller operations which has challenged the big names having the idea of buying Tiffany a KC by higher jeweller and then when they come into buying a 50000 $ Dem diamond ring from Disney how how happy Louis CK's as well and a glass of champagne how that looks a bit brandy as well as tennis if Mike Ashley did hire jury That's what the fact in got a lot of good work also a very big week for us company results 150 of the 500 companies in the SNP are reporting results this week as an enormous names just today we have Spotify and Google owner Alphabet see big tech names Yeah and they have lots of different fortunes if you like Spotify is still in its early days and has been around for some time but it can have a lot of and variations in its earnings whereas Google has And profitable since 2003 it produces approximately 40 billion $ a quarter in top-line sales the big challenge for the market is world the regulations and anti-trust activities way down on their profitability for Google and that's all of them that is the main concern at the decision for me right now Lewis group Google music YouTube music or Spotify subscription to make the switch to go elsewhere another one mile long list of things and I'm trying to</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

bash the whatever happens the viewing in the City about the economy such I think the that the view in the hip in the city that it is the big focus is on the Brexit negotiations and the impact on investment and consumption because if investment decisions are being delayed and as we're hearing that in that clip from from people in Bradford if people have been more careful about what they are

exactly exactly and actually to some extent Carney's comments were were there could be described as Duffy Charlie that interest rates are not going to increase as quickly as the bank might forecast done in the past and and therefore that a consequent effect on Sterling but then again as far as the stock market is concerned the stock market she likes a weaker Sterling we saw a post referendum

Airways fell from the top 20 Ranking entirely the firm be more than 15 100 companies to the number one spot in the annual UK Superbrands ranking that Louise I didn't help Tesco's results last week today I saw a fall in profits and a I think it is the same they made too many bricks that that was the issue there is an oversupply in are looking at Lego profits a couple years ago now I think and remember they were just normal sleep profitable I mean enormously profitable looks its return on capital employed and I remember correctly something like 60% way above even smartphone maker Apple and I remember thinking this is such a profitable company and when the profitability that high you normally only has one way to go it would mean reversion and kick be that we are seeing at the moment that might be it keep text coming on books as well talking more about that of the rest the programme but London Mayor Sidique Khan has been speaking at the huge South by southwest conference in Texas politics not been his only target no use saying that politicians should probably do more about the big tech companies but Mr. Khan also urged those companies like Facebook and Twitter to improve their response to criticism or Sia explain to our North America technology reporter Dave Lee faced the possibility a further regulation we can't assume that tech companies all find the solutions by themselves they will be chilly and cajoled take action Germany's example of where the German government said enough your list you take down hate messages issued a takedown fake News we will find you no point is very simple I want us to use technology to create jobs in London we all love to be a byword for technology think about the data connectivity innovation I want to scale up Londoners have jobs for tomorrow's work with the tech companies but could be responsible that Siddique Khan the Mayor of London we can speak to Dave lay on the line now Dave good morning Comolli David just it was silly Khan having his keynote speech at the conference that that that seems like quite a big deal not a politician hasn't really had the Observer from the UK hasn't had that that platform before know he's the first British boxer to have a platform with so I think what he's doing here is attempting to kind of push boys typical among Britain's politicians this idea that social media companies are not doing enough to stamp out various things where there is extremism on social networks but also just general hate speech what we're expecting him to do ahead of tomorrow's was still in Sunday evening here but a Sunday night here but tomorrow Monday he guides a call-out and recite some of the messages he had on social media that just being hateful in some cases illegal one of the messages the he's had is that these messages not only other way not nice for him to receive news but anyone who might be thinking of a career in politics might be put off by saying those things directed at him so he think he's seeing the problem of social media as being a very widespread situation where people are gonna look at the experiences he's had I think you know what I'm not gonna say anything that might be combatted because I might be subjected to the same forward deals the mayor of London's been subjected to I think he sees as a real problem the councils that of course is that several times now I had British policies come to Silicon Valley to say that technology companies should be doing more these companies say what we're doing everything we can we are putting all our expertise to solve this problem having British policies come here and say do more without actually having no idea what the more it isn't particularly practical but I think it's keeping up the pressure on the company to take the issue seriously and with the added threat nothing is interesting you mentioned what happened In Germany particularly where they can levy fines of more than 50 million euros of companies for not deleting its feet I think is very pointed he's mentioning that as potentially a route to the UK might take if these companies don't solve the problem themselves and Dave I got slightly confused I thought I thought you were sort of a conference for Hitchcock films but of course that's North by north-west not a slightly confused and if you ask has been talking as well it makes the front page of the business section the Telegraph also the BBC News business News website saying that SpaceX and Tesla alive by the skin of their teeth and remember he made his money in PayPal and that's what enabled him to fund SpaceX and Tesla Yes he made his money in PayPal and need a put that money into two projects and at some point

now absolutely what I would say is that yes there is a requirement there to get some kind of software but there is quite a broad range of products available none of them free free some low-cost not buying at the moment freedom there was a proposal that some of them in the market would be but there's so many providers out there It's kind of hard to hang on everywhere everybody's providing and it will always cost option is actually if you mention excel spreadsheet there you come by what's called be bridging of where that will take the numbers from a spreadsheet and submit them to HMRC for making tax digital systems that is normally the cheapest way to do it and many have everything from that opt for a full-blown cloud accounting packages but you're right that the risk of some cost businesses here Fema Thank you very much very helpful I'm sure for lots of businesses looking at the making tax digital service Ms Rawson technical officer with the Association of tax technicians sure has been in touch saying HMRC is gonna be one of the most advanced electronic tax systems in the world said what could possibly go wrong for sure that is their aim and messages on the front page of the times front page of the Mirror Mike says stop scaring me automatic speed limiting cars will not sell that's what the front page of the papers today automatic speed limits plans for all new cars and Mike says I would rather keep mile car forever triggers broom it will be with 17 brushes and 14 handles all everyone and Summly has been in touch on Twitter using the hashtag wake up to money saying speed limiter a new cars will put Aston Martin FerrariMercedes etc act of business interesting stuff which came on the market to raise well there's this big row over the future of the internet on one side of the argument Blondie's Debbie Harry and Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and on the other side of the row and founder of the internet Sir Tim Berners Lee the battleground the new EU copyright law directive now the singer's an artist's want greater protection for their content said him or once an open internet and the artists won the European Parliament yesterday adopted laws that hold tech giants responsible if users post content with out copyright permission with still to look at this is the end Murray head of investment Hermes investment management during this is a big decision it is a big decision and it's wonderful to hear Sir Tim wanting to take the internet back to his original vision of the open internet but sadly I think that ship has sailed this is for me About clipping the wings of big tech a little bit further and mortar camel clipping the wings of big tech definitely think the European regulators are showing that they are willing to go in several different fronts here to take a detailed look at what big tech are doing in terms of their social licence to operate if you like and what does this mean for investors liking of for 4 4 the for consumers it might turn out that there is a possibility that this is going to lead to some additional costs and they will have to front up and we will the services that the Facebook's the that the YouTube and so will the Paso on to convince consumers that the question what their free at the moment advertising funded Yes so will be at advertising cover the additional costs of these services to consumers moving on this stunning fact compiled by Bloomberg that one 5th of the global investment grade bond market has a negative yield now what that means is that 20% of the top quality corporates and governments actually pay back less than they borrowed in the first place like negative interest-rate this is extraordinary you didn't even know you need to know though the fact that you're quite surprised I was stunned it was as high as 20% and this is a hangover from the global financial crisis and unconventional monetary policy was put in place to deal with it taking rates down to zero and in some cases below zero interest rate policy from me this means two things one Japan defecation so there's a strong chance certainly here in Europe we are entering an economic phase that will see as much like Japan and a very low growth rate and very low interest rates for a long long time wanted a rates in Japan decades 3 decades now Japan effectively the second thing it means for me is a zombie companies one of my favourites they are going to stick around for a while as companies that in normal course of events would go out of business but currently they are able to roll over their debt borrowings a very low interest rates and continue to work to continue to be based in business wise on the company's problematic the problematic because they are effectively sucking some of the entrepreneurial life blood from the markets that the new shoots you need to boost productivity essentially yet Murray Thank you a quick look at the markets yesterday the Footsie closed up 0.3% at 7.9 secs shares in the posh drinks maker

forefront it does brighten things up things look out for first of all for income investors those people looking for dividends this is suddenly quite a big dividend paying stocks more than 7% because the share price has gone from 13 \u00a3 down to 8 \u00a3 over the last 12 months but things I think also to look for is they've done some kelp self help initiatives trying to spend about 300 million moron technology clearly advertising market is shifting from physical advertising to the online advertising virtual advertising and but also trying to fund that has been a 275 million \u00a3 saving programme on rationalising the number of advertising agencies I think an update on that will provide further reassurance or indeed concerns investors I summon many thanks dress some French from Panmure Gordon this is BBC Radio 5 live BBC sells very good morning here this is wake up to money our McCartney sure Frank and it's 5 46 minute that travel is for the M25 anti-clockwise looking slow with two lanes closed because of a broken-down lorry between junction 24 Potters bar junction 23 South Mimms as well Thank you for the messages travel questions will see if we can squeeze on for the end of the programme lots more to go through a big big story this morning is the world's leading internet companies have written to the government setting out principles they want to see in online regulation the letter comes from the likes of FacebookGoogleAmazon and is ahead of what's been delayed government paper on online dangers duty due in the coming weeks so will this letter have an impact on that Daniel Dyball is the UK executive director of the internet Association they are coordinated this letter represent the big tech giants involved Daniel good morning good morning what one of the main things that jumped out from this letter ease the internet Association these big tech companies wanting the government to provide some distinction between Kock illegal content which is illegal and that which is merely harmful they would seem to anybody that if content is harmful he should just not be putting it online as a starting point I think that's really one of the important distinctions in this debate as the government for its white paper the content that is clearly also terrorism content for example and when something is clearly all companies can take strong action to take that down no done a lot of love for terrorism content the way content is not clearly illegal say it's in the category of harmful like maybe bullying or suicide and self-harm Images that's a different category of content and companies do work to remove the content but when we recommend regulatory framework to deal with internet harms Hall we do need to make that distinction because not all of the harms need the same types of action down to the other extreme Daniel would you be comfortable being the centre so the these principles are about government coming to a regulatory framework that is balanced so balance that allows long one and freedom of speech and innovation and on the other hand allows concerns with of content to be to be addressed last new flag one of the important issues here which we we want to have a framework that doesn't encourage over censorship content and allows people to be able to express their views online but we also need a regulatory framework that protects consumers from harm can see why earn lots of people might not be doing so interested in but requests and desires from the internet companies who seem to have been very slow off the Mark to act on particular online dangers when it takes in recent weeks the the conversation around the death of a 14 year-old is Molly Russell and then all of a sudden we hear the likes of Instagram saying we will take more action to address Images of suicide and self harm and then YouTube here yesterday saying no comments on videos that feature under ratings it feels very reactive has been Isner Working as a genuine shift in how cop it had been during their responsibilities in recent months and the tragic case of Molly Rosol inscribed took action you mentioned YouTube across the piece companies are doing more to protect users their investing in teams review content and they are investing in technology to remove harmful content but is it fair to say that they would like in many many areas that these tech giants well ahead of the game him is it fair to say they had their eyes off the ball when it came to these issues</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

paper she was being recycled has been turned back into cardboard packaging its in which all the goods we buy from China come in a package so and it wasn't it was it wasn't being recycled just the Chinese authorities and didn't want to take that material and marks where you send it now predominantly had been a big shift last year or two back towards recycling more in the UK ending and within Europe I think that's a good thing It's a great opportunity for companies Biffa where we've got does capabilities we're leading plastics recycling operations here and we really welcome the opportunity to do more of that he's cities in the UK so I am able to give us an idea of what proportion he ascended to China before and are sending any tear Asia anywhere else in Asia at the minute actually know Hillary will resume later numbers the numbers still a plastics is the biggest concern quite rightly people haven't for Biffa 90% of the plastics we sell is within the UK and of the remained almost all of the arrested within Europe hardly anything goes outside Europe that wasn't the case for holding shipped a few years ago and the Deathly work problems and there were TV programmes about that and not including are complacent while but it it was a big issue and and the system was set up by the government in such a way that companies could claim credit for recycling material just by exporting them so to far-flung countries without knowing for certain were being recycled tattoo stopping it needs to stop the government need to do moral the regulations further clump out a crime say you say you're confused by the system and the you you are not too sure why it is so confusing you had those conversations with government in the wake of the first people you if you mention this issue to so weight when you talk about the packaging in the traffic light system and all of that what is it that stopping that from happening I think you have to ask them the big brands the supermarket told you I think they let me just say I think the supermarkets themselves in fairness and if you look at their own brand products they have quite clear labelling these days what can and cannot recycle if you then look at the big brands which also stock the labelling is unclear how often he says things like where facilities exist with archery cycling logo next week what does that mean that doesn't help me isn't as an individual no whether I cannot can't put that the packaging in the recycling bin in the way Spain so we need a sink need assistance to be imposed upon all products are safe you want to sell your products here in the United Kingdom you have ducked here to this labelling system make it easier and power but our citizens so they can do the right thing because as I said I believe people want to do right thing what is still one reason did we mention stats a bit earlier Michael that the UK average recycling rate is is so much lower than the very best in Europe I think one thing we should do first look at the statistics another will get into too much detail but the the EU allows about 4 different ways of measuring recycling levels in the EU and the UK as such adopt the Conservative one of also if you're just for those levels actually are recycling level is right up there not the very top but certainly opinion probably The top of the second quarter hours certainly a level similar to Germany some say we should celebrate our success we went from being and a bit of a disgrace probably about the turn of the Millennium when now actually performed quite well but the state is just plateaued in the last few years we've completely run out of steam with $ can easy bits we've now got a we've got to go again we've got to come up with a new system where people can re-engage with this and it needs a new regulations so it needs as talked about earlier in his new role in his labelling on packaging so make it clear that people know what they can and can't recycle and we need to get these difficult things to recycle like black plastic food trays and multi material packaging how to the recycling get them redesigned as Michael top merit chief executive of the IFA this is a wake up to money's best of the bosses 2019 another big story 5 G aware of that has been making headlines the launch of in the UK the one of the big tech stories of the year the theory being one of a series give you much faster internet access on your mobile but that the use of go far and wide Mark Evans he's the boss of Telefonica which runs O2 he told us that doesn't mean they won't still be trying to improve signals across the country and particularly in remote areas when we say we're launching 5G network that doesn't mean to say we're letting up on broadening our coverage on 3G and 4G as well in fact the industry has worked together collaboratively to to reach areas the economically very challenging for us there's a proposal that the government and the regulator to take Geo graphical land mass

the United States he's gonna make ends they actually he thinks that America has had a deal on global trade he intends to put that right and say everything has been teed up Narendra Modi Justin Trudeau been trying to tell him listen please be more open in your trade policy so it'll be a very interesting punch-up attack potentially on Friday then the talking to the boss of the world's most valuable US investment bank JP Morgan and he will not be among those people Booing from the sidelines on Friday he's actually pretty big supporter of Trump he says that for too long we haven't had reciprocal trade with Americans safe free trade they mean reciprocal and actually America doesn't have that for example some countries and companies can buy 100% of the US company but it doesn't work the other way around tariffs over here are here when you try it sports us into their markets it is different on the way back said hit japes JP Morgan's Jamie Diamond will be it will be Trump called of there is this punch-up and as that word Brexit been mentioned Simon and the American banks always ready to predict Armageddon but certainly as for job losses are concerned over by calmed down a bit and well Jamie terms a very interesting case in point net in the run-up to the Brexit referendum he was saying for 1000 JP Morgan jobs could go if we voted to leave he got 60000 were talking about a quarter of the workforce in the UK that after the referendum vote that number got dialled down we currently think that between 500 and 1000 jobs will go mainly to Frankfurt so he was a bit away dismissed as part of that project fear was as bad as it will make out that subsequently he said that he's just yesterday and speaking to him he's upgrading his long-term forecast for job losses to more than 4000 if it is quite important if we can't get rich buttery alignment if they can't agree on regulation between the UK and EU However hopes that will happen there is a definite possibility that way and in that case it could be 5000 jobs he's talking about all right let's talk about Theresa may she will be making a speech later on today talking about technology giant and and the big tech companies like Facebook and Google and a few others have come in for quite a bit of stick this week haven't A there are calls for them to be regulated survey the big at the beginning of the week saying that people don't really trust them team some to moderating content properly do you think we're a big turning point for these companies it It's interesting this slightly different approaches in Europe and in America in the us if you got 89% market share for all e-commerce over Christmas which Amazon does that is seen as a triumph of innovation you get a medal in Europe they think that is a the astonishing monopolistic position to be in and they would seek to try and think about breaking up so there's to use the two issues here there is the market share and the effective digital monopolies the likes of Google and Amazon have that is a worry to some people and then you've got that you say is moderating content this is a really interesting one because when you ask the companies like Facebook and Google what are you doing to try and get rid of extremist content or unpleasant content they say we will beef up our team we've got internal battles we've got we've got thousands of people looking at this it's a pretty odd thing because it away who who decides to these companies what is acceptable and what is not a they got some internal start chamber where they make these really very big editorial judgments about what can go out there they have they they move their position saying we're not police force with of editors were not publishers to basically be saying OK we quasi except that we could do something we're going to do it frost selves please don't do it can they the right people to do it It's been a very very big almost philosophical issues about who decides who runs the internet and Donald Trump Theresa may and John McDonnell have a job I think all these well John McDonnell is quite interesting as John McDonnell and Donald Trump have one thing in common both of them say they hate that Cos they like to become a global elite Melissa the back scratching and shoulder-to-shoulder stuff that happens here Sir John McDonnell particularly a fish out of water it may be in this crowd but he of course has been saying look we've got a perfectly good financial credentials earlier this year he's saying we've been talking to asset managers about what might or might not happen to the \u00a3 if we had a Corbyn McDonnell victory so I think he's trying to burnish his credentials saying listen we are credible financial outfit's we can mix it here we've got we would have nothing to apologise for I think that's why he's here but as yet it will be interesting at the tree at Israeli troops are due to meet a little bit later in the week the original that wasn't going to

the industry Richard to try earn his chief commercial officer professional services particularly the focus here at Cambridge consultants moaning Howard who's the founder and chief executive of tech start-up start be handwriting a Broad spectrum of the tech sector their jobs and religious kick-off with you because your boss at TechUK to UK said the last few days that minister's views on data rules was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how EU rules and data protection work that data what Firstly what did he mean by ministers not really understanding what goes on in the world of tech data also think one thing that breaks it is like to machines around you there are so many moving parts and there are some ministers who really really getting and there are some who for various reasons are outside the tech space and maybe think that all we need to change the way we work in order to do better trade deals with the us or elsewhere what would David CEO TechUK was saying was that actual some light data where hard data protection standards are really important not just for the sector being able to move from the personal data across the EU UK border but also actually consumers can trust their data is being used properly and safely they don't want to see standards watered down what they want to see is a high standard meeting the EU level standard something called GDP are general data protection regulation they want to retain that the UK and then build on that to do the kind of trade deals that the the international trade Secretary Liam Fox wants to see we all want to make the UK a hub for tech around the world the question is whether we do that by reducing standards for bringing them up from the English on the bringing up at but you could bring up standards but that if the UK had in a bit of independence into what standards it was implementing we could we could maybe set more appropriate standards we would like to that would encourage more businesses in while maintaining the security folk customers businesses so the key thing is what you're doing with those standards as you change we know she can be really innovative about stuff so for example the government recently announced think the centre of the data ethics innovation that will give us the opportunity look at some new challenges coming up in areas like AI and set some really interesting global standards what we don't want to do is reduce the a base level of data protection which we need in order to legally be allowed to transfer data across the EU UK border if we break that it makes it much harder for companies to do the kind of things which a lot of tech relies on like building algorithms which assessed data could bring date back to the UK assesses to figure out what's going on then be able to improve products and interest Richard and at AI has been a big thing for the science Park seen a lot of the big tech firms putting their investing into the Park and doing research from there to advancing the likes of as Alexa machines and Google homes home that that's what one of the main focuses of TechUK for Cambridge consultants when you look at the tech sector and the relationship with the European Union what is the key thing for you I think that I've certainly big theme It's significant because it touches every industry technology is helping us to be smarter world to live better lives serious help medical and sector but for us as a professional services company in the centre of all of that are businesses about helping companies to develop new technologies and providing fresh qualified services do that so human talent is in the centre of the European Brexit agenda for us access to the best possible people that we can access around the world to ensure that we can compete on a global scale we've heard from the government that actually high-skilled people seem quite likely to be able to get the visas they need it we will talk Not very often said the hospitality sector the agricultural sector where its lower income lower skilled workers they require a lot of voters and happened if the rescue had an injury so much a problem for tech you get your people so we are quite confident that we will certainly see no people leaving or organisations results of recent activities but it is not so that people aren't pausing to consider moving to the UK so we need some certainty to end as quickly as possible and actually in the technology sector moved so quickly that we need access to very specialist deep expertise at the point in time we need it if that isn't available to us without a lack of confidence that becomes a problem we sometimes get those now from outside the European Union the around 12% of our staff on site in the UK are European Union nationals so maintaining masses important to us and it is that it is a delicate balance believe when you're running a start-up and the Eve of the you don't know</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

UK has risen by 100004.1 million That's according to new government figures which also show that more than two-thirds of those children in working families Meanwhile the BBC has been given research about families who go to food banks our special correspondent Ed Thomas has been looking at this somewhat more then do today's figures tell us will this is relative poverty that we're talking about so

then back again do that was caught you buy car which they should do more they should arrange their own private jet what could they have done a pause I think that would trigger an award I did strike Cardiff City's actions their decisions that behaviour during this whole affair political rewards to them I did not I but elsewhere I do not see you have seen the interim report by the air accidents investigation branch earlier this week and the concern has been raised about whether or not the pilot missed it so should have been flying commercial flight and it seems he should've been the scene of the plane He will not licensed for a commercial arrangement only for cost sharing what was your reaction to that finding the report here maybe it a sales and the the they told us that it is more than you put enough sleep the Tories also the pilot in the Anderson was done is really cool and it was also a bookie to fly the plane when youth for up for a taxi and the taxi comes you don't ask and you have to buy a licence the or as a caddie more teed is distended just when you think about this distinction work yet the body back all we get is what she wanted the clearly is not a Cardiff yes what was happening but obviously they ignored because he was winning the airport from Colin back well well the finger-pointing is going on there is a family received in trying to come to terms with the loss of a son and brother It's just desperately sad sad story its 6 23 Sean Farrington is here for wake up to money fame and we're talking about the tech giant's this morning making their pitch to the UK about how they should be regulated this has been so much in the news recently about companies like Facebook at which raised Instagram WhatsApp and Twitter the to be more responsible for the cut harmful content that appears online yet at some point in the coming weeks maybe months already been delayed expecting the government to publish some kind of paper saying these are the kind of laws we want to see implies about how these companies are regulated late last night our media editor Amol Rajan got his hands on this in this letter from the internet Association has called this is it the trade body that represents all those big tech companies like Facebook like Google like Amazon where they make their pitch to the government to say this is what we think should happen and where we are the areas we think should be focused upon the key one being how do they think harmful online activity should be related regulated and the difference between things that are illegal and things that adjust say just that are harmful and they want some clarity from the government on on wake up to money we spoke to David dye ball lose the UK executive director of the internet Association and I asked him why it's taken so long for the internet companies to make such big statements like this I think the press industry is stepping up to now to his right but people would like this one not 10 years ago when these companies are starting to do so well well the industry is is still relatively young in comparative terms and as industries grow industries need to take more responsibility and then gets regulatory framework that allows companies to protect users so I think now is a good moment in time Frost having this debate on content regulation and Have these principles will allow the government to get balanced and proportionate regulatory framework a proportion is interesting riot Yes because in there is still said they would rather no regulation and still need to grow he said and then that we didn't have time to get into every single angle but that is one big debate around it do these companies actually need to grow story which caught my eye this morning has happy upgrading announced of not yet announced they are going to produce a more affordable model what they had this model basically in the pipeline for some time but their cars a phenomenally expensive now they have announced they will sell the model 3 at something like 35000 $ about 28000 \u00a3 still a lot of money it is but much more affordable than the previous one it Yeah it's a big he is a big change for a company like Tessa it would have been like back in the day he rolls Royce saying at some point you know what we're actually the drug maker Dell board Yeah an affordable one and because Tesla very much seen as being a luxury cars even though its technology very advanced electric car industry very good</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

yeah easy well yes we are going to talk about one was happening at the cass wille in just a moment let's talk about the story 1st you're right agree that aims to target so-called Islamic state group's online activities claimed it was behind the attack which caused the BBC website to crash for several hours and he's leaving Monday expressed itself this problem the iPlayer was affected a group calling itself new world hacking says it carried out the attacks is a test of its own capabilities tell us more the lurid well this group actually got in touch with me I was gonna wear to the airport Saturday morning and I got a message on Twitter saying we are the people we have had activists who actually not bbc.co.uk of Lorraine Ahmed an ulcer of approve they gave me some evidence it's always impossible to say whether this is true or not but they did seem to be vaguely convincing ba ba says he their group set up to take down boys is affiliated websites our and this was just a test of their capabilities it quote it was only a test within exactly plan to take it down for multiple hours as the was a quite strong it is the 8th of the fire this garden and it would be more effective than I thought it was a cow was abuses said about well the BBC throughout this as has not given any details of thing the policy generally with companies that come under this attack is to say as little as possible because Adrian Warner encourage the hackers the the how activists and the they know they'll all be given any information about just how successful it been so that they can change their tactics in future at the BBC's merely said it came under technical be had a technical issue didn't even confirmed they had been an attack but we know that there was one hour the the group themselves say their group based in the United States they will answer to a colleague of mine late last night that there were 8 8 men and 4 women and they attach to Klux Klan websites before now there were 5 hissing on ice' this but the BBC's into be on that is the other reason we really targeted BBC is because we wanted to see at actual so overpower this was just a test of power we don't usually take to websites like it's right seems a bit amateurish dozen what it does and in particular when we know there's other groups already targeting the so-called Islamic states online activities and they don't seem to be here aged in their and a vector the your this garden ladies get on with the job but anyway let's talk about thank you for all of them let's talk about cs for Eric is the just to put into context rallies this this is a massive Bill isn't really is this this is when the big boys set out their stall for the next year it's the big tech festive does that get under way to wednesday but the couple of lanes having Monday night and during Tuesday the what happens is that's a 100 and 50000 people descend en masse they is all the big technology players and it was quite often more interesting is it small start-up businesses showing off their wares so the themes they share things like virtual reality were hoping to hear more about HTC's new virtual reality hits the htc 5 virtual reality it said a lot of drones more drones just as concern grows about their impacts and and regulations begin to get tighter and a lot of the car industry's can be pitching up here which is quite interesting is actually the big event for the car industry is the week after the Detroit motor show but a lot of it now seems to be moving to las Vegas to to join up with the at the electronics companies because they see the threat from Silicon Valley they are saying we don't really want to go SL to take the lead here we can show off what weakened self driving staff and all other ok Rory thank you very much

coming through Osho its Ovo energy the it a star energy company called out the last few years it's eaten into the energy market a bit of the big 6 one of the smaller company's am an ECO energy companies to well it has EU coat tariffs slice and certainly one point was pushing those quite a bit now has with hundreds of thousands of customers Ofgem the regulator has launched an investigation into them because it is questioning the accuracy of the consumption data that over was given its customers so effectively if customers centre over right how much in electricity was using last year how much gas was that by using last year Ofgem is investigating whether the that response from Ovo was actually accurate and the reason that would be important because these days we're told me all the time switch switch switch and the way to get the best deal when switching is to put in your consumption data into various comparison sites you might do that if the information you're being given among those incorrect that then will change how you you're the results that come up when you do the search is now at the minute the regulator is not saying anything about it they're not implying any no incorrect about the data so you're saying what the size of your house how many people living here is literally the target the number of men mega Watts you you're using IVF megawatt hours that's what you're asking over for what you can you work out a new meter as well rise for you but you might be asking over for more information a lot of the new energy companies have in that apps that have forced the big energy companies with more traditional ones to absorb be a bit more innovative in the day-to-day giving us over as one of the companies that has done that regulator at the minute not saying there is any anything wrong with what over of done but clearly they got some concerns about what's gone on so they have launched an investigation will be very interesting want to follow that through to see if Ovo have been given accurate information for customers those customers Here's pick-up all over the country and also talking about how the tech companies are doing the big tech come pay Yes a lead these companies that have long been a big disrupters in various markets in the last few days who have these financial results we get lots of companies but it's been in America has been the big tech companies updating us how they're doing and you really get a sense of what's going on in our lives when you look at where they are making money said Apple billions and billions and billions of pounds of profits yet again but selling fewer iPhones in the last quarter of a rush of last year than they were the year before which came as a bit of a surprise to some particularly as they had all the hype around the iPhone next iPhone 10 which everyone corner selling fewer but it because it was more expensive that iPhone around the world you can forecast 1000 \u00a3 for one if you want these days they actually were still making more money previously but the question Mark now around them wealth that question marks about Apple as a company but around the iPhone can they keep producing these products Amazon in big profits again but then people would expect more profits Amazon but they keep investing in many many different products they don't quite have the profits that the likes of AppleGoogle and Facebook make but the Amazon showing once more they got things in a lot of pride a lot of pies that Alexa products doing pretty well with jam Mattie Luton in wake up to money the early from Enders analysis research analyst there he said you can read a lot into how our lives change with how Amazon is changing Amazon keeps surging ahead so other all these companies they are perhaps the one within the high is sort of ambition in terms of really covering all areas of the consumer economy there just announced they are moving into healthcare and they've just bought a whole foods in and in Rio grocery retail their club services business surging ahead so I'm like other companies Amazon is not sitting in a huge pile of cash cash comes in goes other investments they really know what they're doing they're really going for it and that's a really interesting story go forward their bid chatter around whether we might see one of these companies hit two trillion dollars in worth this year Google as well up there that will be quite a landmark and shows the significance they have on our lives that they can make some when Apple sold 80 billion dollars worth of phones in 3 months cultures are meant I could do it annoys me that I I know not everyone has an Apple people who don't have an Apple phone are very passionate about not having an Apple phone but it does annoy me how

behaviour the reason Aberdeen doctor just a second Ruth higher there as Stefan Welwyn garden City morning staff of my name I Francisco Opera's year excellent independent banking analyst colour Francis a always lovely to have you and Sean Farrington Moreno We're gonna list list the boss of TSB in just a moment or two first of all no apologies for returning to this topic but I thought to be quite good to broaden it out to ask people not just about the TSB situation and the TSB experience but about the banking sector at the moment high Street banking sector a quick overview Sean largely banking sector communities changing rapidly this is it on the high Street are seeing fewer and fewer branches and you're seeing much more of a push online digitally by a lot of banks this what we're talking

chief executive of TSB is one set all seriousness TSB has caused this problem TSB should be to provide a service to our customers we haven't provided that service film and customers like I feel sugar and should get in touch with is all I can say we have a team waiting to talk to Phil and people like feel we will work through what we think he think is reasonable that the last thing we will be doing is penny-pinching when we are dealing with the issue our customers TSB has always put customers it cooks I read you Carla missed the news he said Yes the start of the process of moving to TSB to

ambassadors we evict them with percent long grass through them people and send them abroad it's always been that way you can't do any damage it had a good lead and make art in Jarrow reportedly hear about Boris I did think a different way I think Boris bashing a free ride on this one said I personally think Boris has done nothing wrong side face a good week he could make these make a bad week doesn't matter the good week could link to now in contrast France to a more confrontational line with America this week they introduced a new 3% tax on digital services the 30 companies will have to pay include some from France Britain and Spain and this is dominated by American firms in particular Facebook and Google the us has ordered an inquiry into the move which could lead to retaliatory tariffs on French goods the French finance Minister mineral there wasn't anyone dictate France's tax policy France is a sovereign nation we take decisions related to taxation issue as a national law and sovereign nation I call on do US administration and my counterparts to the minutiae to accelerate the job that we are currently making within just 7 within the voices you can find an international solution on digital taxation Salander and men are on the face of it somebody standing up to these big corporations saying pace and text seem like a good idea it does is a tricky one isn't it because this is all about those really large companies paying tax where they have a physical presence and those companies argue that they are meeting the current international tax laws which they thought of our but others will argue that those laws are outdated and need to be modified to keep up with the times and the Super internet companies I think the trouble is France could be opening itself up to to be getting into very messy of tit for tat standing with France with Trump maybe we should be but is that something France wants to start to the very my we have a tax as planned ourselves put 2% which tells you something there's gonna be market competition between countries and not ironic to me that though London we go through the Brexit process and on the one hand many Brits are saying we ought to be sovereign on the eatery 700 more closely the reason this isn't an EU initiative wasn't the Brits it was the Irish checks to sweeten the Finns all objects in France said Welsh back-row Blair would go do ourselves Alain that is not the way if your colleagues in the subject you're trying to an overarching agreement shortly the right thing to do was try to convince them rather than do it because they got the result is obvious retaliatory tariffs we all had trouble behaves he could have any already said I bet you a French back of seducing the French then fall from this passion and have to rein back I reckon that they will stick with it it will be incredibly difficult because in order to deal with the big tech companies GoogleFacebookMicrosoftApple any effort has to be international on Facebook I think one of the most interesting ones because Facebook is Erm at the same time there's a lot of controversy about the use of data now was launching a crypto-currency Apple as well got a European banking licence as a credit card Google got European banking licence as well so we've got the sort of mind in which big Tech's now starting strike to try to reinvent itself as a big bank and our regulators are simply not equipped to deal with it at all the Bank of England for instance has invited big tech to use science facilities which is normally only for quite tightly regulated commercial banks so I think that it's a very positive thing that a sovereign nation is trying to take steps not just attacks but to regulate these huge companies but if if undertaken in isolation it is doomed to we need we need called decisive corporate action had probably needed a common market something that will reason in this Be that is why we work that the gains you have from attacks are theoretical because businesses all result law argue the case and will take years for a pay anything they want to pay anything at all but the things that subject retaliatory tariffs the French wine luxury goods and so forth that actual money which will be stopped very quickly then the Americans had hurt when they do retaliatory tariffs to put them Macron co will be besieged by French businesses saying we are losing money and potentially jobs now for the benefit you may well never actually get I'm at the French embassy EUR from tax went so badly from the French that no bad third good week week when school uniforms in words which then had to be gender neutral in future guidelines will come into force this September which says that state schools should not have a uniform codes say Charles's up boys saw good of girls they also say schools can't insist on particular suppliers or items that have expensive school badges for example the aim is to make them

million members to the UK many many millions and millions of tens of millions billions around the world and in its 50 million users in the United States that Facebookis really coming under the cosh for 50 million users now the reason for this is because it looks like their data has been used perhaps illegitimately illegally certainly without their permission in some circumstances explain the story behind Yeah I am that's the key bit really Facebookthat touch relaunch a big review now to work out whether this personal data 50 million users had been compromised after these allegations we have seen in the last few days after the whistleblower in the Guardian had given information allegations of misuse by data analysis company that company was called Cambridge Analytica now in this goes back to 2014 when one academic used had a relationship with Facebookand had agreed with them that he could have an Apple effectively something that would enable users of Facebookto do a personality test as you often see the the games and quizzes come up on your Facebookfeed to take part one of these tests they actually get paid a small amount of money for it 270000 users back now that data was allegedly sold on to a company called Cambridge Analytica and it's not just the data there are 207000 users when they agreed to use the app they were also agreeing as often people might be familiar with this if you've done this yourself agreeing to the for the app to access deep details of their friends on Facebookthat's where you get to the 50 million users Facebookdenied any Bronte wrongdoing Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing but MPs including Damian Collins feel like they may have been misled because Facebookand Cambridge Analytica have spoken to the select committee previously Let's bring in Damian Collins now a good morning to you chair of the culture media and sport committee you feel like you've been misled would definitely because we ask questions about its capabilities relationship this organisation Cambridge University and whether they received data from them and we were told the hearing that they haven't and so that that question we will go back to them and understand to know why it was they weren't able to talk about that we also asked the question about potential data breaches had to deal with of their relationship with organisations like Cambridge Analytica was a game we have received very unclear answers but I think the big issue here I think lots of people who've got taste profiles and pages probably not aware of just how much data was collected from those pictures about but then held who's used by marketing companies choose to target messaging out of and in this case in particular what's important is that surveys all data with people people have given about It's just a Daily interest in life were also used to support political campaigns as well again I think many people would be uncomfortable I am aware that the backers of well as a sign that this is more than just about trying to influence the pair of shoes you buy this is potentially trying to influence which way you'll vote or even how you think but we are talking about the case was focused very much on America is concerned that the same kind of processes were happening here in the UK silly there will be a concern of course can be a little there is a British company so I think if the focus in particular on how others view of America but through the hard we are running a committee looking at this more generally and also what safeguards are in place about the way people think is being used and also to say should we make sure that the regulatory bodies we have in this country people like information commissioner later greater powers to get into big tech companies and check how they are using data at the moment the large amount of making a request is coming through automation not be able to go in and see for themselves so I think these be all important issues about people's privacy weather data used in their responsibility to tackle they have to keep that Weir group Yeah it's a little bit about user awareness as well isn't it how many times you tick one of those boxes in order to access the website may be through Facebookor a different profile just to get through to say yes you can have my data and do whatever you want with it without really thinking about it it but a budget that's a really important point because I sleep in a data protection laws just even if you tick tick box the terms and conditions so that huge great document read properly a company does not have had the right to take your things right away you tick the box they have worked responsibly to you could still challenge coming like that if you felt that they had that you were days away he didn't understand the Met's leak ritual writers sit under the data protection law but we also want to ask you about gambling if May Sean back Yes Dame I just wanted to ask we've been talking all morning about the gambling Commission they're not are they have said this morning that they would like a maximum stake of 30 \u00a3 or lower on fixed-odds betting terminals in the bookmakers on the high street lots</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

blustery showers some heavy and wintry on the hills very windy as well tonight very windy with severe gales developing in places Northern and western parts will have showers there will be heaviest in

for Aston Villa against Spurs last quarter 13 versus Newcastle then have your say on 6 6 the UK's biggest faiths this is 5 live morning John Pienaar welcome to Pienaar's politics well we know that what Boris Johnson's new government looks like it looks like Boris Johnson or at least a cabinet full of people will do what he wants when their bus was still don't know that much about what the Johnson region will do all sorts of ways of of pursue the goal of keeping him in Downing Street to Cae they want for example to spread wealth and opportunity beyond the capital and the south-east and in that way how normal to reduce supporters in the North but how the Minister has been handed the of developing a Northern powerhouse Grant Shapps is live on shirt so I asked him since he's the transport Secretary we will find out how he needs to make sure the trains run on time we don't know yet how Labour might go about opposing the government apart from rubbishing everything they do I mean that's because the party is still choosing a leader if it's up to shadow Chancellor John McDonnell the new leader would be very like the old political why does he think the next election might be third time lucky for the deep dive left he's right now we can say Hi to Asia has a regional editor of the evening Standard's Londoner's diary former Labour advisor Ayesha good to see you back again and some sharp we witness a former special adviser to the former chancellor Sajid Javid to this week's re-shuffle very much present contributor to today's show summer I was in your mind well I mean beginning just that the shock of femme with the death of Caroline and flak think everybody was this very surprised about it and think big questions are going to be asked about its end press and media conducted itself they were all responsible as well in terms of social media as well not just the big tech giants how we conduct ourselves and certainly questions of the CPS by think that is a huge shock and the other story that caught my eye is end the fact that the government is now launching an attack on the BBC saying they want to get rid of the licence fee and introduce subscription model I think look the BBC is not without fault but my goodness we would miss it if it was a goner I'm not saying that I'm sat here at the BBC I think there's a huge amount of m programming pictures were Not happen if it tended to just been pure these of commercial entity if you're asking everyone to come down the track not so far off should anybody really Sundays at times some Europe as you and your reflections formed now since the the reshuffle seeing your former boss become a former Chancellor Yes do and obviously a lot of my end of the week has been taken up by the of reshuffling sort of what's happening and picking and packing yet I am not sure I've come to a definitive conclusion I'm sure by tomorrow morning you will change again but I do it with Dyson agrees that one of his big the biggest things that we've been looking at is social media and it made me think about online harm which again is in the papers this morning of man the government's policy towards regulating

to be all sorts of things I also think you might get so called high profit Katie taxes which very groundwork ring-fencing taxes the NHS would be a classic target for that when people make it past play right Here's one his attacks an annual tax to fund the health service it costs about 100 and said 60 billion including social care I think it is a the NHS's about 120 130 billion and we will raise that with a hypothecated tax in June if they brought in now most people go on the doorsteps and clapped for so Grace view I E a radical idea on this so we all agreed taxes will go up which taxes then what would you suggest cracked I think pulling the conduct of the question you are out and about that how did they bring back to austerity there is a question of find the country if slightly poorer how are we going to get back to a situation where we can kind of cheap broadly shared prosperity again but the question we don't really know but right wing politicians ask who it will be paid for paying for that now they will always say we're all in this together and everyone will take it out but he did end up being under austerity with that as the pressure of life The poorest working people and society to afford to pay for financial crisis was caused by the excesses of the rich now if you were in a different situation that we will see we will within it after many many years the banks and businesses saying government should cut regulation cut pack to get out of the economy they're all at the door of number 11 saying can we have learned we have a bailout and again when the quake though that they can go back to saying the government is to cut taxes we need to see less regulation elect someone that I want to see is that in exchange for emergency support being provided to big business at the moment the emergency support being provided them well here people in the country and conditions attached to that back making sure that these accompany and treat their workers well they're not really seriously damaging the environment all of those things and then we come Q the post crisis economy I want to make sure that it is those who actually profited from this crisis because there are company has seen a big tech companies in particular they get a profit she would market potentially also wore what we get I think again and make them a little bit complicated point but the bank of England could do with it after the financial crisis and basically create blow that money and use it to buy certain crap basically and that had the effect of pushing up asset prices across the board it he made people who were shot dead while yet make people who are not having a little bit wealthier will need to see that the bank could do that again achieve more should be thinking tax on that well off the people well go up income the stagnant that will be a real problem they need to be asking the question of how we can get back to a prosperous economy we should all be asking the question who will pay for it and if the someone telling you we need to make cuts to welfare and who will pay I think we should be very efficient the that it's what about other capital levy all a one off type of the cake to tackling say right everyone's but then got paid a lot of money once stood at the height of the day the NHS to get the NHS back on track could that be sold as something of a radical potentially depending on the amount we eat array of course the other thing is that if you really needed a quick injection of money then it's basically free for the government to borrow right now and yet over the longer term it could be a situation where people who are buying government debt actually and telling the government hold their debt when making money of government debt would be kind of silly not to use that pay for any emergency spending longer on over a longer time ordinary working people currently that bad there are quite a big burden of taxation in the country why would like to see if they buy an excess profits tax where companies they would be able to cut profit massively from the earthquake that pay a huge portion of that thought he had added worry exactly what we had during the second world war and with excess profit tax for this company and a wealth tax package on big capital gains that they think they own money in Amazon's stock or something before the crisis that sort of stuff I think short very very cheap borrowing and then a longer time to think about we are being attacked not just working people that came here everyone that make do you care to respond to a excess profit tax we see it it didn't work in the end does it because picking out accountants will find a way of just how good the profits well I don't think we should be and adopting what could be described as a punitive</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

can go they've got issues themselves because it's really complicated there are places but at the minute is quite hard to find out as an individual where to go what to do so what have we got an ombudsman already the internet you just think the internet is such a massive part of our lives Yes I think it is hard to structure them I'm not totally sure what I personally think it's exactly the right governance to get big peak about it we have an ombudsman we have the information Commissioner's office which side your listeners may be aware of but they're small team they have overloaded with things I think what happens is people go all kinds of different places you might turn to consumer rights organisation lots of viewers know overloading the police if they have suffered from online crime understandable but the police have the resources or the experience to be able to solve some of these problems so I'm just arguing and everyone is arguing that we need to look at the macro landscape of where all these different places are and tied them up a bit and make it really clear what rights people have and where they can go to haven't sorted out what the other interesting things that come back your survey is that a lot of us don't really know how much information tech companies hold on us can take information asking us they know now they definitely can't do that before I was a bit of a faux for the line but the am later latest data protection regulation which is coming in in the middle of this year actually does shift the balance quite profoundly in favour of us as users so now companies have d'Italia their collecting data and that's as true as if they're calling on the telephone as it is if you're on the internet so that's quite a big shift but as you say people still don't really understand why would they nearly 90% of respondents said they just don't like the terms and conditions and find impossible I'm still wondering who the other 10% who say they are OK but anyway so long I mean I never read sometimes 26 pages he's got that time my life no one I think this is something I really believe we can use a bit of stick with the tech companies to really rethink what those terms and conditions for All because in a way that gets to the nub of how they want to treat us as users and how they're trying to her arm make sure we understand or not what they're doing with the information that they are taking so that from is such an easy win away to just make it an absolute imperative to simplify their terms and conditions I think companies get really ahead of this they started to do this themselves so whose responsibility is it is it the tech companies or is it the government to clamp down on some false force I think as with everything It's a combination of the tuna another group of people into that too which is just so I absolutely think that there are still more that the tech sector itself can do I'm a huge tech optimist I work in the sector my whole life I think that the still a capacity for brilliance and innovation and improve people's lives is enormous but I think we have to look at whether Bender responsibility are I think you're absolutely right government also need to play a broader role government is making some noises in different areas clamping down on social media companies and extremism looking at how children what kind of access children to the internet and what access people have two children data but there is more so it is both parts the equation and then last year I think we now at a point where we can't just sleepwalk into using technology is more important than that we should understand what their town transaction when making these companies is I think we can if we don't like it we can change it right with people giving over information and if we want to stop doing that we are still in power for individuals and we can use our idols to change the dynamic and efficient come too hard on the internet because the bottom line is all of our lives have been affected and many people would say ended saying your survey positive absolutely no the the backdrop is still positive It's not that suddenly no one wants to use tech has a lot of talk at the minute about the tech lash against the big tech giants and these are complex important problems everything from how much tax they paid to how people treat their workers to something close to my heart gender the these companies there are a lot of issues but that my mind as someone I can say is he's worked in technology their whole working life feels to me that this is part of the of the teenage years maybe the mid-life crisis some 45 It's only my mid-life crisis that the internet is going through we had all this rapid growth of companies remember even 15 20 years ago GoogleFacebookAmazon they didn't really exist not profoundly in our lives so now I think the moment thing OK for the next period of our time what kind of society do we want what we want a relationship technology to be how we want to use it Let's demands different things we're happy you're on the board of TwitterTwitter be doing more I can't speak to it as a director but very much because that's not really appropriate as a director the company but I believe they have a responsibility I don't know what I would say is that I think it has an enormously important role to play in public conversation you can see everything from black lives matter to meet tutor hear things that have been happening all over the world is incredibly valuable resource that's why I love being on the board there is a huge amount going on to try and address the problems that people face feel they face on the platform and all I would say is this is new and hard I'm not apologising for what happens on the internet but some of the magic that people must feel it must easily able to sort this out the technology</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

you have passed 12 next heads of AmazonAppleFacebook and Google owner Alphabet have been defending their companies against claims the abuse of Paul are to squash competitors they appeared before US lawmakers comes as some critics are calling for tougher regulation of somebody wanting to see the firm's broken up Riley and covered the hearing from the Washington post so Tonya They are real and UK funky help us understand what these firms have been accused of doing way so to present birth the hearing was very much ahead they text back a reckoning and I think that's what we got yesterday the bottom line here is that these companies are you big and in the process they're posh there are complications there making it so that smaller companies care come up in the same way and that's really what we saw on the evidence presented yesterday if the question for got to remember though that is something many what questions were asked the toughest questions us rate so I think honestly the strongest line of questioning Kim again game as a lion and what's interesting here is just be a sea of banners and have never gone to press Congress for further should a lot of tech reporters waiting for this and you know I think he just didn't see that prepared and there was a really great question about the reporting I have been dying and this is an issue that's gone on in Europe as well but there are allegations that Ms Ahrendts uses some of the deal it did from defence sellers on its platform basically created some products they can keep the other the death basis cannot say that he was 100% sure that the company had not done that he said that there are well she'll but you certainly can't say with any certainty that that practice has gone wants I think that was very you know I think and learn the these companies are powerful and at the end of the day because they've created a product that we all want of course the part for their successful why we polishing them from being successful why I think the argument is that they are successful because the way that the USS Ponce that there are complications in the way that the economy has worked in the past the argument now is that we no one else can get to the position that because they dominate the economy here and the way they are and he helped as much as we got the part Now and Google are in a way like what we're giving you all these great free-spirited people I've there are other alternatives I added a world where Google has been ticking I do you think it's a very bad deal and I think we've become so used to this kind of be very very companies but it is not inevitable and thoroughly not something that it should go without questioning is some of what Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook had to say this but at the same when Facebook bought WhatsApp we can compete against all-comers used to charge 10 sent a text message and none more now people can March video get groceries delivered and some private messages for free that competition new companies are created all the time all over the world and history shows that we do keep innovating someone more place every company here today is the right time you I mean I think Congress would say no would have the other pieces of evidence that came out in a hearing yesterday where the email exchange piece but also acquired Instagram the photo sharing app and some of these exchanges essentially applied that Facebook acquired in the Graham in order to quash the competition and everything else from the ground down there basically implying that if he didn't tell people but keep all that effort with this story company I don't know that you can have competition rise above all they had the big tech giant require them around them out of business the other leads the likely outcome of all of this if These big companies shift their lobbying and and their reasoning is not believed that like is there any prospect of any of these companies being broken up why he broke breaking up the company was thought to be as far as we go I think elite in turn around what will happen next and currently the committee chairman David to Fellaini who relished the

this individual story because I'm a number of people have been arrested OK and but do you think just generally not Daily Mail headline has got a knife crime Lyme disease you think this is something that is sweeping across the country I think the problem with knife crime in particular and we've seen all across the world is that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy if you are a young person or an older person in a certain area of the country and you I'm a knife crime is becoming a problem what you start to do in order to defend yourself you take a knife with you we know it's a monster be true that young people who have a knife with them it intentionally or not Obst ostensibly for their own defence do is massively increases the likelihood of getting involved in you know involved in conflict with somebody and stabbing them that's why it's a self fulfilling prophecy and away be within reach a change of pace from Theresa may and Sajid Javid about stop and search around 4 or 5 areas of the country by increased today yet made the challenge is that Theresa may had previously clampdown regulations to ensure that stop and search couldn't be conducted as freely though if not reversed on that and 5 areas of the country as you say it's now easier to conduct stop and search to take these knives away from people and the problem is in a way you know talking about as the disease not for help or not sure if I'm not really what that does what the Kop the implications of that word are but we can say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy and it's a cycle that we continue to spin faster and faster and faster unless we are able to do two things one is to is to challenge mitigate against the consequences of the long-term effects but also the short term effects and what do you make Pfizer third stop and search powers being changed 9 well part of the reason that they stop and search powers were taken away was because they are found to be how they were found to be racist essentially that was not just Labour that was the Tories are found to be similar in actually when you look at the driving factors what needs to knife crime one of the big ones is exclusion from scores now we know that when kids are excluded from schools the likelihood of them end up in prison and knife crime and the rest of it goes up massively because they are pin separate institutions and medicine to be made to feel like they rejected saying look if we're gonna do something about this them we need to really think about the underlying drivers Let's look at how exclusions are working right now let's look at what we can do to keep kids in school have extra support etc torso to weaken and squeeze in the story from his flat sometimes I get very quickly this is just one I think is really interesting a real change of pace Mark Zuckerberg wrote a piece for the Washington post calling for more regulation of the internet he talks about rewriting rewriting the rules of the internet this is a real break from his normal kind of rhetoric which is always been about self regulation under self regulating culture of Silicon Valley what I see this is a bit of an abdication of responsibility atrocities like and like Christ Church and them Cambridge Analytica have suddenly been the straw that broke the camel's back what Mark Zuckerberg is realise is that Facebook can not do this all by itself does not want to take responsibility for regulation and argue they can't do it by themselves but in the past he's always argue that they can do it by themselves he appeared in front of Parliament across the world most notably the Senate America and the European Parliament insisting that Facebook would do more and regulation from the national government would not always be necessary finally realise they can't do that and the reason for that I think is because he knows that self-regulation is always perceived as being unfair to somebody and and accusations of infringement on free speech truck Cummins getting somebody else make decisions for saying the ONS ft article and well the ft article reports that he's looking up for areas that need to be regulated privacy 5 but Pfizer election integrity harmful content and dad of 4 of those aged Yeah I mean I think people are estimated to Agree with that's where action is needed but again people are questioning the motives of this and one thing is there's been a growing backlash agains of the Facebooks of the wild for all we know what has been exposed 3 very different elections and referendums and and the use of data etc and this is a little bit of a PR job film and also I agree I think this is a bit of luck pointing finger elsewhere abdicating responsibility and that is certainly a change attain and I wonder if firms Nick Clegg been there has anything to do with this because he is of course advising on sort of thing now one of the positive outcomes of think of this could be when the imputed start to fall and governments as opposed to these big tech social media companies themselves government have been historically behind the times comes attack we saw with drones at Heathrow airport earlier in the year we've seen it with this technology finally think the government needs to save itself we need to take some responsibility here as well It's a difficult question I think governments have been avoiding and very quickly just want to get in</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
