'So what we will say in the paper in a very lawyered up language is, let's pause and figure out if there are any [situations], and if any, under what circumstances facial recognition remotely should be authorized', she said. Her comments reflect the EU's recent cancellation of plans to introduce a five-year moratorium[4] on the technology.EU seeks to differentiate itselfVestager has become one of the most high-profile EU politicians through her work as the bloc's competition commissioner, where she slappedSilicon Valleygiants with multiple billion-dollar fines, leading the New York Times[5] to dub her 'the most powerful regulator of big tech on the planet.' In December 2019, she added the role of 'Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age' to her antitrust portfolio. Vestager'senhanced powers have made her a key player in the EU's ambitions to create tech companiesthat can compete globally by emphasizing the bloc's unique strengths. 'China has the data, the US has the money, and we have the purpose', she said, adding that the EU should retain its'willingness to protect the fundamental values' that had 'made us one of the most attractive places to live on the planet ever.'You're here because you want to learn more about artificial intelligence.

Tech companies have become larger, with three - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> - being valued at over USD1trn during the decade. But they have managed to do so without launching an iconic product, unlike the previous decade, when the iPhone was first introduced in 2007. It, and other smartphones, obviously got enormous scale during the decade, but no other products gained that type of volume. Smart speakers are perhaps the closest, but in our view, they perfectly highlight the key tech trend of the decade, where the focus has shifted from product to service; it is Alexa, the service, which has become the common name, and not the Echo. Tech companies have been the best at attracting and competing, often with each other, for subscribers, as the business model moves to creating a recurrent revenue stream through monthly subscriptions and bundling. This trend will continue in the current decade.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"280\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> The Decade Of Big Tech </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Market Cap (USDtrn), January 9 2020</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2075PmoCxAA25J170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Nasdaq </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>The emergence of cloud computing, in our view the most important single technology of the decade, has also driven the trend towards services. Both Amazon and Microsoft have benefitted through their very high valuations, but also the entire ecosystem with the possibility to acquire computing power as a service, at a low price, without having to build an onerous physical infrastructure. Streaming provides are a clear example of this. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> has been one of the companies of the decade, taking advantage of the development of fixed and mobile broadband services worldwide. But it also took the early decision not to build expensive infrastructure and rely on the cloud, through a long-term deal with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This allowed Netflix to invest in content first, gaining a first-mover advantage in a market with increasing competition. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020s: Three Trends</emphasis> We want to highlight three key tech trends of the 2020s: Regulation Regionalisation Automation Regulation is not a new trend, but will see further impetus during the decade as tech companies have got bigger over the last ten years. And their ambition to enter new industries, ranging from financial services, cars, home products, and even healthcare, will see greater scrutiny put upon them by a range of countries and policymakers; the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)'s investigation into Amazon's stake in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deliveroo</emphasis> is an early example. We also expect regulation to be more targeted, as recent investigations into digital advertising in Australia and the UK have shown. But more importantly, regulation will need to move beyond writing the actual rules and towards the enforcement stage in the 2020s to ensure its long-term effectiveness.Regionalisation is somewhat related to regulation. Because tech is global, but regulation national (the EU being an exception), the first rules passed can often become the global standard. This happened with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for privacy, with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) having a similar effect in a federal country like the US. Who drives the global standards for tech will be a key question for the decade, with the US starting to use trade deals in order to favour and protect its domestic companies in other markets. The US is also looking to push a light-touch approach globally, through its AI and driverless cars guidelines.But regionalisation also means the growing realisation by many nations of the importance of tech when it comes to sovereignty and geopolitics. The US and China will be the two main protagonists, both looking to convince other countries to follow their lead, but we believe we could see even greater fragmentation including the EU and perhaps even India. This decoupling will go beyond tech, but we believe tech is the industry with the most to lose, because it is the most interconnected and interdependent, and this has been a key driver of its success not only over the last decade but over the last 30 years. Any disruption to that global supply chain would have a major impact.Automation will be the most important trend of the next ten years. And it is a trend whose overall impact could be missed due to a lack of focus. With the exception of Andrew Yang, this is not something US presidential candidates have discussed at length, and it also did not feature heavily during the December 2019 UK General Election. Even in France this has barely been discussed during pension reforms, and this is an issue that policymakers worldwide will need to consider sooner rather than later, because: The Fourth Industrial Revolution is happening; It is essential to accept that change; Every company will eventually become a tech company. And discussing automation means discussing the future, not the end of work. Historically, there has always been tension relating to the introduction of new technology, over its potential adverse impact on jobs and workers; the Luddites are an early example. But more recently, in 1964, under the auspice of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution, a number of intellectuals believed that the first of these revolutions, the cybernation revolution, would see machines create a system of unlimited productive capacity which would make the human workforce virtually redundant. These fears made their way to the top, with President Lyndon Johnson signing into law a National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress, whose aim was to plan for such an eventuality.We can see now there is no direct link between the level of robotisation and the level of unemployment in a specific country, but it is likely that more tasks will be automated, meaning a change of the type of skills required for many workers. A multitude of these jobs are available, with a press report last year highlighting that over 18,000 jobs were on offer, without takers, in the East of France near the Swiss border. Education, retraining, continuous learning will be required for the work of the future, and this is what policymakers should be discussing now, to ensure automation is a positive trend for the decade, and that AI stands for augmented and not artificial intelligence. Augmentation, as opposed to replacement, is one way in which humans can still retain control over new technologies as machines will not be able to replicate many human capabilities, even in the long-term, and humans should accept to work with them, instead of fearing replacement.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> No Real Link Between Robotisation And Unemployment </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Manufacturing Robot Density Per 10,000 Employees And Unemployment Rate (%), 2018</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2024Ii9gMiZRha289\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: IFR, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'From Product To Service: A Perspective From Telecoms', April 4 2016</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'GDPR: Key Points And Impact On Industries', January 6 2017</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'GDPR: Consistent Enforcement Key To Strong Regulation', May 24 2018</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Apple Hits USD1trn.

But when the new offices, apartments and stores go up on the 36-acre Halley Rise development in Northern Virginia and a Metro station opens nearby, the company that operates them hopes the vehicles will speed people on the first or last mile of their daily commute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, a partnership between Boston-based start-up Optimus Ride and real estate developer Brookfield Properties, is a glimpse of one version of a self-driving future that features squadrons of robotic vehicles that are smaller and slower than traditional cars and that can cart people efficiently over small distances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Operating at low speeds - typically under 25 mph - in the confines of a private development is a way of sidestepping some of the technical and legal barriers that apply on the open road. And for a start-up such as Optimus, it offers the chance to compete with big tech firms and automakers. The company says it has completed some 15,000 rides in Reston since launching a few weeks ago.</p><p>\"If you do it here you can validate business models, you can validate the technology,\" said Ryan Chin, Optimus Ride's chief executive and one of its founders. \"You can introduce it in a very safe way. You can get paying customers.\"</p><p>Interest in low-speed autonomous vehicles has exploded in the past year, especially after a self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a woman last year in Arizona, dampening enthusiasm around autonomous cars. </p><p>Kelley Coyner, the author of a forthcoming study, said she is aware of about 225\u00a0projects or proposals in the United States and a couple dozen more in Canada. </p><p>Optimus, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, launched a shuttle service in Brooklyn over the summer and has at least one major direct competitor.</p><p>Traveling under 25\u00a0mph means there is less risk of killing someone if a pedestrian is hit, and the vehicle requires less-sophisticated sensors because stopping distances are shorter, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. But even for slow-speed vehicles, there are still significant technical hurdles to overcome.</p><p>Huei Peng director of Mcity, an autonomous-vehicle-research center at the University of Michigan, said the technology is advancing, but even low-speed self-driving cars have severe limitations. He compared them to the Wright brothers' early airplanes.</p><p>\"They flew a very short distance: not very high, not very far, not very fast,\" Peng said. \"They were not very exciting. They were not very useful.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious challenge: getting the vehicles to be truly driverless. Optimus uses modified six-seat electric buggies manufactured by Polaris, but two of the seats are occupied by a safety driver and an engineer.</p><p>Chin is confident that his company has solved the fundamental problem of automated driving and said that deploying the vehicles in the real world with crew on board is an important step toward going fully driverless, providing the chance to collect more data. He said the company's goal is to switch from onboard crew to a remote operator managing a squadron of vehicles at one of its sites by next year.</p><p>Seemingly simple problems must be thought through: The shuttles in Reston don't have sensors to alert them if someone opens the door while the vehicles are in motion. How should a vehicle handle a parent loading a child into a stroller? And will vulnerable people feel safe riding alone with strangers?</p><p>Andy Alden, a researcher at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, said the autonomous-vehicle industry was beset by \"excessive optimism\" as the navigation technology got better, only to be confronted by the people who use the vehicles or share the roads with them.</p><p>\"There's so many real-life issues,\" he said.</p><p>So, for now, the crew remain on the Optimus shuttles. In Reston on Monday, John Sgueglia sat behind the steering wheel of one of the vehicles, just in case. Engineer Ruijie He sat next to him, a laptop open with its screen showing the world as the shuttle saw it - blobs representing the trucks and people its cameras and lidar sensor could see - as it completed a circuit from parking lot to office building.</p><p>At times, the ride was smooth and it was difficult to tell that no human was in control. The shuttle deftly swerved between a pedestrian and an oncoming vehicle. Other times, the vehicle's robotic brain appeared confused, lingering at an all-way stop and juddering when a group of pedestrians crossed in front.</p><p>From the front seat, He said some of that unusual behavior is purposeful. Inching forward sends a signal regarding where the vehicle is aiming to go, and behaving conservatively at stop signs helps protect against drivers who are in a rush.</p><p>Engineers working on self-driving cars have come to realize that there is a bewildering array of situations they need to be able to accommodate on the road. Human brains are pretty good at adapting to novel situations; robots, not so much.</p><p>Chin said driving in a parking lot can be quite challenging - demonstrated in recent online videos of electric Teslas struggling with a new feature that allows their owners to summon them from parking spaces. Humans on foot pose another problem.</p><p>\"We've learned that pedestrian behavior is somewhat erratic, so we want to keep a safe distance,\" He said.</p><p>Chin said the company has had \"zero incidents.\" (A minor bump reported by the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper happened while one of Optimus's vehicles was being driven manually, the company says.)</p><p>For all the questions yet to be resolved, Chin is keen to point out that today the company has a commercial service with paying customers. He declined to discuss the finances of his arrangement with Brookfield, saying only that it was a two-year agreement to provide three shuttles at the Reston site.</p><p>For Brookfield, a major real estate company with dozens of similar projects, there are two major attractions to working with Optimus: the potential its vehicles could provide developments with less space devoted to money-losing parking and a buzz of excitement from prospective tenants.</p><p>\"They're really intrigued,\" said Greg Meyer, head of Brookfield's Washington region. \"I think most people recognize it's the future.\"</p><p>Academic experts and industry analysts say they expect low-speed autonomous vehicles to be more than novelties or stopgaps on the way to full-speed cars and will create new ways of getting around. They envision fleets connecting to bus and rail lines in big cities, where speeds on the road tend to be low anyway, and others designed to help the elderly and people with disabilities.</p><p>Coyner, the researcher, recently completed a study of low-speed vehicles for the Transportation Research Board, part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. When she proposed the project in June 2018, Coyner said there were about a dozen projects underway, but by the time she wrapped up a few weeks ago, there were more like 225.</p><p>\"Low speed is much more ready,\" she said. \"The interest in this exceeds what can be provided.\"</p><p>In the Washington area, a company that makes a 3-D-printed shuttle has a facility at National Harbor and ran a pilot this summer at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.</p><p>Early projects were simple tests, said Coyner, who works on mobility at the design firm Stantec, but routes are getting longer - one proposal in Hono\u00adlulu would feature an 11-mile round trip - and operators are exploring more useful deployments that could complement existing transit.</p><p>For major deployments on city streets, significant questions remain. Low-speed vehicles are not subject to the same safety standards as cars, potentially leaving them vulnerable in mixed traffic. And across the country, there is a patchwork of rules for autonomous vehicles, with federal regulators showing few signs of stepping in.</p><p>Chin recognizes the scale of the challenges and said the solution is to start with projects like the one in Reston.</p><p>\"The real world here is pretty hard,\" he said. \"The real world out there is even harder, and the real world in Times Square is supremely difficult.\"</p><p>\"Our view is, we can't do all of them,\" he said. \"Let's start with places we can get autonomous vehicles to work reasonably in the near term.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ian.duncan@washpost.com\">ian.duncan@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-4cf6818eed3311e99c6d436a0df4f31d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-BKK1-DXKP-J045-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1420\"/><timeReceived>9:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00029GX</classCode><className>BROOKFIELD OFFICE PROPERTIES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531312 NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MANAGERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS531120 LESSORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (EXCEPT MINIWAREHOUSES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS237210 LAND SUBDIVISION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Parking Facilities</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

CEO Riccardo Biasini knew it was time for a change, and wanted to consider all of the company's options.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The startup, which builds advanced driver assistance systems that can be retrofitted to several popular car brands, announced in March that it had moved its headquarters to San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For the stage we are at, it made sense to consider, maybe Silicon Valley is not the best place to keep going,\" Biasini said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He only had one concern - moving might have been the best decision for the company, but would all 12 of its employees be on board?</p><p>\"It turns out that everybody was very happy to move,\" Biasini said.</p><p>Comma.ai is one of a growing number of companies in San Diego working to piece together the puzzle of autonomous driving.</p><p>TuSimple, a startup in UTC working to develop software for autonomous trucks, recently closed a $95 million round led by Chinese media company Sina. Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Xiao-di Hou decided to launch the company in San Diego, where it currently has 140 employees, after graduating from the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>\"We chose San Diego for several reasons. Top on the list is that being outside of Silicon Valley enables the head-down approach needed to develop the technology required for autonomous trucks,\" Hou wrote in an email. \"San Diego's great natural environment helps us to attract talent.\"</p><p>Local telematics companies Smart Drive and Lytx have also seen substantial growth in recent years. The latter was acquired by private equity firm GTCR last year for $500 million.</p><p>Henrik Christensen, director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering, said the area has a few key ingredients for success: a lower cost of living, regulatory support and lots of engineering talent.</p><p>\"We have the human capital, but we need to have enough industry here that we don't put them on the first flight to Silicon Valley,\" Christensen said. \"I would like to build a robot valley. How can we in San Diego build an ecosystem that is the parallel to Silicon Valley in San Francisco, but more focused on embedded systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles?\"</p><p>For Biasini, the lower cost of living was the main reason that he, and the rest of his team, were willing to move down the coast. He expected the move would at least halve their expenses, giving them an office with room to grow for two years.</p><p>He also said it made recruiting a bit easier. The company is currently hiring for seven engineering positions.</p><p>\"The tech scene (in San Diego) is definitely rising. If you work in a startup in San Francisco, your salary isn't the same salary that you make at big tech companies, Google and Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>Opportunities to Be Creative'</p><p>Driving down Interstate 15, you might be able to spot one of Qualcomm's self-driving cars. Fadoua Chafik, a senior staff engineer at Qualcomm, is part of a growing team at the company building out technologies that make vehicles smarter.</p><p>Since Chafik joined the company, she worked on Qualcomm's first product in infotainment, which supports the systems in cars' dashboards used for navigation, music and other tools. Now she helps define which silicon technologies Qualcomm will use for its future automotive products.</p><p>In the last three years, Chafik said, the segment has grown. Though infotainment is still a big part of Qualcomm's work, the company is also dedicating more resources to its C-V2X (connected vehicle-to-everything) technology. The company hopes C-V2X will reduce accidents in the short-term, and support autonomous driving in the long-term by allowing cars to communicate directly using cellular technology, as well as gather information from smart infrastructure, such as connected traffic lights.</p><p>\"It's really changing,\" Chafik said. \"It's exciting because it's also a business for Qualcomm that is growing, so we have a lot of opportunities to be creative.\"</p><p>Building a Testing Ground</p><p>At the other end of the equation, across San Diego County, cities are starting to build out infrastructure that can support self-driving cars. In Chula Vista, for example, the city has deployed 29 intelligent traffic signals along main thoroughfares Telegraph Canyon Road and H Street as part of a strategic action plan the city adopted in 2017. The lights can adjust their duration based on traffic patterns, and will be able to \"talk\" to vehicles equipped with new technologies to warn them of an approaching red light.</p><p>\"When you talk about smart cities, it can't happen in a vacuum,\" said Dennis Gakunga, chief sustainability officer for the city of Chula Vista. \"This technology is a prerequisite to the vehicle-to-infrastructure technology of the future.\"</p><p>But the technology isn't limited to the roads. At UC San Diego, a team of 15 students is also programming two mail delivery carts.

CEO Riccardo Biasini knew it was time for a change, and wanted to consider all of the company's options.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The startup, which builds advanced driver assistance systems that can be retrofitted to several popular car brands, announced in March that it had moved its headquarters to San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For the stage we are at, it made sense to consider, maybe Silicon Valley is not the best place to keep going,\" Biasini said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He only had one concern - moving might have been the best decision for the company, but would all 12 of its employees be on board?</p><p>\"It turns out that everybody was very happy to move,\" Biasini said.</p><p>Comma.ai is one of a growing number of companies in San Diego working to piece together the puzzle of autonomous driving.</p><p>TuSimple, a startup in UTC working to develop software for autonomous trucks, recently closed a $95 million round led by Chinese media company Sina. Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Xiao-di Hou decided to launch the company in San Diego, where it currently has 140 employees, after graduating from the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>\"We chose San Diego for several reasons. Top on the list is that being outside of Silicon Valley enables the head-down approach needed to develop the technology required for autonomous trucks,\" Hou wrote in an email. \"San Diego's great natural environment helps us to attract talent.\"</p><p>Local telematics companies Smart Drive and Lytx have also seen substantial growth in recent years. The latter was acquired by private equity firm GTCR last year for $500 million.</p><p>Henrik Christensen, director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering, said the area has a few key ingredients for success: a lower cost of living, regulatory support and lots of engineering talent.</p><p>\"We have the human capital, but we need to have enough industry here that we don't put them on the first flight to Silicon Valley,\" Christensen said. \"I would like to build a robot valley. How can we in San Diego build an ecosystem that is the parallel to Silicon Valley in San Francisco, but more focused on embedded systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles?\"</p><p>For Biasini, the lower cost of living was the main reason that he, and the rest of his team, were willing to move down the coast. He expected the move would at least halve their expenses, giving them an office with room to grow for two years.</p><p>He also said it made recruiting a bit easier. The company is currently hiring for seven engineering positions.</p><p>\"The tech scene (in San Diego) is definitely rising. If you work in a startup in San Francisco, your salary isn't the same salary that you make at big tech companies, Google and Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>Opportunities to Be Creative'</p><p>Driving down Interstate 15, you might be able to spot one of Qualcomm's self-driving cars. Fadoua Chafik, a senior staff engineer at Qualcomm, is part of a growing team at the company building out technologies that make vehicles smarter.</p><p>Since Chafik joined the company, she worked on Qualcomm's first product in infotainment, which supports the systems in cars' dashboards used for navigation, music and other tools. Now she helps define which silicon technologies Qualcomm will use for its future automotive products.</p><p>In the last three years, Chafik said, the segment has grown. Though infotainment is still a big part of Qualcomm's work, the company is also dedicating more resources to its C-V2X (connected vehicle-to-everything) technology. The company hopes C-V2X will reduce accidents in the short-term, and support autonomous driving in the long-term by allowing cars to communicate directly using cellular technology, as well as gather information from smart infrastructure, such as connected traffic lights.</p><p>\"It's really changing,\" Chafik said. \"It's exciting because it's also a business for Qualcomm that is growing, so we have a lot of opportunities to be creative.\"</p><p>Building a Testing Ground</p><p>At the other end of the equation, across San Diego County, cities are starting to build out infrastructure that can support self-driving cars. In Chula Vista, for example, the city has deployed 29 intelligent traffic signals along main thoroughfares Telegraph Canyon Road and H Street as part of a strategic action plan the city adopted in 2017. The lights can adjust their duration based on traffic patterns, and will be able to \"talk\" to vehicles equipped with new technologies to warn them of an approaching red light.</p><p>\"When you talk about smart cities, it can't happen in a vacuum,\" said Dennis Gakunga, chief sustainability officer for the city of Chula Vista. \"This technology is a prerequisite to the vehicle-to-infrastructure technology of the future.\"</p><p>But the technology isn't limited to the roads. At UC San Diego, a team of 15 students is also programming two mail delivery carts. Some of them are working on intersection logic, while another group is training the system to recognize and avoid pedestrians on UCSD's busy campus.</p><p>The \"smart carts\" are tested almost every day, with a human driver at the ready, of course.</p><p>\"It's not very reliable, but we're getting there,\" Christensen said. \"We're testing (this tech) at UCSD because UCSD in many cases is the size of a small city. We have 65,000 people coming in every day.\"</p><p>Later on, Christensen hopes the carts won't just be delivering mail.

Beyond some shaky public speaking and awkward Q&amp;A sessions, the ideas dealt with at the conference were as varied and futuristic as any episode of \"Black Mirror.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The three days were led by policy and STEM researchers, government officials, lawyers and big tech corporate actors - a mix that, in abstract, sounds as tranquil as a cocktail of chamomile and Zzzquil. But the talks were anything but boring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first day kicked off with a keynote speech by Larry Downes, a tech industry analyst and best-selling author of books with such unusually forceful names as \"Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance\" and \"Big Bang Disruption: Strategy in the Age of Devastating Innovation.\"</p><p>His talk, entitled \"Eight Simple Rules for Regulating My Disruptive Innovation\" began the theme that was to run through the whole conference: how to regulate, from the perspective of the government, technologies that could spark fast, unpredictable social and economic change. Under that umbrella were such nightmare fodder as: guns that don't need people to fire them, blatantly racist algorithms and genetically modified mosquitoes.</p><p>Believe it or not, that last item is actually good news, which brings to light an important point: some of the technologies discussed were actually mostly positive but will require adequate governance to maximize their benefits.</p><p>Not all the lectures were about regulating technologies that, by their nature, would probably tend toward the destruction of humankind. But most of the lectures were, and in our sci-fi culture, the public seems to worry most about rogue artificial intelligence and murderous toaster-ovens, evidenced by our fascination with shows and films about the dark side of technological advancement. So without further introduction, here are some spooky and interesting highlights from the GETS Conference.</p><p>Larry Downes and the inglorious death of MySpace</p><p>Downes's keynote speech on the first day of the conference revolved around eight rules for regulating new technologies. There were well-designed pastel slides and lots of quotes from famous thinkers through history on the evolution of technology. But what stuck out the most was a quote about MySpace.</p><p>Victor Keegan, writing in The Guardian in 2007, penned a now-infamous headline: \"Will MySpace ever lose its monopoly?\" At the time, the question seemed a valid one, and concerns over MySpace's market dominance over the social media industry were leading some to cast their thoughts toward new anti-trust laws that could keep up with what was then an emerging set of technologies: social media platforms.</p><p>It seems a silly thought to most now, as the realm of social media today is a competition among many different companies that service many different niche markets. Downes's talk addressed this phenomenon. One of Downes's rules is that policy-makers shouldn't jump to make new laws for technologies before the market has even had a chance to sort itself out naturally. Just a few years after Keegan's Guardian article, many different social media platforms came to the fore, and MySpace took a legendary dive into obscurity.</p><p>As a parting word at the end of his talk, Downes provides the following caution in good humor: \"If you're thinking about regulating the tech giants, always remember the question: 'Will MySpace ever lose its monopoly?'\"</p><p>Carlos Ignacio Gutierrez and the invisible smart guns</p><p>Carlos Ignacio Gutierrez is a doctoral fellow at the Pardee RAND Graduate School. RAND, as in RAND Corporation, the nonprofit think tank that does all sorts of military-relevant research. Gutierrez studies the policy problems of artificial intelligence, and he presented some of his ongoing research at the GETS Conference.</p><p>The thrust of his research is to understand how AI policy has been researched in the past. It's interesting stuff and definitely worth a read, but he brought up one aspect of AI that not many people realize: no one knows if autonomous weapons exist.</p><p>That is not to say no one knows if an autonomous weapon has been built yet because it is hiding in a bunker somewhere two miles underneath the Siberian ice. Gutierrez was saying that we have weapons systems already built that may be autonomous, but no one can figure out if they actually are.</p><p>The questions of autonomy seem to revolve around whether a weapons system that picks its own target is autonomous. So if someone invented a drone that could be programmed to find at least one person stealing Milk Duds from a Circle-K, selectively target that individual, then fire a dozen missiles right on top of their unsuspecting head, we have good reasons to say such a weapon is autonomous.</p><p>But, the problem seems to be that it still needs to receive programming from a human to be able to do all those things. Autonomous? Who knows? Apparently not the U.S. military, at least.</p><p>\"It doesn't matter if (autonomous weapons systems) exist or not, because if terrorists used them, then the U.S. wouldn't want to be behind,\" Gutierrez said.</p><p>Antony Haynes and downloadable racism</p><p>The last thing you'd expect a robot to be is racist, but apparently that could be the future (or present) Americans are looking at.</p><p>Antony Haynes, associate dean at Albany Law School, presented some striking data about how certain algorithms, when programmed by a biased individual, can produce some blatantly biased outputs. One famous example is of Google's auto-tagging feature, which tagged a picture of two African-American people with the phrase \"Gorillas.\"</p><p>Now think about that imaginary drone and the milk duds thief mentioned above. How confident are you in an autonomous weapons system's version of an \"auto-tagging\" feature if Google's thinks black people are apes?</p><p>The problem of biased algorithms is more than just offensive and rude. There are real consequences as a result of these kinds of biased algorithms already.</p><p>Haynes mentioned the use of risk assessment algorithms that spit out a score indicating a criminal's likelihood of re-offending. Such risk assessment scores are used to gauge a former convict's likelihood of committing another crime in the future. The problem? These algorithms, despite their creators' best intentions, are wildly inaccurate.</p><p>Worse, they consistently rate black offenders with a higher score that is not reflective of the actual data on subsequent offenses. In other words, the algorithms predict that black people will offend much more frequently than white people, and the data shows they don't.</p><p>Read more:Machine Bias</p><p>So, racist algorithm? That may be a stretch, as first we'd have to decide if an unconscious machine has the capacity to be racist. But tools that could contribute to ongoing racism in society in a negative way? Haynes says definitely.</p><p>The consequence, according to Haynes, is a tool used in the legal system that judges people not on the basis of their character or actions.</p><p>\"The software is embedding a value that we think of as opposite to Anglo-American jurisprudence,\" Haynes said.</p><p>Reach the reporter at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:parker.shea@asu.edu\">parker.shea@asu.edu</email> or follow @laconicshamanic on Twitter.</p><p>Like The State Press on Facebook and follow @statepress on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3487027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCR-BJ31-DY7P-T4D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1230\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The State Press: Arizona State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 22, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009QZ8</classCode><className>MYSPACE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

And yes, the riots leaders as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now that a relative calm has settled upon the nation, there is in Seattle, a curious spectacle underway. Demonstrators and protesters there now are occupiers and squatters seizing part of the downtown, some six city blocks of Seattle's Capitol Hill area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Antifa and other anarchist, Black Lives Matter, and other radical left groups have gone from owning the streets for a couple of weeks to owning what they may think is permanently an Autonomous Zone.</p><p>In just a week, calls to defund the police have turned to, \"We are the police,\" at least in that Autonomous Zone in Seattle's Capitol Hill region.</p><p>It's still under the control of Antifa and other far-left groups. A border wall of sorts has been constructed around the perimeter of the zone. Anyone who isn't welcome is met by scenes like these.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>DOBBS: A stern rough crowd there. The state's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee appears clueless about what is actually going on in Seattle. Those not his words, but effectively his answer when asked.</p><p>Washington's Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, they've been silent throughout. And the city's Democratic Mayor Jenny Durkan, well, she is supporting the anarchists who have taken over part of her city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR JENNY DURKAN (D-WA), SEATTLE: Our President wants to tell a story about domestic terrorists who have a radical agenda.</p><p>It's simply not true. Lawfully gathering and expressing First Amendment rights demanding we do better as a society is not terrorism, it is patriotism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Patriotism for whom? The Mayor's comments, however, aren't nearly radical enough for one of the city's most radical City Council members, socialist, Kshama Sawant, recently led thousands of protesters right into Seattle City Hall.</p><p>Today, she took a friendly view of the armed anarchists occupying the Autonomous Zone, calling the area one of peace and dignity that should be in permanent control of the community. Sawant then call for Seattle's Mayor, well, just resign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KSHAMA SAWANT, SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: We have to hold the establishment in various cities accountable. This violence against a peaceful protest movement on Capitol Hill was carried out by Mayor Jenny Durkan, and that's why it's no surprise that tens of thousands of people in Seattle are calling for her resignation.</p><p>I can tell you, the only thing that went awry day after day after day since the first protest on May 30th was the police under orders by the Democratic Party establishment and Mayor Durkan, it was the police making going awry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Did you see how interested and thrilled the CNN anchor was with her comments? Well, with a radical Dems caught up in how best to bow to Antifa's demands, President Trump says he won't permit the lawlessness that now rages in part of Seattle. He plans to straighten the city out, if its leaders failed to do so.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're not going to let Seattle be occupied by anarchists, and I'm not calling them protesters.</p><p>QUESTION: Have you talked to the Mayor?</p><p>TRUMP: I'm not going to say -- no, but I got to see a performance that I've never seen. I mean, you think he was a weak person -- and Minneapolis, the woman, I don't know, has she ever done this before?</p><p>QUESTION: In Seattle?</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, it's pathetic. No, no, we're not going to let this happen in Seattle. If we have to go in, we're going to go in. The Governor is either going to do it -- let the Governor do it. He's got great National Guard troops. He can do it.</p><p>But one way or the other, it's going to get done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: From top to bottom, the Democrats, the left in this country is making it clear that they are anti-law enforcement and making no pretense otherwise.</p><p>Mayor Durkan tweeted this, quote, \"The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone is not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection. It is a peaceful expression of our community's collective grief and their desire to build a better world. Given his track record, it's not hard to believe that Trump is wrong, yet again.\" End quote.</p><p>They are pandering to radical activists is not confined to the Pacific Northwest. In San Francisco, that city's Democratic Mayor has announced city police officers will stop responding to non-criminal activities.</p><p>Police funds are being diverted from the police department toward the African American community. The City's Police Chief also says they'll stop releasing booking photos so as not to influence the bias of police officers, and of course the public.</p><p>In downtown St. Louis, the Fox Theater there posted tributes to both George Floyd and retired police Captain David Dorn who was murdered by looters.</p><p>The Fox Theater did what they thought was the right thing. They used two hashtags on their marquee, #BlackLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter.</p><p>The blue lives hashtag angered the radical leftwing mob. So, the theater had it removed and they apologized. We don't know whether they also had to kneel.</p><p>In New York today, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an Executive Order, an order demanding New York Police Department's reform or else, he'll take money and of course jobs.</p><p>And not a great recipe, it seems for reelection for Mr. Cuomo, especially when the largest police department is known as New York's finest, and by the way, law enforcement organizations and agencies are some of the largest contributors to the Democratic Party.</p><p>And a senior editor at the \"LA Times\" says the term looting is racist. The Dems would like you to now worry about scenes like this.</p><p>If you speak out and call it for what it is, looting by a violent mob, you're a racist. But the left says removing money from police departments will make all of this go away. Leaders in at least 34 cities and states across the country now, Democratic leaders we should point out, are now actively or simply considering defunding their police departments.</p><p>The left has done chaos in parts of this country with their obsession of race and identity-based politics. But that now is accompanied by their lust for power.</p><p>The Democratic Party is under threat by the radical left not just anarchists, it's a threat that poses a large threat to the Democratic Party, a radical transformation not for the country, but for the leftward canted Democrats.</p><p>And the possibility, of course that the extreme left's threat may reach every American, not pretty thoughts, not exactly the stuff of the American dream.</p><p>Well, since March, more than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't stop the US Chamber of Commerce, no, sir. They are urging President Trump to bring in more foreign workers because they say, that's a grand idea with 40 million Americans out of work.</p><p>The relentless Chamber CEO, Tom Donohue, writing to the President yesterday, saying, quote, \"It is crucial that they (referring to American businesses) have access to talent both domestically and from around the world.\" End quote.</p><p>This year, more than 37 million people are on food stamps in the United States. Just last week, another one and a half million Americans filed for unemployment benefits.</p><p>Yet, the Chamber of Commerce that is largely responsible for many of the policies that have led to the outsourcing of millions of American jobs and oh, yes, sending as much of the supply chain to Asia in particular and China, specifically, well, the Commerce Chamber remains hell bent on bringing in foreign workers and still maintains a posture of, the hell with the American worker.</p><p>RINO Republican senators and candidates falling in line with the resistant establishment. They're distancing themselves from President Trump because that worked out so well in 2018.</p><p>\"The Daily Beast\" reviewed 15 ads by Republicans in battleground states since March, 14 of those ads made no mention whatsoever of the President.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado ignored President Trump, but highlighted his work with the state's Democratic Governor, nonetheless. Senator Susan Collins ignored the President as well but promoted her work with Democratic senators Tim Kaine and Joe Manchin. That should assure a landslide for Collins.</p><p>House RINOs forfeiting their power under former Speaker Paul Ryan in 2018. They followed the same strategy of distancing themselves from the irrepressible President, and the man who is the leader of the party and who is already a historic President. Clever people these Republican establishment types.</p><p>On Wall Street, stocks finished higher. The Dow up 477 points. The S&amp;P up 39. The NASDAQ gaining 96. Volume on the big board 5.8 billion shares.</p><p>And for the week, the Dow lost five and a half percent. The S&amp;P lost five percent. The NASDAQ down more than two percent.</p><p>Crude oil $36.42 at today's settlement.</p><p>And a reminder to listen to my reports three times a day, coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Up next, a DC Appellate Court panel pushes back against the Justice Department and the attorneys for General Michael Flan and oh yes, they are not too thrilled with judge -- former Judge John Gleeson and his well, friendly brief to the court.</p><p>We'll be talking with Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton here next. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news, former Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell is calling out Big Tech's hypocrisy.</p><p>Microsoft announcing yesterday, quote, \"It will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law grounded in human rights.\" Can you believe that Microsoft arrogance?</p><p>Well, Grenell obviously was annoyed as well. He tweeted this in response, quote, \"Journalists should ask Microsoft and Brad Smith about their technology sales to countries that throw gays and lesbians off buildings since they are so concerned about human rights in the United States.\"</p><p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, promising yesterday yet again to hold on Obamagate criminals accountable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't believe McCabe and Comey could have possibly not known that the dossier had been rejected by the sub source. I can't believe the F.B.I. is that poorly run.</p><p>I'm not going to let four people who interviewed the sub source for three months get blamed for this. It's not fair to blame it on the underlings, if in fact, the painful at the top knew. If you care about the rule of law, you should want me to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: So, does that mean Graham is going after Obama? Clinton? What's going on? He's had some sort of amazing epiphany.</p><p>We've waited for years for Graham to get to the bottom of Obamagate. He's been a free thinker and talker throughout, landing often on several different sides of every single issue.</p><p>He's held only one hearing, though -- one hearing -- and he has been promising to get to the bottom of Obamagate for almost a year and a half. That hearing featuring former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. During that time, one hearing.</p><p>General Michael Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell telling a Federal Appellate Court today, the criminal case against General Flynn must in the Department of Justice calling for the judge to dismiss the case after all of the evidence that the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. worked overtime, trying to frame General Flynn.</p><p>Powell says Judge Emmet Sullivan and his shadow prosecutor that he brought in, retired Judge John Gleeson has no authority to do anything further, in this case, arguing, quote, \"The Department of Justice is the only entity that has the authority to prosecute this case. The government has quit. It's time to leave the field.\"</p><p>One of judges question Gleeson arguing on behalf of, well -- arguing on behalf what it means to have an adversary in which the government and the defendant agree. There was an apparently a very good answer to the issue.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch. Tom, that's kind of spectacular moment where the three judges are basically going after Sidney Powell, basically saying to her, how can you possibly want to defend General Flynn? Wouldn't it be easier if you just kind of went along with all of us in the Judiciary and just let the Justice Department frame this man?</p><p>Were you stunned by their demeanor and the tone of their questions?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: You know, we were in court last week, Lou, trying to protect the lower court's ruling that Hillary Clinton testify and we got a lot of pushback from the judges trying to, you know, second guess Judge Lamberth's decision to try to enforce the law in his court.</p><p>Now, you have General Flynn victimized here, and I hear a panel basically having zero interest in protecting General Flynn. And, you know, I'll tell you, you kind of get the whiff of politics here, and if General Flynn is to succeed.</p><p>It will probably be because the Executive Branch, they're more concerned about the separation of powers issues that the administration has raised with the judge, overtaking or usurping the power of the Executive Branch to prosecute anyone, as opposed to protecting the defendant rights of General Flynn who is currently now facing having to respond to this terrible brief that was filed by this anti-Trump retired judge, Judge Gleeson to help Judge Sullivan figure out whether to continue to harass the poor General.</p><p>It's really crazy. And I don't see based on what I heard today unless they change, you know, unless they kind of buy into the Trump administration's arguments.</p><p>By the way, Lou, the Justice Department didn't file a writ of mandamus. General Flynn had to do the heavy lifting. They came along for the ride after the fact, and the court called them on that. Unreliable. Unreliable.</p><p>DOBBS: This Department of Justice is an enigma and many mysteries and a lot of secrets covered up. It is getting to be a little unsettling, to me, at least, to think that this Department of Justice is not doing the right thing here.</p><p>You're talking about checks and balances. We're talking about co-equal branches of government. We can talk to, I think the quaint phrase is, as the cows come home, but the reality is this is about a Justice Department and an F.B.I. so damn corrupt they went out and framed a General -- a former General of the United States Army, and they did so with impunity and with absolutely -- with absolutely no fear of consequence.</p><p>And by God, listening to this Appellate Court today, watching slow walk of the Justice Department and their obvious efforts to run out the clock after all it's only four years after the incident, it's sickening to watch because that's what's at work here.</p><p>FITTON: You know, when you see Lindsey Graham talk about the salacious and unverified dossier, we've known, Comey has known about that for years. They all knew it was a fake.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham is finally asking for, quote, \"accountability,\" because I suspect Senator Graham recognizes that the Justice Department isn't going to do anything.</p><p>This is what this is about this is about. The Justice Department isn't going to hold these top officials accountable to the rule of law, and if I were the President, I'd appoint a Special Counsel, authorize them to use the U.S. Marshals or a separate law enforcement agency, the F.B.I., they can't trust to investigate itself, nor can the Justice Department properly investigate itself.</p><p>We're seeing the results today in court. General Flynn, he would be in jail even under this Justice Department if Sidney Powell hadn't blown the whistle for him.</p><p>DOBBS: I wonder if we're going to hear in his hearing anything further about who gave that that dossier at least one of the people that his good friend, the late John McCain, what was his role in this? What did he think of that dossier? And perhaps he had some proximity to that given their association and friendship.</p><p>I mean, you know, the questions here pile up. They pile up in a hurry. And I wonder just exactly whose motivation will prevail here, that of the Attorney General, strong driving the American way and desire for justice now or the old Justice Department that felt like it could go after, it could spy on a President. It could frame a General, a National Security Adviser, again, with impunity.</p><p>Because you know what? Right now, all of the bull aside, we have seen zero accountability for trying to overthrow a President of the United States.</p><p>It is sickening to watch, and it is just as sickening to watch the national leftwing media blind themselves to all that occurred to See No Evil To Hear No Evil.</p><p>FITTON: Look, I mean, just last week we had an insurrection in Washington, D.C. that the President had to suppress and they were trying to destroy the city, Lou, and what is the reaction of the establishment class in this town this week?</p><p>Let's undermine the police with absurd regulations and let's undermine the thin blue line that protects us from the anarchical forces out there.</p><p>I mean, we have Antifa staying out there in Seattle, the Justice Department, I don't know what they're doing. Who is vindicating the Civil Rights of the American citizens being held hostage within those few blocks? The other city residents being forced to deal with this hostile organization organizing within its city limits. Incredible.</p><p>The President is all alone --</p><p>DOBBS: It's also --</p><p>FITTON: Go ahead, sorry.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, he's all alone, except for those who vote for him, who support him and understand. This is about the life and the death of a Constitutional Republic. That's how important this election is. And it is not one whit less important than that, as Tom Fitton, well knows.</p><p>Judicial Watch President, good to have you with us. Thanks so much, Tom.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments. Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. Like me on Facebook. Follow me on Instagram @#LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>A programming note, historian Victor Davis Hanson among our guests here Monday. We hope you will join us for that, and thank you for being with us here this evening.</p><p>Up next, Twitter removing accounts that were intended to spread Chinese propaganda about the China virus and the Hong Kong takeover.</p><p>We'll take that up in more. Gordon Chang joins me when we continue Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight, Gordon Chang. He is a columnist, author, Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute. And Gordon, good to have you with us.</p><p>Let's start with the threat from a Chinese official saying that the United States will face a fight, if indeed, we choose to decouple from China. This is on its face outrageous. Your reaction?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: Well, China used to say that it was impossible to decouple. And now they're actually waging a frantic campaign against it because they know it's not only possible, but it's also inevitable.</p><p>Last year Lou, China's merchandise trade surplus with the United States was at 81.8 percent of its overall merchandise surplus, which shows you how important the United States is. And China right now has an economy that is continuing to contract. They really need the United States because their exports are declining. They need American consumers to save the economy of China.</p><p>DOBBS: What do you say to those who argue that the United States needs China more than they need us? That is -- look at our dependency on the supply chains. Look at Apple, it has the guts of its business, much of it in China. It has got about half a million employees in China.</p><p>It's really difficult to see how quickly we can decouple even though I happen to be among those who think we definitely should.</p><p>CHANG: Well, Apple is the company that is the most dependent on China, and we have one industry, pharmaceuticals that is dependent on China.</p><p>But apart from that, we can decouple very fast and in fact, we have been decoupling very fast, almost across the board, Lou. So, this is a process which began before President Trump, certainly accelerated under President Trump, and it's not just a question of the tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which are the remedy for the theft of U.S. intellectual property, it's also been the coronavirus.</p><p>DOBBS: Did I misunderstand you? Did I misunderstand you? Did you say the decoupling as you called it started before President Trump?</p><p>CHANG: It started before because Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler was enacting all sorts of anti-foreign company legislation and rules. And so there was a slow start, but it's certainly accelerated under President Trump.</p><p>And it was not only because of the tariffs, but it was also because of the coronavirus. And also there are other policies of the administration that encouraged American companies to leave.</p><p>And this is a trend that is going to accelerate, largely because we have heard --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I have to say you and I have a different view of history. Because frankly, I didn't see any decoupling whatsoever. And, and there was in point of fact, if you look to the CEOs of Wall Street today, you see nothing but avarice and lust for profit in their faces and in their eyes because they are going into China in a very big way, the richest, if not the richest, the largest market imaginable on the planet right now, outside of India and Europe.</p><p>I mean, this is -- this is a moment in history in which this President has to decide how to go forward. More than a hundred thousand Americans murdered in point of fact, by the Chinese who refused to warn the world that they had unleashed a deadly contagion. That's a straightforward act of murder.</p><p>CHANG: It is, Lou because --</p><p>DOBBS: How does he balance all of these interests?</p><p>CHANG: Well, the problem here is that we know that Chinese communism is unreformable, so the only way we can protect ourselves is to reduce our exposure to it. And you're absolutely right.</p><p>Lou, it was even worse than refusing to warn, China during a five-week period or maybe even longer knew that this disease was human to human transmissible, but Chinese leaders tried to tell the world it was not so contagious, and that means that this was an act, as you say, of murder, because at the same time, the Chinese leaders were pressuring countries to accept arrivals from China.</p><p>There's no other conclusion that fits the facts. This was malicious. This was an act of mass murder, because we're talking about what? Three hundred thousand to four hundred thousand people killed around the world, and that includes 116,000 Americans as of today.</p><p>DOBBS: Gordon Chang, good to see you. Thanks for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>Up next, how the Democratic Party is exploiting the Black Lives Matter movement. Bishop Harry Jackson joins me with that and much more right after these quick messages. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The Black Lives Matter Movement is just another arm of the Democratic Party in the minds of some. The donation page at blacklivesmatter.com uses fundraising software from ActBlue Charities, which is part of the PAC ActBlue.</p><p>The top recipients of money by the way from ActBlue are a number of Democratic presidential campaigns including that of Joe Biden, of course, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the D.N.C. all have received money from ActBlue.</p><p>Joe Biden making a curious comparison yesterday to the unrest after George Floyd's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Even Dr. King's assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd's death did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Wow. Our next guest was with President Trump yesterday in Dallas for a roundtable, for a discussion about the civil unrest.</p><p>Joining us tonight is -- I am pleased to say -- Bishop Harry Jackson, he is senior Pastor at the Hope Christian Church in Maryland. We've been down a few roads together, author of \"A Manifesto: Christian America's Contract with Minorities.\" It's great to have you, Harry here and to be able to talk with you. It's good to see.</p><p>BISHOP HARRY JACKSON, SENIOR PASTOR, HOPE CHRISTIAN CHURCH - MARYLAND: Yes, it's good to see you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: So, let me start with the President -- thank you, sir. We've got something going on here. That is very difficult to really understand. We've got a lot of viewpoints. We've got a lot of collision.</p><p>But what we are witnessing now, just for example, in Seattle is the Black Lives Matter is complaining because the anarchists have taken over their messaging, your reaction to what we witnessed, what we've experienced and where we are now.</p><p>JACKSON: Well, I believe this is time for courage and leadership. And I believe the President has both of those. But one of the challenges is that this crisis is trying to be exploited by the Democratic Party, when they knelt down at the back Capitol Building wearing Kente cloth. That was a bridge too far.</p><p>It was almost as though they were saying, we believe in you, black America. The problem is that they had eight years of presidency, four years with both the House and Senate locked up and they did nothing.</p><p>Criminal Justice Reform was led by President Trump. The opportunity zones is helping right now real time in urban America to revitalize. The unemployment level of blacks. I could go on and on and on.</p><p>Trump has a minority doctrine that is for black people. But Lou, one of the problems right now is that they want to -- the Democrats want to use these assaults to alienate minorities against Trump. If they lose the black vote, Hispanic vote, they lose.</p><p>Now, there are two messages that have to come out. One and there's a tension, I want to encourage your people watching to work with me with this tension.</p><p>First tension is that African Americans need to know somebody cares about the loss of life and this goes back to Jim Crow, and the history. It's not just current America.</p><p>And then the second thing is everybody knows we've got to keep America safe. I believe African Americans are looking to hear we care. The President doing what he did in Dallas, speaking from the heart, it will help turn and comfort African Americans.</p><p>And then there needs to be a clear strategy to protect the cities, and then to reform in the places that need it what policing looks like in America.</p><p>Two separate things, can't talk about them in the same breath. Oddly, the listening tour is huge, Lou, and that the President who has a quick mind, he is decisive, actually sat and listened to a mostly black panel.</p><p>His Vice President did that in my church in D.C. the week before, and I believe it's the beginning of a time. I said this and you'll like it.</p><p>I believe that this administration, obviously, you and I have talked about race many times. They did not create this problem despite what the Democrats want to do in terms of pointing fingers.</p><p>The problem was here long ago. My father was threatened at gunpoint. He saw people hanging from trees -- all kinds of crazy things.</p><p>But we have the privilege of a courageous, strong leader. He can fix something he didn't start, and I believe that will advance the American dream.</p><p>I believe that King's dream was not Just King's ownership. I believe it was something inspired by God that even the pilgrims wanted in America, the Mayflower Compact.</p><p>Last word, the church needs to lead the way. What we're dealing with in America, it was a church that started the Abolitionist Movement and started the Republican Party. It was the church that decided that in the middle of a Civil War, that many whites who had never seen a slave lost their lives to free folks.</p><p>Civil Rights Movement, you know, the NAACP was started by a majority white group because of black lynching in the early 20th Century. So, it's always been a mixed race, primarily religious group that has led moral reform in our nation, and I believe we're got to do it again.</p><p>And I'm calling for a Prayer Movement, followed up by specifics. I told the President yesterday I'd like to lead about 50 of these roundtables where people recently saw the problem. You and I agree that love intangible is not going to solve this problem. But love with servants' clothes on can change America.</p><p>And I believe Mr. Trump is big enough, strong enough, and bold enough to take action that will change our lives.</p><p>DOBBS: Bishop Henry Jackson, you've given us, as always, a lot to think about to consider carefully. We appreciate it. I look forward to our next conversation and I don't know why you only want to lead 50 of those roundtables. I think you need to work harder, Bishop.</p><p>We appreciate it, and I hope the President gives you all of that to do.</p><p>Up next, more on the political unrest in this country. Pastor Robert Jeffress joins us in just a few moments. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us now, Pastor Robert Jeffress, member of the White House Faith Initiative, Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, Fox Business contributor and author of the new book, \"Praying for America.\" And as the saying goes, it sure couldn't hurt. Hope you'll do that and buy the Pastor's book, which we highly recommend to you. Great to have you with us.</p><p>PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I was talking with Bishop Harry Jackson earlier, I've known him for a long time. The man and -- you know, working with the President, and we're watching people who are not giving him credit in the African American community for the lowest unemployment rate in our country's history for African Americans, for other minorities, for the country.</p><p>Not giving him credit for the opportunity zones, not giving him credit for justice reform, and he is the guy who all Americans should remember.</p><p>He is the guy who said to the inner city, particularly, African Americans, specifically, what have you got to lose? Asking for their votes a chance, and he delivered. How does he get that message?</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, I think through a good spokesman like my good friend, Harry Jackson, in fact, Harry and I are on television back to back and in Washington, D.C. on Sunday mornings. He is a great Christian and a great spokesman for the faith.</p><p>And look, I think Harry would agree with this. Yes, we need to extinguish the problem of racism. President Trump doesn't have a scintilla of racism about him at all.</p><p>But the President was right yesterday and in the last several weeks in also talking about the problem of lawlessness in the Bible. And look, Lou, this -- or in the country and look Lou, this whole idea of dismantling the police that an absurd idea that leads to hurt not just in the white communities, but in African American communities and throughout America.</p><p>You know, in Romans 13, the Apostle Paul said, government authorities are established by God. There are Ministers of God to execute punishment against those who do what is evil.</p><p>And when Paul wrote those words, Rome was in control. They had executed Christ 30 years earlier. They would behead Paul, ultimately. Paul knew above all people that law enforcement doesn't always get it right, but that is no excuse for eliminating law enforcement and to do so is foolish.</p><p>I think about that Bible verse, saying to me, wise they became fools. Lou, the left is nothing but fools when they try to replace God's idea with their own foolish idea to dismantle the police.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it's -- I can't even believe what I'm hearing from these radical left groups, the Democratic Party buying into it. Nancy Pelosi looks like she is in a fever to get as far left as she possibly can. She wants to knock down some sashes herself.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: It is -- this is a moment in which we are watching irrationality. We're watching great passions, and we're watching some of the most foolish language I've ever heard in this country, and that's going some to say, and what I'm talking about in particular, are people saying, you know, turn over pieces of a city to a quote unquote, \"community.\"</p><p>A community by the way that's divided between Antifa and Black Lives Matter. They're battling each other right now, ideologically that is.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Absolutely. And Lou -- yes, and that's the whole point. I mean, once the left, if they succeed, they don't only want to dismantle our current police, they want to replace our current police with the thought police who go around patrolling every thought that they find objectionable.</p><p>And if the left ever gains control of this country again, I predict it's going to be like the French Revolution. It's going to be bring out the guillotines and execute every thought they object to and every person who holds every thought that they object to.</p><p>That is why what happens in November is so crucial. The future of our nation is at stake here.</p><p>DOBBS: It is indeed, and that's why so much also concurrently, we need to rid ourselves of the political corruption that is reaching through our government now.</p><p>Still, and Spygate is not over until the accountability of all who waged war on this President are brought to justice. Pastor Robert Jeffers, great to see you as always. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Historian Victor Davis Hanson will be among our guests, Monday. We hope you will join us.</p><p>And a reminder to follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. Like me on Facebook and follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>A reminder to buy Bishop Harry Jackson's book, \"A Manifesto,\" and Pastor Robert Jeffress's book \"Praying for America.\"</p><p>We thank you for doing so and we thank you for being with us this evening. Have a great weekend. See you Monday. Good night from Sussex.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Following an initial decline to as low as 1924.15, the tech-charged index rebounded sharply to close just off its high, up 54.21, or 2.8%, to 2003.75. The gain is the eighth-biggest point rise in the Nasdaq's history.\u00a0</p><p>News of some bullish forecasts by high-tech companies presenting at Credit Suisse First Boston's conference in Arizona was cited as a factor in the advance. For example, Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) CEO John Chambers told CNBC in an interview from the conference he believes the company can continue to grow at more than 30% annually for the next three to five years.\u00a0</p><p>Cisco rose 5.7% while fellow tech bellwethers Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), Sun Microsystems (SUNW:Nasdaq), Intel (INTC:Nasdaq), Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) and 3Com (COMS:NYSE) each posted greater percentage gains. The large-cap Nasdaq 100 surged 4.8%. With New York Stock Exchange-traded names such as IBM (IBM:NYSE) and Micron Technology (MU:NYSE) joining the upswing, the Morgan Stanley High-Tech 35 gained 3.9%.\u00a0</p><p>Internet stocks, meanwhile, produced another day of wild swings. TheStreet.com Internet Sector closed down 8.09, or 2.3%, to 343.78, but well off its intraday low of 325.86. Bigger Net names such as Amazon.com (AMZN:Nasdaq), which closed up 9.1% at 209 1/2 after falling as low as 182, performed better than smaller players such as Open Market (OMKT:Nasdaq), which shed 10.4%.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're looking at Internet stocks as a microcosm of the overall market,\" said one market player. \"It's an exaggerated version of what's going on. It's all momentum based, but there's a lot of liquidity out there.\"\u00a0</p><p>With transportation names joining big tech on the upswing, the S&amp;P 500 overcame an early decline to 1150.31 to close up 11.65, or 1%, to 1175.28. Airlines were encouraged by another decline in crude prices, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average rise 16.61, or 0.6%, to 3047.84. The American Stock Exchange Airline Index climbed nearly 3%, with Delta Air Lines (DAL:NYSE) and Alaska Air Group (ALK:NYSE) leading the charge.\u00a0</p><p>The Russell 2000 rose 0.99, or 0.3%, to 398.74.\u00a0</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, closed up 16.99, or 0.2% , to 9133.54 after hitting an intraday low of 8987.82. At its nadir, the index was down 4.1% from it's all-time high of 9374.27 reached Nov. 23. The decline proved enough to inspire buyers. IBM was the Dow's leading gainer, followed by Caterpillar (CAT:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>Exxon (XON:NYSE) was the Dow's biggest negative influence, falling 4.3% on news of its formal merger agreement with Mobil (MOB:NYSE). The near-$80 billion merger is the biggest in U.S. corporate history but failed to inspire other oil producers amid continued weakness in crude prices. The American Stock Exchange Oil Index and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Index each lost about 2%.\u00a0</p><p>Sears (S:NYSE) was the other big drag on the Dow, falling 6.2% after Bear Stearns downgraded the retailer to attractive from buy.\u00a0</p><p>Brokerage stocks were also laggards after Merrill Lynch said the recent rally in the sector was \"premature\" and cut its rating on Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MWD:NYSE) to near-term neutral from accumulate. The Amex Broker/Dealer Index fell 2.6% to 498.55 but rose from its intraday low of 487.11.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Big Volume, Bad Breadth\u00a0</p><p>Given the early declines and weakness in overseas markets, the gains were impressive and indicate losses suffered yesterday did little to shake investors' confidence. Still, the advance was not accompanied by corresponding strength in market breadth, although trading volumes were robust.\u00a0</p><p>In NYSE trading, 789.3 million shares were exchanged, while declining stocks led advancers 1,565 to 1,505. In Nasdaq Stock Market activity, 1.032 billion shares traded while losers led 2,314 to 1,834. New 52-week highs led new lows 63 to 49 on the Big Board and while new lows led 75 to 56 in over-the-counter trading.\u00a0</p><p>The session was the seventh-biggest volume day ever on the Nasdaq and marked the first time more than 1 billion shares have traded on consecutive days. Moreover, seven of the 10 biggest volume days in the Nasdaq's history have occurred since Aug. 31.\u00a0</p><p>Yet not everyone was impressed by the market's comeback.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm still surprised people are buying dips in here,\" said Jack Ablin, managing director at Colonial Asset Management in Jacksonville, Fla. \"We got past our recent highs but the only news that has changed between the bottoming out and today is the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates. That means something, but earnings are earnings and it's still going to get back to that.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think Christmas is certainly better than what I would have expected three or four month ago, but most of the news is a lot of anecdotal stuff,\" Ablin went on. \"I'm not sure the deflation issue is all of a sudden gone with oil at [below] $11 a barrel.\"\u00a0</p><p>Ironically, nagging concerns about deflation could be a factor in the strength of big tech stocks, he said. \"Even in the event in slowdown, people still invest in technology,\" Ablin said. \"If people are looking for an opportunity to invest in companies that know how to deal well in spite of price declines, it's not a bad place to be. They've lived that\" with the rapid ascent of the sub-$1,000 PC.\u00a0</p><p>Colonial -- where the average holding has a market cap of $20 billion -- currently has long positions in tech giants such as Oracle (ORCL:NYSE), IBM, Compaq (CPQ:NYSE) and Harris (HRS:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>Ablin is \"cautious\" overall but remains fully invested. He said Colonial was putting client assets to work today so month-, quarter- and year-to-date comparisons will be easier to make. While unable to quantify how prevalent such practices are at other fund groups, Ablin said the fact today is the first of the month probably aided the advance. \"There's a certain amount of purchasing that goes on,\" he said. \"If you don't get money in at the first, month-to-date numbers can look strange. We manage for individuals who look at those things.\"\u00a0</p><p>Among other indices, the Dow Jones Utility Average gained 1.65, or 0.5%, to 305.17; and the American Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.58, or 0.1%, to 663.\u00a0</p><p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32 to 103 5/32, sending its yield down to 5.05%.\u00a0</p><p>Elsewhere in North American equities, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 bounded 113.23, or 1.8%, to 6457.10 and the Mexican Stock Exchange IPC Index lost 20.50 to 3749.38.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tuesday's Company Report\u00a0</p><p>By Heather Moore<br/>Staff Reporter\u00a0</p><p>(Earnings estimates from First Call; new highs and lows on a closing basis unless otherwise specified.

He made it interesting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it will be filing a lawsuit to block AT&amp;T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. It's just the most recent in a bizarre series of developments around what is a massively important move in the media world.</p><p> Importance, however, doesn't mean public interest. Apart from the initial announcement, these kinds of deals tend to be pretty boring. Stories about antitrust, for example, aren't exactly on most people's must-read list. But they should be, assuming you like to watch HBO, use a smartphone to do just about anything, see movies, or read the news.</p><p> Nothing less than the future of the entertainment and news industries are at stake\u2014not to mention how much these companies can charge for their services.</p><p> The AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal is a a pretty wild endeavor. Here's a bit of a rundown:</p><p> *</p><p> Trump regularly goes after CNN during his campaign.</p><p> *</p><p>AT&amp;T announces in October 2016 that it has an agreement to buy Time Warner, which owns CNN.</p><p> *</p><p> Not long after, Trump publicly calls out the deal, saying it's \"too much concentration of power.\"</p><p> *</p><p> Trump continues to attack CNN through the election, tweeting throughout his presidency with complaints about the media outlet.</p><p> *</p><p> People in the Trump administration reportedly saw Time Warner's ownership of CNN as \"a potential point of leverage\" to pressure a change in CNN's coverage.</p><p> *</p><p> Trump appointed a head of the Department of Justice's antitrust operation that said this about the deal: \"I don't see this as a major antitrust problem.\"</p><p> *</p><p> The talks between AT&amp;T and the DOJ leak, with initial reports saying that the DOJ told AT&amp;T it would need to sell CNN for the deal to go through. That led to a variety of reports that contradicted each other over what the DOJ had told AT&amp;T and what AT&amp;T told the DOJ. The only thing that seemed clear was that CNN was an important part of the talks.</p><p> By corporate merger standards, this is a grease fire on which everyone is dumping more water, especially Trump. His constant attacks on CNN will certainly make up an important point in AT&amp;T's argument that the DOJ\u2014and its antitrust regulator who publicly stated the deal looked fine\u2014should just approve the deal.</p><p> Meanwhile, the DOJ is trying to do damage control while arguably causing even more harm. During a background call with reporters, a DOJ spokesperson reportedly sniped at news outlets associated with the companies involved\u2014which was read as a veiled threat at CNN.</p><p> A specific, not-very veiled suggestion: CNN's reporting on the merger is biased. \"Some of these merging parties are in the business of providing content,\" said a DOJ official, who sounded aggrieved. \"I'm in the business of providing the facts and the law.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/2wHhUhPakI\">https://t.co/2wHhUhPakI</url></p><p> \u2014 Peter Kafka (@pkafka) November 20, 2017</p><p> This is great. Rarely do these kinds of deals get such attention or have such enjoyable storylines. But they should.</p><p> Major mergers have been receiving a minimal amount of scrutiny in recent decades, leading to a recurring cycle of consolidation that resulted in the emergence of tremendously powerful companies that keep getting bigger to stay one step ahead of each other. Trump's FCC is fueling even more mergers, undoing rules that tried to limit how much of the U.S. media ecosystem any one company could own.</p><p> Meanwhile, the media mega-corporations are competing against a relatively new foe: big tech companies. Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are all making big movies into the media world, snapping up consumer attention time, advertising dollars, and content creators. Those companies are now routinely mentioned as a reason media companies need to get bigger.</p><p> Now, all of these issues are coming to the forefront, topped off with a bit of Trump spice. It's our best chance yet at having a serious discussion about these issues around a topic that has captured at least some of the public's imagination.</p><p> The case could also trigger bigger discussions around how major tech companies should be seen as competitors to media companies. Such a discussion would represent an important consideration of the power of tech companies, which is sorely needed. The new tech titans have almost entirely avoided competitive scrutiny, and only recently have they been having to discuss their power due to Russia's attempts at swinging the 2016 election.</p><p> I think the big losers of the DOJ suing to block the @ATT deal will be @FB and @Google. Their media advertising , content and distribution dominance will be a defense at trial. That could create bigger issues for them</p><p>  \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 20, 2017</p><p> Let's give credit where credit is due: None of this happens without Donald Trump constantly attacking CNN. Now, we're set up for a pretty serious lawsuit in which antitrust regulators will have to consider the effect that big media mergers have on the industry as a whole and how big tech companies play into the market.</p><p> These are essential questions that academics, analysts, and politicians will be wrestling with for years.

will be piloting a midlife MOT next month in Norwich to judge whether there is any value in the proposition. </p><p>The idea of a midlife MOT was called for by the ABI in its report out today and this concept was also backed by Mr Opperman.</p><p>Aviva launched its project on Tuesday (24 April) and within 24 hours 50 per cent of the seats available had been taken, Mr McQueen said.</p><p>He said: \"There is a demand to get support and get service because people understand the importance of this and there is a huge price for the provider who can come into this market and do that.\"</p><p>But he acknowledged regulation was still hampering innovation and efforts to create better consumer engagement.</p><p>He said customers want simplicity and transparency and the regulator was more on the transparency side.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to deliver simple communications at the same time as delivering transparent communications because transparency brings with it caveats, footnotes,

Advantage, shared this view.</p><p>He also said innovation was not spurred by consumer demand but by regulatory change.</p><p>Mr Fazzini-Jones said: \"If we had sat in the room before (former chancellor George) Osborne announced the (pension freedom) changes we probably wouldn't have launched the [retirement account] because we wouldn't have thought the market was ready for it.\"</p><p>Before the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) the market was black and white, people either went for annuities or drawdown, he said.</p><p>But the rules that came after the pension reforms meant people could actually house an annuity inside drawdown and that gave them a lot of benefits in terms of tax planning and control, he said.</p><p>Mr Fazzini-Jones said: \"Strangely enough the advent of the reforms in a way is what drove the innovation because we had to respond to a market that didn't want to buy annuities anymore and to think more about customer needs.</p><p>\"By offering the retirement account we gave the advisers something to talk about to their customers to the effect of what they were hoping to get: have a guarantee, more flexibility, more control.\"</p><p><email

Good morning, and welcome to Avnet's 2006 Analyst Day from New York City. I am Vince Keenan, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for Avnet. As you can see on this slide, we have a very full agenda today. Over the course of the morning, we will provide an overview of Avnet's strategy and value proposition, as well and update on our financial performance and business model.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an effort to better convey the value we bring into technology supply chain, we have added a customer panel this year to both of our operating groups, Electronics Marketing and Technology Solutions. We are confident that our customers' participation will add additional insight into the vital way that Avnet plays in an increasingly complex supply chain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd just like to cover, right now, a few housekeeping items. We will Q&amp;A sessions throughout the day. And I would appreciate if you could all wait until a microphone is brought over to you. And then, you can ask a question. And also, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.</p><p>Also, as you can see, we have a full agenda and only one break at 10:15, so when we do break, I'd appreciate if everybody could get back on time, so we can stay on schedule. And again, at the end of the day, we have a boxed lunch outside. You're welcome to grab a lunch, come back in, and the executive team will be available for discussions or further questions.</p><p>Before we get started, if you are listening by webcast today and have not accessed the slides that accompany this presentation, please go to our website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ir.avnet.com\">www.ir.avnet.com</url> and click on the icon announcing this event. In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, the company also discusses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain items. Reconciliations of the company's to GAAP can be found on Avnet's website and in several of the slides in this presentation.</p><p>I would also like to quickly review Avnet's Safe Harbor statement. This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements, which are statements addressing the future financial and operating results of Avnet. Listed on this slide are several factors that could result -- that would cause those numbers to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.</p><p>With us today are <person><nameText>Roy Vallee, </nameText></person>Chairman and CEO; <person><nameText>Rick Hamada, </nameText></person>Chief Operating Officer, who is also acting President of Technology Solutions; Ray Sadowski, Chief Financial Officer; and Harley Feldberg, President of Electronics Marketing. With that, let's get our day started. And I'd like to introduce you to <person><nameText>Roy Vallee, </nameText></person>Chairman and CEO.</p><p><person><nameText>ROY VALLEE, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, CEO, AVNET: Okay. Thanks, Vince. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the time to be with us today, very excited about this opportunity and looking forward to a very productive day. So, let me just walk through what my plans are. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Avnet today, in case there's any newcomers to the story, just give a quick snapshot type of an overview; then going to talk about the industry environment and the trends that we're seeing, and in the process, talk about the opportunities that exist for Avnet to continue to grow its business on a global basis.</p><p>I think there's some particularly interesting things happening in the semiconductor cycle, if you will, and I'm going to point to those and draw some attention to them. And I do want to make a disclaimer that it is not my intent to predict the future of the semiconductor cycle, but I would like to make some observations about things that we see going on that you might find interesting. And then, I'm going to talk about Avnet's strategy from the Avnet Inc. perspective.</p><p>Rick and Harley, of course, will talk a lot more about the strategy that's being put to work inside of our business units. But, Avnet Inc. has a way of thinking about what we want to do with our company and a framework for that, so I'm going to share that with you as well.</p><p>So first of all, Avnet operates within the global technology supply chain at two different points, one where we sell electronic components, literally for the world's leading technology suppliers. And we sell those to essentially anyone who manufactures electronic equipment. And then, in the case of information technology, we pick up again with enterprise class hardware along with software and services, and we resell that, predominantly, through resellers and system builders to deliver those goods to the end users.</p><p>Over the past 50 years plus now, we've been growing our business, both organically and through M&amp;A. What we've seen -- what we show you here is that we have a business that ended with $14.25 billion in sales for fiscal year '06, ended last June, and we are increasing operating margins steadily coming off the technology bubble bursting that took place in the early part of this decade.</p><p>There's some additional verbiage here about the products and services that each one of our operating groups is involved in. If you drop down to the pie charts at the bottom, as of the end of fiscal year '06, we're giving you a flavor for how the business is composed. About two-thirds of revenues are at Electronics Marketing. As you can see, it's a higher margin business than Technology Solutions, so about 72% of our income is derived from that group.</p><p>And on the other hand, it is also the more asset-intensive business unit, so it has a disproportionate share of our assets as well. And you'll throughout the day that, we drive these businesses to the same return on capital employed, and so the lower margins requires a higher velocity at Tech Solutions.</p><p>So with that, let me just jump into a macro view of the industry that we are fortunate enough to serve. If we zoom in our Electronics Marketing operating group, we see that the market in the 2006 for electronic components, which we are a franchise for, the markets that we address, it's up over $250 billion. And over the next couple of years, it's projected to grow at an 8% or 9% compound annual growth rate.</p><p>And we'd like to draw your attention to the illegible asterisk at the bottom, which says that we exclude microprocessor and DRAMs from this TAM data. This indicates our semiconductor data does not match yours, and the reason is because we don't sell these products at Electronic Marketing for all practical purposes. We move those through Technology Solutions into the system builder marketplace.</p><p>One of the key trends, of course, in this business is the growth of Asia Pacific. So, what you can see is that from the early part of this decade, Asia-Pac has sort of pulled away, if you will, and has become by far, the largest region of the world for semiconductor consumption. So, you see the projected five-year compound annual growth rate for Asia to be in the 12% range. Notice though that, while the other three are sort of bunched together, there is positive growth projected for every region of the world for semiconductors, and we see that as an opportunity for our businesses there.</p><p>To move over to Technology Solutions, and again what we've done here is, we've taken industry data, profiled or mix adjusted to the products and services, which we are involved in as a company. And it turns out that that market in 2006 is almost $800 billion. And I do, again, want to clarify. This is the total available market on a global basis. So, this is not necessarily the DTAM or the distributor market, and it includes places like Japan, where we have relatively limited coverage today. But, this is the big picture, total available market that we have the opportunity to serve.</p><p>So, you'll notice that it's bigger than the components market, but it's compound annual growth rate over the next couple of years is projected to grow at about 6% or 7% CAGR, where the components market was growing at a faster rate.</p><p>Similarly, the Asia-Pac region is, in fact, the fastest growth region. You see it down there at 7.9%, but it is not the largest region by any stretch. Europe and America continue to represent the biggest opportunities in absolute dollar terms. I'll also point out that where in the components business, the notion of worldwide global manufacturing has driven a lot of semiconductor consumption in the Asia-Pac, there is a big difference between computers are built and where computers are used. And so, America still remains a healthy market as does Western Europe.</p><p>This is a slide that we borrowed from the Global Technology Distribution Council. They went out and commissioned an independent analyst to do a review of leading IT vendor growth rates compared to the growth of the distributors who move those products into the channels. And what you can see here is that, over the last couple of years, and we expect this to extend into this year, the distribution industry in IT is clearly outgrowing their suppliers, meaning that the DTAM, or distributor total available market, is growing at a faster rate than the TAM.</p><p>So, if you aggregate this data, the electronics marketing served market, the TS served market, do a stacked bar, what you see is that an interesting milestone has occurred here in 2006, and that is our global total market available to us has crossed over the $1 trillion mark, so that's an interesting number. And when you aggregate the growth rates and you mix or weight-adjust them, it turns out that we have a market that's growing around a 7%, possibly an 8% compound annual growth. So the message here is, we are operating in a large market that is growing at a reasonable rate.</p><p>There's another interesting trend here. So, the solid lines indicate the past, what has happened. And what we've done here is overlaid the growth of the IT business, which tends to be economically cyclical against the growth of our semiconductor industry, which tends to be volatile, driven by supply and demand imbalances that occur on a regular basis.</p><p>So, what you can see is that historically, there was a lot of volatility. If you take the industry-leading forecasters, and they are referenced there, and you could use pretty much anybody you would like, the expectations going forward are that the components industry, and more specifically semiconductors, are going to grow at a much less volatile rate, a lower overall secular growth rate, but much less volatile.</p><p>And our computer business, we expect to continue along with its economic cyclicality, but relatively stable compared to our history with semiconductors. And this could be a whole new environment for Avnet and for the industry to operate in.</p><p>So, what I'd like to do now is focus on, what are the structural changes that are occurring in the semiconductor industry and see if we can figure out why those expert forecasters, who get paid a lot of money for predicting the future, are saying that the past is not prologued. So first of all, we have an industry that has grown quite nicely since it's inception, and in fact, worldwide total semiconductors will be around $245 billion this year. That will represent a new record for global consumption of semiconductor products. That's terrific.</p><p>Something else we've done here is, we've taken the individual years, and we've looked at the growth rate. And if the rate of growth was greater than 5%, we've indicated that that's a pretty good year and given that a green light, if you will. If the year grew, but it was less than 5%, we gave that a yellow. And if the growth was negative, we gave that a red. So, what you can see is that the bulk of the years are green, but every once in a while, red and yellows pop into the equation.</p><p>So, record year for sales, but if you look at the annual growth rates and you plot them, of course the first thing you observe is that we have Coney Island roller coaster going on here. And you also see that the secular trend is for a slower and slower annual growth rate for the semiconductor industry.</p><p>However, if you zoom in on just that last five-year period, the five-year compound annual growth rate is now actually re-accelerating. And in fact, it's re-accelerating to a double-digit rate of growth. So, as we lose the '00 to '01 compare, which was a very negative year, -34% as I recall, we now over the last five years, are in a positive growth environment, and in fact interestingly enough, a double-digit growth, 12.4%.</p><p>So, what is a normal semiconductor cycle? We're all familiar with the historical volatility. We'd just like to point of things on this chart. For 20 years, roughly '77 to '97, the cycles were five years long. There were four good years and one bad year. It turns out that one cycle was four years, and one cycle was six years, but it seems pretty predictable.</p><p>And what you see there is a bunch of green bars with one red, and then a bunch of green bars with one red, and it seemed like we could all time the semiconductor market. And in fact, I think maybe a few of us have made a little money selling on the change in the second derivative and buying back at trough valuations, and then riding the semiconductors up and down.</p><p>And then very interesting, we had a two-year cycle and a three-year cycle in a very short period of time. And then, if you look at this chart, the way the dotted lines work is, we just marked the trough of each cycle. So, we could all put a different definition, actually, on what the beginning and end of each cycle is.</p><p>But for talking purposes, we've just consistently marked the trough. And of course, the trough in the current cycle is 2001. And so, we have '02, '03, '04, '05. '06 is in the can, and that means if '07 turned out to be a trough year, we would have another six-year cycle tying the industry's longest up-cycle without a red bar. Okay?</p><p>But I think, as most of you know, industry analysts are actually forecasting another growth year in 2007, something on the order of 6% or 7% or 8% growth. Some people seem to think it's going to look an awful lot like 2006 by the time the year is through. And beyond that, these same forecasters who are already on record saying that they expect that growth is going to accelerate in 2008. And if those two things do happen, if those two things do happen and '09 turns out to be a trough year, we will have had a nine-year cycle. This is unprecedented territory for global semiconductors.</p><p>So, let's drill down now and look at, what are some of the structural changes that are responsible for this change in the industry's environment. And what I'm going to do right now is focus on the demand management and inventory management side of the equation. And in a moment, I'm going to shift over and talk about the supply side. So first of all, I think we all know that the consumer end markets have been growing faster than the traditional industrial-type end markets for semiconductors. And this is a classic X chart. It looks like an X to me. And it just shows that, in the early part of this decade, consumer overtook business and government spending.</p><p>So, why is that important? Well, let's think about that traditional industrial spender on semiconductors. That company's operating with equipment gross margins in the 40%, 50%, 60% range with product lifecycles, which span years typically. That's still true today, by the way, for most industrial companies. So, when you shift over to the consumer OEMs, the gross margins are in the teens, maybe the low 20s, and the product lifecycles are measured, literally, in months, two, three, four months, somewhat depending upon what the competition does.</p><p>And so, if you're managing inventory and you're in that industrial environment, the name of the game was, don't run out of parts. If you're in the consumer business, the name of the game is, don't get stuck with parts. The prices are dropping. The margins are thin to start with, and the product may ultimately be obsolete, requiring an inventory write-down altogether. So my observation is, I believe that the consumer demand part of the semiconductor industry will be better at managing inventory than the traditional industrial sector, and it's simply the necessity being the mother of invention.</p><p>Another thing that's happening is, in the world equipment market, electronic equipment, the OEMs, the traditional buyers of semiconductors, have been outsourcing at a very high rate. And according to this data, in 2006, about 35% of the world's electronic equipment was produced by a third-party service provider, and EMS or ODM company. And we group these because it's getting more and more difficult to separate the two.</p><p>And so now, let's look at the business model for these companies versus their OEM customers. And I think as you all know, the EMS and ODM community are operating on very narrow margins, in almost all cases, single digits. And yet, they are responsible for carrying the vast majority of the working capital in the supply chain.</p><p>So, with necessity being the mother of invention once again, it strikes me that the EMS community is going to focus on inventory management and pay a lot more attention to getting that right from and ROIC perspective than its OEM counterparts, who have a lot more margin and even the ability to sort of control future production by model that the EMS companies just don't have. So again, I feel tight inventory management here relative to the OEM customers. This business model simply requires higher inventory velocity.</p><p>And then perhaps a controversial statement, but I'm going to throw it out anyway. And Vince said he gave me Safe Harbor so, there's been a couple of interesting accounting changes. One sort of commonly known as revenue rec and another one as Sarbanes-Oxley and specifically, the 404 provision. And what these two things have done, it used to be in the manufacturing world, and by the way, far beyond the electronics industry. This goes into consumer goods and a variety of industries, but when businesses started to slow, the manufactures would push product out into their channels as a way to sort of manage earnings.</p><p>And most of that opportunity has now evaporated as a result of these accounting regulations. And so my observation here is simply that, there is less of an opportunity and less of an incentive for manufacture to push inventory into their channel. As a result of that, generally speaking, inventories should end up a little bit lower.</p><p>Wonder, what is the data say? If we look at the impact of more consumer demand, more outsourcing to third-party service providers, accounting regulations and maybe some other factors as well, the data says that the total technology supply chain has reduced the number of days in inventory by a dramatic amount, obviously influenced by the bubble and the burst. Obviously for the last couple of quarters, there's been a tactical change here based on an inventory correction that's taking place. But, if you step back for a minute and look at the structural changes in the supply chain that are leading the secular change, what you see is less days in inventory.</p><p>So now, let's shift to the back of the supply chain and look at a couple of things that are happening from a supply perspective. So first of all, pure play foundries, so these are companies like TSMC, UMC and Chartered. Now, these companies are growing at a 23% compound annual growth rate, and I think you all know, that is substantially faster than the overall semiconductor industry and the clients that they serve. So, what this means is that, more and more of the world's silicon wafers are being produced by third-party service providers.</p><p>So, what's important about this? Well first of all, in the old days when business was good, all of the semiconductor companies, CI, Motorola, National, Fairchild, seemingly would build factories in about the same timeframe. The capacity would all come on stream, and we would have a supply-induced semiconductor correction. The foundries, now, do not build factories until they have demand from a variety of semiconductor companies, each one of them having their own end-market profiles for the products that they're manufacturing. So, we have a more efficient allocator of this capital than the individual semiconductor companies.</p><p>From a semiconductor company's point of view, the difference now is, if CI were running out of capacity in the 90s, it had to consider carefully when to go build that next, and in those days, you would have said billion dollar Fab and today you say 2 to $3 billion Fab, depending on what kind of output they want to [put it to]. Now what they can do is buy more wafers. And they can do that iteratively, and they can increase wafer orders in the March quarter and they can decrease wafer orders in the June quarter. And so what's happening here is, the -- this notion of excess capacity is coming well under control.</p><p>And aside from the pure play foundries, we also have semiconductor companies teaming in, essentially, joint venture partnerships. There are a variety of ways these things are configured, but the impact is still the same. Now, you have two or three companies sharing the investment and sharing the output, so it's a more iterative or analog approach to increases in capacity. And oh, by the way, underneath this, there are many semiconductor companies who are operating as a foundry for a specific process technology and a specific set of parts for other semiconductor companies. And all of this tends to happen under the radar screen.</p><p>So, these all provide similar benefits to the pure play foundry model, with pure play being the most efficient way to allocate capital in this industry, followed by JV followed, by individual outsourcing agreements. And as a result of this, it's interesting to observe capacity utilization. In the old days, we would go from severe capacity crunches to capacity excesses. So, numbers like below 80% utilization and numbers like, even over 100% you may have heard quoted from time to time in terms of capacity utilization.</p><p>And if you look at this chart, again, this is industry data, SIA and WSTS, it says hmmh, semiconductor capacity utilization worldwide seems to be converging at around the 90% level. And this -- it seems like the volatility, since the big tech bubble, has been diminishing. And that seems like that would indicate a more stable lead time environment and perhaps a more stable ASP environment.</p><p>[Arrow] by the way, I'm not sure how important this is, but the same thing is happening in the back end. Semiconductor assembly and test is highly outsourced. What you can see here is that, as a percentage of the total semiconductor industry, the back end is actually more outsourced than the front end. And very similar to the EMS/ODM model on the manufacturing side, these companies are providing these services to a variety of end customers and multiplexing the factories and the test equipment over a variety of semiconductor companies, more efficient allocators of capital.</p><p>So, is this happening? Is it real? What -- do we have any data that then point to these observations? And if we look at the industry book-to-bill ratio, I think this is a fascinating chart. This industry book-to-bill seems to be converging at a number that looks just slightly better than one as more and more of the world moves to integrated supply chains, just-in-time deliveries now being pushed to build-to-order and poll environments, which Mike will talk to you about later with our EMS panel.</p><p>The semiconductor book-to-bill is absolutely converging around a lower volatility, one plus or one slightly plus over the billing rate. And one more thing, average selling prices in semiconductor cycles have played a big role. So, when you're a semiconductor company and you have utilized all of your fixed assets, you now start thinking about optimizing for profitability.</p><p>And as that happens, you can see that the peak years in every semiconductor cycle, ASP increases played a big role, 8% in '81, 13% in '95, 10% in 2000. And then, what happens in the following year? The ASPs play a role in magnifying the down-cycles. Unit volumes are affected based upon inventory expansion and contraction. And then, that's amplified by average selling price changes. And so, where there's up, there must be a down, and that down exacerbates the cycle.</p><p>So, what's happening now? I mentioned earlier that we're in the sixth year of expansion for this cycle. And what's happening is, the industry currently expects revenue to grow by about 9% this year while ASP falls by about 7%. So, what's going to happen next year? Well, I don't know. And as I told you earlier, I don't want to make any semiconductor forecasts. I'm sure that would be a very dangerous way to make a living. But '06 anyway, is not being flattered by ASP appreciation. And therefore, one might observe, there's nothing to pay back in 2007. And we'll see how long that trend continues.</p><p>So, let me just summarize what we've talked about. So, on the inventory side of the ledger, inventory days are structurally lower as a result of the things that I commented on and, actually, others as well. And it seems to me that if that's true, then there is less false demand being portrayed to the component makers and that it also seems true that, if there is an imbalance like we appear to be in right now, those imbalances should be shorter duration and more mild than -- barring some sort of major change in demand.</p><p>In addition to that, the supply is being better managed structurally, and that means more consistent factory utilization rates. And that should imply more consistent lead times and more consistent average selling prices. And by the way, speaking as a large inventory manager, I can tell you that as long as lead times remain stable at almost any level, the challenge of managing inventory becomes much easier. It's volatility of lead times that creates volatility of inventory.</p><p>And so the conclusion is, we seem to have an industry here that does look like it's going to be less volatile in the future. The correction cycles are going to be more mild, and they also should be shorter in duration. And if that's true, from a stock-picking perspective, does that mean lower beta? Now in fairness, I'm obviously here trying to pitch a point, the secular growth rates are lower. They are re-accelerating here in the last five years, but I think the secular growth rates that we enjoyed in the 90s and the 80s and the 70s are probably never going to come back again. But in return, we seem to have this lower volatility environment.</p><p>So, let me move on now and just talk a bit about Avnet's strategy. This is our vision statement. Many of you have seen this before. It hasn't changed much for several years. And that only comments I'd like to make about this are, one, we really believe inside of Avnet in this notion of delivering value. We view ourselves as a value-added distributor, and not a wholesaler. And so, the markets that we choose to operate in need to have characteristics that provide us the opportunity to add value. And by the way, inside of our company, we define value as benefits minus costs. We also define value as, what are customers and suppliers willing to pay for?</p><p>So, our vision is built around this notion of delivering value. To whom? We think in our business, there are four important constituents, and it's actually vital for us to be able to serve all four. So, we think about balancing the value we deliver between those four constituents. And at the end of the day, we have this aspiration to do this globally and to be viewed as the premier company in our space. And the interesting thing is that we will never actually be able to declare ourselves premier. Only those four constituents will be able to give us that distinction.</p><p>So as we plan for our business, at the Avnet Inc. level, at the operating group level, at the divisions, at the business units within the divisions and at our support groups, we ask everyone to follow this strategic framework. We want to build Avnet's house, so to speak, as follows. At the bottom, you notice that we have this foundation of a performance and value-based culture. The values, by the way, were developed by our employees through an interactive effort. They were prioritized, just in the even there's any conflict. For example, accountability versus integrity, we want to make it crystal what the priorities are.</p><p>And on that solid foundation, we want to build strategies around these three pillars, if you will, profitable growth, operational excellence and people development. And to borrow from Jim Collins, we think by doing this, we will build our company to last. If companies focus on one or two of these pillars and you forget one for any length of time, that missing link will ultimately become a glass ceiling in the company's advancement, and we want Avnet to be a company that out-performs the markets for an indefinite period of time.</p><p>You noticed across the top that keeping score now for us for the last, almost six years, is not about accounting profits anymore. We still like them. We still think EPS is very important, but the way we're going to get there is by delivering economic profits. So, we needed to improve our return on capital to be greater than our cost of capital, and in fact, shooting at a target of 12.5%, which Ray's going to update for you later this morning. But increasing return on capital employed and growing economic profit dollars, we think that's the Holy Grail financially. And we believe if we do all of those things, we can achieve our vision of being the premier technology distribution company in the world.</p><p>So, some of you might recall this chart from a couple of years ago. I pointed out that really, starting in the early 90s, Avnet began expanding globally and then also consolidating within markets that we were already operating in. And you could think of this as our consolidation era. And we grew very rapidly. And we grew our accounting profits and, specifically, operating income at essentially the same rate of sales, even though a lot of the sales growth came from M&amp;A.</p><p>However, we reached the point at the end of the decade just before the bubble burst, we were looking at our CD multiples. We were looking at the change in stock price, total shareholder return, and we were feeling very, very dissatisfied. We had done a lot of work expanding this company and becoming global, and we had not realized a gain. And so, we started asking some outside experts to help us with that. And the conclusion that we got universally was, our return on capital was too low.</p><p>We were providing nice returns for some other folks as we were buying their companies, but we weren't providing the right kind of returns to our shareholders. And so, we launched a value-based management campaign called Driving Value that began at that time, but has since then, been permeating the entire organization. So, we're very excited about this new direction. We thought we had our eye on the right ball.</p><p>And then, this historic industry occurred, and we found ourselves in this restructuring phase. And different from previous cycles, this one was more dramatic. We lost 40% of our enterprise revenues on a quarterly basis. We lost two-thirds of our Electronics Marketing revenues on a quarterly basis. So, this was fairly traumatic, and it lasted for about a couple of years. It went down and didn't come back up. So, we found ourselves restructuring and restructuring, getting costs and debt out of our business, and in fact, to throw some numbers out, over $2 billion of debt reduction, over $0.5 billion in constant dollars in operating expense savings.</p><p>And now ladies and gentlemen, we feel that we have entered Avnet's value creation era. We felt this a couple of years ago. It felt very good in the '04 cycle. We went sideways a little bit in the '05 timeframe. We'll talk to you more about that this morning. But generally speaking, Avnet's results are validating that we can create value for our shareholders, and that's what our company is focused on unilaterally today.</p><p>So in summary, we have a great industry, a trillion dollar total available market, which is very large. It is maturing for the secular growth rates a little bit lower, but there are other cycle -- other factors here like less volatility. And IT spending is now normalizing after a pre-bubble run-up and a post-bubble run-down with the IT spending normalizing, so we feel pretty good about the markets that we serve.</p><p>Since the bubble, the distribution industry, which was supposed to be disintermediated by the dot-comers has literally out-performed other participants in the industry's supply chain. I would encourage you to look at our performance relative to our customers, our suppliers, other participants in the tech supply chain. And I think what's happened is, this has validated that distribution is vital to the tech supply chain. We're vital on a global basis. And maybe one of the things that's helped us out-perform as an industry peer group is that the industry has been heavily consolidated much more so than the markets of our customers and suppliers.</p><p>And within all of that, Avnet has emerged with a leadership position. Scale and scope advantages are absolutely required in this new global tech supply chain. And Avnet is fortunate enough to lead the world in those capabilities. And while we're building our company and leveraging those scale and scope advantages, we are incredibly focused on return on capital and creating value for our shareholders. We're demonstrating that over the last few years, and the best is yet to come.</p><p>So with that, let me just pause this. I think -- do we time for some questions? Okay. Any questions on that material? Okay.</p><p>TOM DINGES, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.: Tom Dinges from JP Morgan, Roy, along the lines of this outlay that you put for us in terms of stronger growth in Asia, more consumer in the supply chain, less volatility in semi, better supply management, obviously a lot less [bullish] effect in the back end of the supply chain, maybe close the loop on it. Ultimately, how does that impact your decisions around how you manage your supply? Because, it always seems as if you guys do a little better in periods of higher volatility, especially in big periods of shortage.</p><p>You kind of are the [buffers] of the supply chain. But, what does that also mean for longer-term decisions around the amount of line cards or the breadth of line cards that you carry? Do you end up becoming a bit more focused? Or, do you still maintain the thrill of broad breadth if these trends in terms of consumer in Asia and those things are going to continue?</p><p><person><nameText>ROY VALLEE</nameText></person>: Okay. It's a great question. Could I have the mic? Okay. Am I on? Here we go. So, you probably might be right that on a relative basis, distribution was able to perhaps react a little better than other participants in the supply chain. But, that volatility is fundamentally bad, even though we may have been relatively good. And my perspective is that, in a more stable environment, it is clear to me that we will generate more profitability through the cycle than we could generate in a high-volatility environment. And I would just ask you to think about the efforts required.</p><p>When the ramp is going up, we're hiring people, training, building new systems, adding facilities. And when the ramp is going down, we're tearing all that right back out. There's separation costs. You might remember restructuring charges in the past that were multiple millions of dollars. I think we've even had situations where we've had to write down investments in technology projects and such, all of this in the effort of trying to maintain strong financials during this volatility.</p><p>With less volatility, all the energy that went into ramping up and ramping down can now go into longer-term, strategic planning, figuring out what role we want to play and ensuring that we are delivering that value and getting paid for that value. So, I feel very comfortable saying that, the opportunity to make more profit through the cycle exists in a less volatile environment. And by the way, when you couple that with higher return on capital, it has an interesting impact on Avnet's ability to generate free cash flow. And, Ray might just touch on that here a little bit later.</p><p>Relative to the line card, we do want to be a value-add company. So, if you think about our Technology Solutions business, Rick will update you in a moment, but we get a large percentage of our revenue from less than ten [of our] partnerships there. And the nature of our model there says, while we want we want to be a segment 800-pound gorilla, the segment we want to be in is a specialist niche part of the IT supply chain.</p><p>If you move over to components, we really are much broader. And we really have these almost conflicting, almost requirements for demand creation, which we have referred to as demand chain services. And then, we have the fulfillment part of the equation, which is supply chain. And the almost conflict is that, the design part requires a lot of training, technical expertise, certifications and focus on a limited number of supplier. And on the other hand, customers would like to source the entire bill of material from one supply chain partner, and that takes us over to broadline.</p><p>I think you're going to continue to see us try to build our line card around having the world's leading two or three vendors by important product commodities and not trying to have four or five vendors for the same commodities, nor trying to have zero or even one vendor on a given commodity. And so, all of our line card decisions are predicated around balancing our demand chain opportunities with our supply chain opportunities and trying to offer a complete to our customers. You might call it support across the board.</p><p>JIM SUVA, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Roy -- thanks. Am I turned on? Great. This is Jim Suva of Citigroup. You went through great length discussing the lower volatilities today compared to previous cycles and years. However, in recent weeks, Altera, Zylink, even Intel and Texas Instruments, all cited their sales outlooks, both due to end demand and inventory issues, and they lowered their outlooks. How do you bridge those recent company announcements with your comments about lower volatility? Could it just be that you're looking at annual data, and the quarterly data is still volatile? Or, maybe just help us bridge that gap.</p><p><person><nameText>ROY VALLEE</nameText></person>: So, I think Harley will probably touch on this more Jim. But, I'll just make a couple of observations. One so, if you think about the supply chain being comprised of distributors, EMS, ODM companies and OEMs, and at the end of that supply chain, which actually is usually referred to as the front, is end demand. And as inventory is expanding and contracting in the supply chain, end demand gets distorted to the component maker who's shifting into that supply chain.</p><p>So in the present time, there is an inventory contraction taking place. As product lead times peaked in the March quarter and they have been coming down from that peak, the supply chain has been compressing inventory. And from a component vendor point of view, it is very, very difficult to separate that from a change in end demand.</p><p>Only when we have the opportunity to look at market data like holiday season sell-through, what is going on with com infrastructure as an example, can we really identify what's going on with end demand? From my perspective, there is a weakening in US GDP, however, ex housing, just housing, which is not a big driver of technology demand, our GDP is back in the 3s, not bad. And on a global level, GDP is above three last year.</p><p>It's predicted to be again next year. We could debate whether it's 3.2 or 3.4 or those kind of numbers, but it starts with a three. So in that environment, including all the emerging countries, it strikes me that the demand environment is reasonably good. And yes, I am looking at a little bit broader perspective.</p><p>Now my second comment Jim is that if we're right about all of this attention on inventory, the inventory correction -- if the EMS community is aggressively managing inventory, which I believe they are, and again, you can ask them later, but I think they're all over this. The distribution industry, you've all seen our results. We are aggressively managing inventory. So, when theirs have changed, whether it's a lead-time change or a demand change or a combination of both, their reaction is going to be sort of fierce. It's going to be intense. And that intensity is going to hit the supply chain in a relatively short period of time.</p><p>And so in the old days, we would have looked at that and said, \"Ah-ha, here's the beginning of the curve, and we're on our way off the table.\" But, what it could mean in the new days is just a very rapid response by the supply chain to get inventory in order.</p><p>And I would tell you from an Avnet point of view, we believe we will exit this quarter with our electronic component inventory roughly where we want it to be. We think we will be fully adjusted. And by the way, in the '05/'05 cycle, which was a bit, at least based on what we know today, it was a bit more dramatic than the current cycle. It took us four quarters to get inventory right back where we wanted it.</p><p>One more? Okay. I'll be back. So, we do have a very full agenda. We want to make sure we get all the material out. And of course, Harley and Rick will be happy to take questions, relative to their group. So with that, let's move on and bring up Harley Feldberg.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG, GLOBAL PRESIDENT - ELECTRONICS MARKETING, CORPORATE VP, AVNET: Good morning, and a pleasure to be here, a pleasure to be in the greatest city in the world. And the weather's been quite nice, so it's good to see everybody. I'm going to talk today, obviously, about Electronics Marketing. And I'll show you a bit deeper dive, a little more detail on some of the environmental issues that Roy just talked about.</p><p>So, let me move in and get started right away. So today, I'd like to talk about Electronics Marketing, the environment, our key strategies, what's happening in the global components market and how we are performing, so I may answer -- give a little more detail on some of the questions we just heard. What are we doing to position Avnet EM for accelerated growth looking forward? And then as we've mentioned earlier, we have the privilege of having some of our customers here who are going to join on the panel, talk a little bit about their businesses and how they interact with us and take some questions as well.</p><p>So first, I'm going to talk a little bit about the key trends that are shaping our market, talk a little bit about market growth, what the current market environment looks like. I'm going to talk about demand fluctuations and the impact on the overall supply chain. I want to talk about globalization and how that's impacting the components distribution business and how we are working to maximize our performance in that area.</p><p>When we look at the market overall, we continue to see sustained growth. Roy showed a slide earlier similar to this that showed at a macro level, the continued proliferation of semiconductor technology all through our lines. So overall, as I think Roy said in one of his closing comments, we're in a healthy, big market that will continue to grow, obviously, with some short-term fluctuations along the way. The other key point to this picture is, if you look at the last 25% or 30% of the graph, you see the illustration of what was discussed relative to less volatility. And you'll see that over the short term, we've essentially stayed in a year-on-year growth of high single digits around 10%.</p><p>And that period has provided us an opportunity to work to focus, primarily most of our energy on creating a more efficient company as opposed to reacting to the ups and downs, which really did make up most of what we were doing in the years prior to that, so a much more stable market with sustained growth going forward is what we believe.</p><p>Another illustration of that if you look at the most recent period, so this bar graph depicts the first three quarters of calendar '06 and then a summary of those three quarters added up. And you'll see again in the red bar, the overall industry growing at around the 10% range. And Avnet EM for that same period, grew just shy of 14% through the first three quarters of the year. So again, good growth so far this year, and we're very proud to say, our business has grown at a somewhat higher rate than the market overall.</p><p>And I want to reiterate again, I think as Roy said earlier, the way we look at the actual served market for EM components is, we take out volume microprocessors and volume DRAMs, because it really is an area that although we participate in, we participate in a small way and it really distorts the numbers. So, we took them out of both the macro market numbers as well as our own personal numbers.</p><p>Greater supply chain sensitivity to near-term demand fluctuations or another way to say that is, the industry is self correcting on a much more rapid basis. So, another way to look at that lower volatility from the other end is inventory management, obviously one of the most critical factors that we all watch. And you'll see again on this slide, the last number of calendar and fiscal periods have shown a relative low degree of volatility when measured as excess inventory in the overall supply chain. So, we see greater efficiency, and we see inventories through all of the constituents in the supply chain to be monitored much more closely.</p><p>Now, take it down one level further. So, we've broken it out here. We were actually talking with two of you before the session started. We went ahead and changed this slide a little bit. Previously, the slide broke out semiconductor vendors and foundries. From our perspective where we fit in the supply chain, they look pretty similar right now. So, we put them together to really illustrate the point, and that is that overall, total inventory and supply chain are being monitored pretty closely with some permutations up and down on a short period. And I think the key here is that the specifics for distribution, you see a multi-year trend of continued efficiencies and managing quite well.</p><p>And then going one level deeper and an opportunity -- do you want to me highlight how we at Avnet EM think about inventory. EM is strategically focused on the quality and positioning of our inventory as much as quantity. So of course, we manage quantity aggressively, because it's dry. It's the return on capital goals that we've set for ourselves. But, the way we operate our company tactically is, we are voraciously focused on the quality of the inventory. At the bottom, it states really a clich\u00e9 for how we want to manage our inventory people. We want the right inventory at the right price in the right location.</p><p>Right location means, if we have product that we primarily sell in China and that particular set has moved to India, we need the internal processes and mechanisms to be able to move than inventory all the while around the world efficiently. The importance of this slide in addition to that comment is that, where we've been working behind the scenes is on the aging of our inventory. Aging is really the most critical element for managing distribution inventory. Slight increases, as Roy mentioned, over the last two fiscal periods don't concern us significantly as long as the inventory continues to be fresh.</p><p>So you'll see here, the work we've done over the last number of years in driving our inventory over 12 months old down under 10%. And that's about the right ratio of where we want to stay. We want to see our inventory over 12 months stay at or around 10% of the total. Keep in mind, that's not obsolete or trash inventory. There are end-of-life situations. There are [defense era] programs that require our holding our inventory for more than 12 months. But at the end of the day, that number, under 10%, seems to give us the best balance and allows us to manage the inventory most aggressively.</p><p>So, another key macro trend is we continue to see globalization of supply chain. As is no secret to anyone in this room, the business continues to migrate a larger degree of its consumption to Asia. And outsourcing continues to be a major factor in how we manage our business and how we design our support mechanisms for our customers.</p><p>So, how are we doing? How is Avnet EM doing in the market, given those key trends and market conditions that I referenced? And I'm proud to say, I think we're doing quite well. So, I don't mind putting up this slide. It's a pretty attractive looking slide. And what the bars obviously show is revenue, and we computed it to smooth it out a bit on a rolling, four-quarter basis. And you'll see the line depicts commensurate operating income performance, which has obviously been quite encouraging.</p><p>I would make an additional observation on this slide that, obviously, the -- I think I better make two points on this slide. One, you see the impact of the Memec acquisition in that it obviously helps us accelerate the size of our business. But, what I'm very proud of is the fact that we were able to integrate the Memec business successfully, hold onto the revenues and continue to grow, all at the same time, which is no small task with a company the size of Memec. So we're very proud of that.</p><p>One observation I would make along those lines on this chart is that, in the most recent period, the September '06 period, is one that is past the Memec integration period. So, there in essence, were no synergy benefits to the September quarter, no new synergy benefits to the September quarter. And in actuality, the June closed quarter was really the end of our synergy benefits, so very little in the way of synergy in the June quarter and all of it gone in the September quarter. So, our revenues have continued to hold up nicely. We continue to grow the business and our operating income and our dropthrough has been very significant.</p><p>The other point I wanted to make, I'll go back to a comment that Roy made earlier is, if you think about the correction that we worked through in the '05 period and you see it depicted here in the middle with essentially flat sales, we were able to hold our operating income percent essentially flat with some minor adjustments, and that is really not atypical. If I had took this chart back a number of years, as Roy was responding I think, to Tom's comment, you would see much more volatility, not only on the sales side, but what we call negative dropthrough inside of Avnet, which did not appear -- occur in that '05 correction period.</p><p>And I believe that's due to two fundamental things. One, I do think overall, the supply chain is becoming much more rational and professionally managed. But number two, we had begun an internal change to our culture by really educating and focusing and changing compensation plans at Avnet going back before the Memec acquisition that focused on return on capital. And I think that really is displayed well by the relationship between our flat revenue and our ability to manage our operating income well through that period.</p><p>Thinking forward, how are we going to continue to extract positive income dropthrough in any market condition? And clearly, the only answer today -- I shouldn't say -- I shouldn't say only answer. The principal answer today is that we've got to be voraciously focused on productivity improvement. So, we have been investing all along, over the last number of years in addition to the Memec deal, in process redesign and automation designed at increasing customer loyalty and improving productivity.</p><p>We've invested significant dollars, in the millions of dollars, in areas like a new flow system designed to allow us to process more quotes. We have a couple of guests today from the EMS industry. And as they would verify, successfully managing and EMS customer is about being able to process a lot of quotes as a ratio to the amount of business you book. So, we're investing to make that process much more efficient.</p><p>Demand planning, clearly to achieve our long-term return goals, we have got to learn how to manage our inventory, specifically, much more efficiently. That means in region and across region to invest [and enact]. In Asia, Asia is the -- is a growth region. We're very pleased with our team and our performance there, but clearly, we have to invest in making that whole region more productive, more sophisticated, bring it up to global standards relative to business practices.</p><p>Global information management, supporting all of that, we've got to have the ability to extract information efficiently and business migration management. The reality is that we have an opportunity that most do not, and that is to couple regions, couple design in one region, fulfillment in another region, and we are investing in processes to do that efficiently.</p><p>So summing up the performance highlights, we believe we continue to outpace the market. We're very pleased with our progress in that area. We see continued opportunities to grow faster than our suppliers in many cases. As a matter of fact, I would go out on a limb, although I'm not making any kind of December projections on our number, what I would say though is, I think it is highly predictable that the -- in the December quarter, the channel will again outgrow the overall TAM.</p><p>So, another way to think about that is the DTAM, as a percentage of the TAM, will likely increase in the December quarter. And although on a long-term basis, that's not a surprise to me, but specifically in the December quarter, that is unusual.</p><p>We'll continue to make progress to our long-term profit margin goals. I talked about productivity. I talked about working capital and specifically, inventory management. And I think the last think I wanted to share with all of you, because we often don't go down too deep from a regional perspective, but I think it's impressive and for me, very important, to show you how we have performed, again over the last nine months or the past three fiscal periods by region.</p><p>So, you'll see that in the Americas, year-on-year, we grew a little bit over 8% with an operating income performance improvement of 76%. In EMEA, we grew about 12%. A little bit of that is currency, yes, with an operating income improvement of almost 78%. And it's uncanny to me how similar those two operating income improvement performances are over two such disparate and different regions.</p><p>And in Asia, where obviously we're investing more so the ratio's going to be a bit different, our sales grew about 23%. And our operating income growth, just about double that, which probably rings a bell with some of you that have heard Roy talk specifically about a goal to manage our growth businesses with about a 50% dropthrough.</p><p>So, how are we going to grow? How are we going to accelerate our growth and continue this progress that I just showed you? So, we tend to think about growth strategies in two principal ways, those that are primarily supplier centric and those that are customer centric. Keep in mind in a distribution business, there are rarely growth strategies that are one or the other. They're always a 60/40, a 40/60, etcetera. But typically, some are more supplier focused. Some are more customer-focused.</p><p>So from a supplier perspective, again primarily around demand creation, design support, I'd like to show you a couple of things real quickly that illustrate how we think about that opportunity. I like this picture a lot, because this is actually the first time at Avnet that we did a demand creation or design change marketing-strategy training program across all regions. So, you see the various slides behind are all essentially the same approach but by different regions, just changed the language and a little of the nuance a bit. But in essence, they're a worldwide campaign designed at reinforcing our desire to play a vital role in demand creation all over the world.</p><p>Another one I wanted to show you that really illustrates a significant opportunity we believe we have in the demand creation area with a bit of a synergistic selling twist to it, so you'll hear us talk quite often about our two principal strategies, design chain and supply chain. This illustration is one that I like to use to help explain what we mean by design chain.</p><p>In essence, design chain reinforces the reality that our customers spend a disproportionate amount of their time, their energy, their focus on a core chip, their core chip designs that drive the differentiation in their product. It could an FPGA in a communications customer. It could be something -- it could be simply a microcontroller application, but customers tend to focus the bulk of their energy on their core chip designs. But, everything around them is very important.</p><p>Well we at Avnet, have an opportunity, because if you think about it, there are very few broadline semiconductor suppliers left in our industry anymore, very few if any broadline suppliers exist such that they can manage the full spectrum of customer applications. So, we see a real role there and a real opportunity to generate activity at Avnet.</p><p>So, here's an example that I thought I want to share with you. I'll go through it pretty quickly, but I think it's a -- in the spirit of a picture's worth a thousand words, this one's -- focuses on a Zylink application where two Zylink sockets are really the core chip in this particular development board. So, what we did and what we mapped out is how much additional revenue.</p><p>So as you see, we call this the cash register slide because as I click each time the total cost of what we can sell to this particular customer increases well above the original $66 that represented the Xilinx sockets. So you'll see here the result is the total cost or total opportunity for us in this particular customer application goes from $66 to $173. Why is this important?</p><p>Because it's a growth opportunity inside of our existing core business, but also this concept is where we're going to really focus things like sales training, sales organizational decisions are going to be focused around the belief that this is a large growth opportunity for us in a very large existing market. So showing that total map there you'll see it increased 62% and created $107 of additional opportunity for us in this particular application.</p><p>Additionally in the area of supplier growth opportunity, we had a very broad line card in the conversation you had with Tom, and yes we have to balance a bit of a schizophrenic reality that our suppliers that want us to do the main creation want a very focused approach. Our engineers are becoming more and more technical as our suppliers' products become more and more technical. But we also have a very large supply chain business that plays to the need for a very broad offering.</p><p>So we balance those two every day. I wanted to give you a little picture that may help you think about that. So again typically in the past we haven't broken out the data this way, we want to start doing more of this to let you see a little bit more of what makes up our business, both from a supplier commodity and customer perspective.</p><p>So in this particular chart you will see the total market TAM, again minus volume CPUs and DRAM, broken out by key commodities. And then you see similarly through nine months how our revenues break out. I think what's interesting here, I guess there are a couple messages I would take from this. One, if you look at the bottom of the slide, it may be surprising to some of you to know that we do $2 billion worth of logic or $2 billion worth of non-CPU, primarily microcontrollers or $1.5 billion worth of analog.</p><p>So we are a very big supplier today and we have a big impact across a very broad customer base. But even with all of that said, there are still opportunities to grow inside of that. We are broad but we don't have everything.</p><p>So we challenge our people to get with our customers to understand where we have holes, where we need to add additional product lines, where we may not be completely filled out, where there may be new product lines that we drive growth. Additionally we see geographic capability for growth. We have areas of the world where our offering is less broad and we're working with our suppliers to fill that out. So again we see some opportunity to grow the business inside of the existing core business.</p><p>So, moving over to customer centric growth opportunities, let me show real quickly how we view the customer landscape. And specifically we do this with an eye towards creating a customer solution that fits that needs of that particular customer fit and also simultaneously allows us to grow profitability. So in a very simple way, we tend to break out customers into three tiers, top tier very small amounts, middle tier a bit larger where distribution has typically played and the third tier where distribution has played in part, and then at the bottom you tend to see MRO buyers and very small customers today primarily handled by catalog houses.</p><p>So we think the TAM splits out about this way with about 70% in the top tier for about $191 billion, 25% in the middle and about 5% of the total TAM existing in the bottom 100,000 plus customers. As we look at our opportunity today, we think distribution handles somewhere around 4% of that top tier, about 60% of the middle and obviously the vast majority of the very small customers at the bottom.</p><p>From our planning perspective and relative to our ability to design in appropriate channels to support that customer set, we see the gross profit opportunity for us breaking out this way. And as you will see the biggest piece obviously exists in the area that traditionally has been our core focus. So today the bulk of our energies and our investments are in that middle tier, we manage that business through regional businesses designed to address the nuances of that particular region.</p><p>But we are indeed investing in strategies and infrastructures to support both the top with our Avnet United Group and the bottom with our Avnet Express Group. And those are groups that look and are designed to reinforce the need for customers in those particular sets. We want to continue to do that and drive growth by those customer segments.</p><p>So last but not least, and the area where I think I'm going to our customer guests to really to talk a little bit about our supply chain services. We've continued to see significant opportunity for growth by refining existing supply chains, making them more efficient, but also developing new ones that meet new developing, always changing needs of our customers. So here's a picture that's meant to depict that.</p><p>We want to continue to develop those services, as I mentioned, so if you take a typical customer, that customer would have a need to supply product to their manufacturing locations if they have them, to their EMS partners, to ODM partners and even possibly to an IDH. They provide data forecast to all of those constituents, at the same time they have a supplier vendor base that they've chosen that they want to connect to those various constituents.</p><p>And we like to depict it this way. This is the world before an Avnet integrated supply solution and we like to think that the role we fill is in clearing up a lot of that clutter, working with ultimately the end customer to be their supply chain integrator to more efficiently coordinate top and bottom. That's the goal we seek in our supply chain applications. No two look alike, and with the introduction of globalization, it now gets far more complicated because it crosses across multiple regions and those regions are changing.</p><p>So we have to be very flexible and mobile. And I think my last comment growth is all of that should be taken in the backdrop of what's happening globally. More and more and more our customers need us to do things for them in multiple regions. It could be design, it could be supply chain, but more and more we're finding ourselves with an opportunity that requires an expertise and an ability to cross regions.</p><p>So in summary, we will continue to create differentiation with our global scale and scope, we talked a lot about demand creation that is a space that is very, very critical today. Today Avnet EM is approximately a $10 billion company and about 40% of that is business where we have had an involvement in the design at the end customer. A very critical business, I'd actually like to see that grow to 50%, so investing in training and resources to continue to grow that.</p><p>Why? Because that business is more profitable than the supply chain business, but also it provides a degree of stickiness and involvement all the way at the end customer and is very valuable to us. If you think back to the synergistic selling slides I shared, if we are integral to the customer making the core chip design, we find our ability to sell deeper and broader is dramatically advanced.</p><p>We want to continue to develop leading edge supply strategies, so this is where we're focused on productivity and efficiency and that's something that's very important to us. We'll continue to maximize growth opportunities in our served market, I talked about the core, spanning out into geographies where we still have room to grow. We'll continue to invest in process redesign and automation. In everything we do, every process we have at Advent, we are questioning whether we can be more efficient.</p><p>We'll create value for our customer suppliers through continued excellence in demand planning and inventory management. It's never been our goal to win the race to zero inventory okay? The goal is to have quality inventory at the right price, the right location and that's what we're focused on and we want to continue to fill that role. We accept that role in the supply chain willingly. We will do all of this with a strong seasoned and prudent leadership team.</p><p>So I want to end with that comment. Although they're not here, I really feel strongly that a good part of why we were so successful in integrating Memec the way we did is Avnet EM has a leadership team that is seasoned, and that is tenured, that is global, that is diverse and that did a terrific job in bringing those two companies together. We added a couple of leaders to the staff who came from Memec, so I would say we enter the future with a seasoned long-term leadership team that bodes quite well for us.</p><p>So with that, do we have time for a question or two?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible], the 40% of your revenue tied to design, how has that evolved over the last few years? How does that vary by region? And what is roughly the margin differential you would get on business tied to design versus core business?</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay. The number is higher than it historically was, Brian, primarily due to the integration of the Memec business. The Memec had a higher ratio of demand creation fulfillment than we did, which is one of the reasons they were so attractive to us. So the number was lower historically, that's higher than it's been and, as I mentioned, I'd like to take it higher. Regionally, all regions have a good portion of their business made up of demand creation, which by the way surprises a lot of people when we talk about Asia.</p><p>But Asia has the same model but the ratios are a bit different. The highest region for us today would probably be Europe, which makes sense because it has the broadest industrial account base. Following closely behind that would be America where we have a significant portion, and then Asia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And the margin difference?</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: And the margin difference at the gross margin level typically runs about 5 points higher. Now to be candid, there are additional operating expenses. Ultimately operating margin is higher, but the gross margin variance is about 5 points.</p><p>KEVIN SARSANY, ANALYST, NEXT GENERATION EQUITY RESEARCH: Hi, Kevin Sarsany, Next Generation. I guess with the backdrop of a less volatile market, and I also heard a couple times talking about the growth in the indirect markets growing faster than direct markets. I was just wondering, it seems like kind of an inflection point, in my opinion, with the lower volatility, is this creating opportunities to grow faster?</p><p>Or is it creating kind of a need when you talk about United and Express to have more and more penetration to sustain your growth? And also I guess, flipping that kind of on its head, you guys are talking lower volatility good for you in managing your business, did that change how the suppliers and customers view you and what services you're providing?</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay two questions in there. Do you want me to try and answer Rick? I guess I'll answer it with a data point and that is the region that today appears to be holding up the strongest, through this morning, is Europe. And that surprises me a bit that Europe is really doing quite well. A bit better than what our expectations were actually when we started the quarter. And in a my opinion a good part of that is due to the fact that the landscape a bit and that is in a region like that our suppliers have not typically been direct resources, they really have been doing the opposite.</p><p>Because many of our suppliers, if you think about it, gain a disproportionate share of their current revenues in Asia. The ratio of most of suppliers' business they get from revenue is higher than what we and the channel in general get because of the different complexion of the market.</p><p>So in many cases we see them de-investing or investing less in the West, which has opened up opportunities for us. And in my opinion, that's part of why the growth is occurring in Europe. Our model and what we offer has increased in value I'll say over the last three or four quarters, because of I think that migration and what they need to do.</p><p>As far as the models, clearly those models are designed at allowing us to expand in areas, especially in Avnet United, in the area where, with our typical core business model, we cannot expand profitability. So what you will probably see, or one of the things that we'll probably need to do in the future, is somehow share the data with you in that space in a different way.</p><p>The reason I say that is, it is possible that the applications that we take to that business opportunity will be ones with nontraditional working capital solutions, they'll be ones with a centralized selling solution with a lower SG&amp;A. So the model is going to look very different and in the some cases the revenues could look different, but as long as we meet our return on capital goals, that's really where we're focused.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: Yes thanks, Harley, Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel. Just to follow-up on your comments about Europe, could you then talk about what you're seeing in the other regions versus your expectations and your guidance?</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: That was stupid wasn't it? How big was that one I stepped into? Okay so as I said, obviously I'm not going to talk about guidance, but I'll just give you some general comments on where we are quarter-to-date by region. As I said, Europe is progressing a bit better than we would have thought and that's terrific. I would classify America as probably a little bit worse than what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter.</p><p>You know it's such an interesting market because we look at the quality of our backlog, we measure cancellation activities on a daily basis and those factors actually all look okay in America. So the backlog looks pretty solid, we feel comfortable going into the March quarter but clearly there's a softening in a couple areas that we can identify that currently make us think that we're a little bit behind where we would have liked to be at this point in the quarter.</p><p>I would make a similar comment about Asia, that Asia looks a little bit less than what we were looking for. The difference in Asia in America is I think my concerns in America are exacerbated by the fact that we're going to lose the bulk of our customers pretty quickly, in a matter of a week or so. In Asia, December is a month that ends a quarter that goes all the way up to New Year's Eve. So it's hard to predict with any accuracy what Asia will end up like, but at least through today we're a little bit behind where we'd like to be. But the month isn't over yet.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN: Okay great. And then just an unrelated question regarding passives and connectors space, noise earlier [the fly] that you talked about it looked like the [decan] for passives and connectors was actually growing, yet you seem to have lost a little bit of share in that market to some competitors in the last couple years. So can you talk about your strategy in that space?</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Sure. I'd like to deny that second comment, but I can't because it's true, so I would say that -- I would if I could. It's still a big business for us, it's still well over $1 billion globally, but we have lost a little bit of share. And I would say, without trying to sound I guess too apologetic, I think the bulk of that loss is really due to a loss of focus as a result of the Memec integration.</p><p>We integrated a very large global company, our first global integration, and that company was 100% semiconductors, and I do believe the team took their focus off of this. I believe we have that returned, I believe the teams are refocused and reinvigorated and are growing that, and I think you'll see those results turn around in the very, very near future. It is a focus for us, it is my personal background so I take some personal pride in that, and I think you'll see us back very quickly.</p><p>VINCE KEENAN: Harley, if we go to the other panel now we can stay on schedule.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay. Okay thank you, Vince. I have the pleasure of introducing these three esteemed gentlemen and let me introduce them and then I'll turn it over to them. Guys, why are they laughing?</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN, EVP, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SUPPLY CHAIN, BRECONRIDGE: They know something that we don't.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: They must know you guys. So to my left, Don Hnatyshin Executive Vice President, Business Development Supply Chain at BreconRidge. To his left, Leon Shivamber, Vice President Supply Chain Management Operations at Harris, and last but not least, Dave Clark, Vice President Material and Supply Chain at Plexus. So without any further ado, I'll turn it over to our first guest.</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN: Good morning, everybody, it's good to see some familiar faces around the room. My name is Don Hnatyshin, I'm with a company called BreconRidge, we're up in Ottawa, Canada. For some of you that aren't familiar with the company, I'll spend a couple of moments on that.</p><p>I'd also like to provide some insight on what's driving our supply chain strategy and I'm happy to hear from both Roy and Harley that the importance of the Tier 2 space relative to this market, which is an area that BreconRidge participates in, so we'll try to give you some insight to what's driving that strategy. I'll talk a little bit about the role of distribution in supporting our strategy and then specifically talk about our relationship with Avnet. So those are the areas that I'd like to cover with you this morning.</p><p>First of all a little background introduction to the company, as I mentioned, headquartered in Ottawa, the company is five years old. We're focused in the Tier 2 space, so you've heard a lot about OEM versus EMS versus ODM, IDH which is even one that I struggled with so, Harley, maybe you can help me with that. But BreconRidge is a pure-play EMS provider. I'd say that we're propensity ODM light in some vertical markets, but we are a Tier 2 EMS company. Geographically we're in North America and in Asia. Our primary market focuses have been traditionally in broad-based communications, both carrier and enterprise, both access and port along with industrial segments.</p><p>I think one thing that we've noticed relative to supporting the marketplace is it's becoming less about vertical end market for us and it's being much more driven by architectural natures of a lot of electronic products. So even though we're focused at end markets that are [calm] and industrial, we're really supporting architectures that have a communications interface. So if you look across all major markets, we see very similar architectures even though they're going into different vertical markets and that is an important growth are for us specifically.</p><p>So that's a little bit about the company. From a revenue perspective we've had a good run, as I mentioned. In this five-year period we're annual growth rate of about 30% a year, the company is profitable. As has been mentioned earlier, this is a thin margin business so execution is extremely important to succeeding and supply chain is a dominant part of what our business is about in supporting our OEM customers. And I've got a unique position within the company where I run Business Development but I also run Supply Chain, so it gives you some sense of how important those two things are linked in our business.</p><p>Now a little bit of insight in what's shaping our supply chain strategy at BreconRidge, again recognizing where we're focused and where our customers are focused. I think a couple of macro issues that we have to take into consideration, the Tier 2 and Tier 3 OEMs, especially in the vertical market that we serve, are really being pressured today with global competition.</p><p>Every day that they wake up there is a new competitor coming from somewhere in the world where potentially a product has been designed in the West that is being manufactured in a low-cost geography. That macro trend which is driving increased pressure on pricing and cost and the portability of moving those designs to a low-cost geography is extremely important.</p><p>So that macro trend is actually creating a lot of differentiation and opportunity from a supply chain point of view, and probably is picking up some of the resources that Roy and Harley talked about where there may be some supply trades volatility that has been removed out of the discussion.</p><p>I can tell you here, and I think Dave may talk about this as well from a Plexus point of view, demand size volatility continues to be a significant issue, both peer demand but also the movement of products on a global basis. so I think that's an important point that's really driving the need for us to be obviously mobile and portable in what we do for us customers, flexibility is absolutely key and predictability is always an expectation. So again distribution is absolutely crucial to the success of our business and supporting our OEJM customers because it is that shock absorber that we require.</p><p>At the micro level, when we look at the market that we're heavily involved in, there are a couple of dynamics that I think are key. On the design for supply chain I think Harley talked about the difference between fulfillment and on the design side, we have a similar issue relative to building out a supply chain strategy for our customers.</p><p>Time to market has never been more crucial, advanced architectures with point solutions of silicon, as Harley pointed out, are all key attributes again that we've got to stay on top of and have design for supply chain really in the process, that's driving supply chain requirement. And then from a supply chain execution point of view, the reality is that we have [tuned our] product life cycles for all of our OEMs, lead time reduction programs are very important to our customers, even though they're going to lower-cost geographies that are tying up a lot of time on logistics going by ship or by freight and by air.</p><p>And then we still have issues where high product mix, low volume, mid volume, there are few products other than in a consumer space today that are truly volume products. So the reality is again driving supply chains here we have a low volume, high mix environment in most of the vertical markets that we serve. Then again back to this volatility issue, we do have limited forecast visibility for many customers, especially in the Tier 2/Tier 3 space where they are not the market leader. They have a bigger challenge in trying to determine when to invest and what to invest in, so that's another important characteristic to this Tier 2 space, which makes distribution very, very key to the success in managing customer service and working capital.</p><p>Role of distribution, I've mentioned a couple of these points. I think traditionally in the EMS world the manufacturer and OEMs historically looked at metrics of being strictly poised on time delivery and quality. We're at a point now where you know BreconRidge is one of the pure-play companies that really started four or five years ago as being much more than contract manufacturing, we're about being an operations partner.</p><p>I think it's probably a similar thing that you'll hear from Dave when he talks about Plexus, but this business is now much more strategic in nature, outsourcing's moved from the commodity of manufacturing and converting [solders] to actually having a significant role in the success of our OEMs on the operational front. And the distribution role for us really crosses the three major pillars that we're trying to deliver operation to our customer, one of them is obviously from a customer service point of view that comes out in flexibility, predictability, mobility, quality.</p><p>One consistent theme in being able to deliver that and what's very important for us in distribution is assets. Harley talked about assets and we are 100% in sync with his comments. One we're [not going to zero] assets, our important piece is that assets have to be available, it's the right assets. We've been fortunate at BreconRidge to work with Avnet and the distribution world about moving the yardstick from assets to basically quality assets through ABC Coding and making sure that we know that if we are engaged with Avnet on Part A, it is a good part for all of us relative to velocity and support.</p><p>So that's been a very important attribute on the customer side. On the balance sheet, you guys are all well versed on the balance sheet issues, our customers are really looking for us and our supply chain partners like Avnet really to assist in managing the working capital and really [avoidance] on liability managing. And again distribution plays a significant role for us.</p><p>And on the P&amp;L side there's two things. One, from a direct cost point of view, it has been a significant change over the last two or three years, maybe three or four years with Avnet where we are in a position to leverage the global spend of Avnet where they're bringing value to the table where a Tier 2 customer like BreconRidge or one of our OEMs actually can compete at a cost level on commodity product with the help of Avnet.</p><p>And then on the [mature of] overhead rate, which is very important to our business, in support customers from an EMS point of view, productivity and the ability to move a large demand and supply program, many parts, many transactions from an automation point of view, globally is key for our business as well, and again we get that through distribution. So again this is a much more complex business than it has been in the past. Most of us that are in the EMS world came from an OEM world. I can tell you OEM environments are light years simpler than running an EMS environment and distribution is absolutely crucial to the Tier 2 space in being successful.</p><p>And then finally for me, our relationship with Avnet and some reasons why Avnet, due to the extent that we deal with Avnet, I think a couple of very important points. One, assets, assets, assets. As for me what that means is I've got in the neighborhood of 20 or 30,000 part numbers fused that I've got to have a supply chain in place. It doesn't matter if it's a $0.01 resistor or a $50 routing part, I can't ship the product to the end customer, the end customer does not have a secondary place to go unless they get it from BreconRidge. So assets are extremely important. Portfolio coverage in that asset space is very important, that's where the line card discussion came up, it's extremely important for us on a global basis to have the portfolio. And then once we've got the portfolio obviously it's to have quality assets in place.</p><p>And as I mentioned, and I can't say this enough, is we have got to have access to that I'm going to say -- everybody's talking globally, but really the differentiator here is all of us have an initiative for our OEM customers where it's high-cost geographies versus low-cost geographies. Really there's a speed to move to a lower-cost geography, I need to be able to access the portfolio and assets and get them into a low-cost geography site. And to do that one of the big underpinning issues for all of us having a global ITIS infrastructure where we can move data and information from a supply and demand point very quickly.</p><p>We're fortunate that we've got global SAP, Avnet's got I think a lead position relative to the industry on the IT side and that works out great for us. A differentiator that's really superior to customer service and that's on a global basis, so that's important, if we didn't have that we wouldn't be able to use distribution to the level that we do in specifically Avnet in this particular case.</p><p>And a couple last points, one is trust is extremely important in three-way relationships. OEM, EMS, ODM the distribution role, trust is paramount. The [inaudible] I know that we've got with Avnet is that trust has been created between Avnet and the supply base and that we've got a similar issue where we count on a differentiator at BreconRidge to be our OEM customers can trust us. And that three-way relationship, four-way relationship is extremely important.</p><p>And from an innovation supply chain solutions point of view, one thing that we've been an early adopter of and helps drive with Avnet in North America as we've seen the pressure to move to focusing our efforts in where our customers want us to invest. We've started to look at how do we do more with Avnet and in North America we've actually outsourced our whole back end to Avnet.</p><p>That goes from receiving all parts, not just components but sheet metal, printed circuit boards, Avnet, Arrow, Motorola, Intel, who you want to do that, Avnet running the whole back end from receiving, warehousing, fulfillment to the manufacturing floor. Those are the kind of supply chain initiatives that we're putting in place with Avnet in North America and in Asia.</p><p>So with no further ado we'll pass it on to Leon.</p><p>LEON SHIVAMBER, VP SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS, HARRIS CORP.: Good morning. I'm Leon Shivamber and I'm here from the Harris Corporation. I want to do three things in the next few minutes, tell you a little bit about Harris Corporation, talk a little bit about what we're doing and what drives us as a business and cross some threads through that presentation about the stuff that Harley talked about earlier and how we collaborate with Avnet, and then end with some comments about relationship with Avnet.</p><p>So Harris is 110 year old company that's based in Florida that's reinventing itself. We are about $3.5 billion large and hopefully growing as fast as we can do it as a management team. We have a very simple focus as a business and it's captured in these two words, assured communications. We are a communications company and we have four divisions which I'll describe here in a minute. But all of those divisions carry the same theme captured in two words in the middle of our Mission Statement, assured communications. So we, in all of our divisions, focus on the kind of customers that value up time and value their communications equipment's really working all of the time.</p><p>And so we operate in four spaces, two of which are government and two of which are commercial spaces. Our two government businesses provide software and hardware to government agencies and to the troops that are deployed around the world, and both of those businesses are domestic and international in scope. And then our commercial businesses, one of which is in the broadcast space, provides transmitters, software, hardware for radio and television customers, primarily in media companies, to get their product to consumers. And finally our Microwave division provides wireless equipment for company's that are providing cellular coverage around the world and private networks and so on.</p><p>We do focus our business on this issue of innovation. And a really important part of what we do is trying to figure out how to get new more advanced technology into the hands of our customers. And so core to us is the issue of managing our life cycles of products, some of which are very short in our commercial spaces and others which are very, very long in the government spaces.</p><p>And so we have to think hard about what we do throughout the life cycle of our products and, more importantly for all of these business, try to figure out how to shorten the time we get these products into the hands of our customers. That means the degree of information dependency in a very, very complex electronic space.</p><p>So given the choice of some 70,000 electronic components and over 1,000 suppliers, we think that it's very, very important to get that equation right up front. And that is one of the places where we collaborate with Avnet to get much better information into the hands of our engineers. 5,000 of our 13,000 employees are engineers that are making decisions every day that could be very mission critical to our business and to our customers.</p><p>And so we want to stack the bar throughout our supply chain in terms of picking the right electronic components right up front. And by that I mean parts that we can get readily available, they're being used by a large contingency of customers that would then stack it in the odds of being able to execute well, parts that we can have at a reasonable cost curve that will continue to be improving over time, and parts that hopefully would last a long time so that we can continue to deliver those products into the hands of the customers without having to reengineer some of those designs.</p><p>So all of those beg for a degree of information and a perspective in the marketplace that we on our own are unable to get without some of the additional market-based information that a company like Avnet can provide us. What Avnet does is they can tell us information about the breadth of usage on a component. Some of this information is not readily available or easy to share directly from some of the electronic manufacturers, and so we find the benefit of working with Avnet in the sense of being able to be better informed about the decisions we're making earlier in the cycle.</p><p>With about $800 million of R&amp;D, most of which is funded by the US government, we are operating in a space that's weight in the front end of the communications marketplace. And with that kind of an R&amp;D it's incumbent on us as a management team to figure out how to take all of this work and drive it into our other businesses and share some of the understanding and share some of the technology into the products that we can get into our commercial customer space.</p><p>And so for us it's vital that we collaborate. We also recognize that we can't know everything about the marketplace or have all the skills necessary to deliver on the promise of taking this technology and translating it into commercially feasible product. And so we think it's vitally important to collaborate with partners who have some elements of our strategy that are necessary and can bring us along. And so the core to our strategy is collaborating, it's collaborating internally, it's collaborating with important leading companies like Avnet and Plexus here.</p><p>Finally, in order to get our products to customers we have to navigate through a fairly complicated topology of supply chain participants. Some of our manufacturing is owned, some of it is contracted and all of that has got to work seamlessly in this complex environment of 70 million choices each day. And so while we want to do a good job up front in picking the right parts, we also want to stack the odds in favor of being able to execute well and move those products around the world, depending on where the demand is going to take us as a company.</p><p>And increasingly you've heard the words globalization and map customization, it's requiring us to be in many more places in many different ways than one would have been able to do earlier in the last couple of decades. And so our supply chain is becoming more complicated. We are doing design work in places that are very far away from where we're manufacturing products, and that requires a degree of coordination that we on our own would be unable to do without the help of a company like Avnet.</p><p>So in summary, what we get out of the relationship with Avnet is this ability to be a lot more flexible than we could be on our own. And that flexibility starts right from the front end when we are able to take advantage of the breadth of services they bring down to us, this deep domain expertise and this understanding of the kinds of technologies that we should be using but then are able to be executed well is a very, very valuable aspect of our relationship.</p><p>And then on top of that, the ability to execute that supply chain flawlessly throughout our own factories or our contract partners' factories, keeping us out of trouble in terms of getting product to the customer is a very, very valuable part of our relationship. And they do that really well.</p><p>DAVE CLARK, VP MATERIAL AND SUPPLY CHAIN, PLEXUS CORP.: Good morning, I'm Dave Clark with Plexus, happy Holidays and happy returns on capital employed. Plexus, we're 26 years old, started out as a product development and design company then quickly merged into what is now known as the EMS space. We use Avnet in many different ways. If you look on the left side of the circle where it says product development and design for supply chains, their SAEs work with us in basically helping consolidating the number of suppliers that can actually meet fulfillment needs.</p><p>And if you look on the right side at the manufacturing supply chain management portion, we have 13 manufacturing sites across the globe from Penang to China, North America, Western Europe. And what we're able to do is, on the design side, work with Avnet, get the [bonds] in place, work with demand planning and be able to go ahead and port that supply chain design for the in-time compression, to support our config to order, build to order, order replenishment type programs at our customers.</p><p>At that point we port that to any one of our 13 manufacturing facilities. So if you go to our Xiamen, China site, our Penang site or [Warez] site and you say, \"Can you show me how Avnet goes ahead and integrates into your supply chain?\" Well we can show you their either supply managed inventory via our SMI Superstore, it could be line-side stocking supply the line for caps resistive IPU type products, it could be a bin order replenishment type of thing.</p><p>And all these things are required in order for us to go ahead and meet our customer fulfillment needs because what we focus on is typically concept, high technology, high [ultra] liability business in a medium to low volume by most peoples' standards. We buy hundreds of thousands of discreet and distinct part numbers and how do we go ahead and manage 1,200 1,500 suppliers to go ahead and design a supply chain compression program. Well when customers give us demand under lead time, we have the right product there, we can go ahead and achieve an inventory service level for their customers higher than what most people do at lead time. And I'll explain later on how we do that.</p><p>So I could take you to all these facilities and say here's how we design it, here's how you we try to consolidate our partners, they have broad supply chain capabilities on demand planning but also a broad line card and we are about to go ahead and together go to the customer and design this.</p><p>So what we do is we sit down with our customers, go through what their inventory service level requirements are, do you want config order, do you want direct order fulfillment to your customers' customers, what do you want and we design it all the way back through the supply chain with an upstream with Avnet. So either on an existing new manufacturing piece of business a specialty where we can design it, we utilize Avnet in both areas.</p><p>So what we're finding customers are looking for. We've actually grown beyond the board level build where most EMS players were five years ago. Plexus, we're looking for [design core] supply chain, [gem cards] development, we're looking for SAE support that can support supply chain models there. It doesn't mean just unit costs. It doesn't just mean a certain print position on the board, what we're looking for is time compression to be able to support our various deployment models in our factories. Customers are also looking for low-cost manufacturing, sometimes at the board level, sometimes config to order/direct order fulfillment out of a North American region, Warez, Scotland, wherever you'd like.</p><p>Like I said, DOF, CTA, it's becoming basically a differentiator for us. What we're finding out is customers, they might have 70% of their demand come up in the last three weeks of the quarter, they don't want to hear about capacity issues, they only want to know that you have supply chain design not only [technical difficulty] but also at the board level [conbon] and be able to config that and ship it direct to their customers.</p><p>So how do we do that? We have to get the component supply right at the factory and work with Avnet's planning systems, along with our own planning systems, and fine tune that. And of course we want to make sure that we preserve our ROCE. You know we have industry [ridden] ROCE, in our space there's only a few players who's ROCE actually exceeds the rated average cost of capital, we feel that we're the leaders, our numbers show that.</p><p>But how do we do that? We basically show the customers value in on-time deliver to request date. What's your inventory service level, we go ahead we tweak the model at the board level conbon and at the [rail] level and we say, \"Look here's which one we need to go ahead and cover this investment. Here's how we can lean out the supply chain and compress lead time.\"</p><p>So we feel this service is a competitive advantage and not only that, I'll show you how that actually accelerates cost reduction. Instead of buying full [corded] lead times at direct semiconductor OEMs or other distributors who don't have these compression lead times in place, while they're waiting 16 weeks to realize that ASP, our customers are realizing that typically in 4 to 6 weeks.</p><p>So here's a traditional perspective, if you go ahead and you take a look at the last either direct OEM or traditional distributor and basically they're price lining product at lead time. We're basically buying to the forecast in a push methodology. And then what we do is we go ahead and we build it at the board level, but it takes longer to build it because [as tons] have gone through the continuum, there's an inevitability. So some parts you don't need, some parts you need so what happens is it takes longer and bottom line in the scenario it's like a 16 week lead time.</p><p>So what happens you have limited flexibility, if you have demands that created [affinity] times you have negative PCV through [expiry trades] buying from premiums, buy from heaven forbid independent brokers, we don't want to even go there, sub optimized plants, you know what I'm saying, you have capacity [inaudible] tied up. So typically that's what we want to move away from.</p><p>In the future of assured supply, here's an example. Leon with Harris Corporation is one of our major customers and what we do is Avnet basically goes ahead and helps us decouple from the longer lead time. So what we're doing is we're basically going out and we plan to the forecast, we get his forecast, we send it to Avnet, we have some industry leading planning tools called OPDM and IRFM, inventory service level management tools.</p><p>At Plexus we combine these with Avnet's tools and what we do is they help us decouple, they work with the direct OEMs that we would normally have 1,000 direct OEMs we'd have to deal with. We can go with one company. They can get a majority of the components and put them on a program where they bond it.</p><p>We will then go ahead and deploy with one of our 13 global manufacturing sites and have a Plexus conbon, and then from that point you do the board build and then it's either direct shipped to the customer or we do a config to order/build to order and DOF to the customers' customer. So what we've basically done is in the old methodology where it took 16 weeks, if you take a look from basically Avnet's rail bond, that first level triangle, we've compressed that to the very end to a four to five week process.</p><p>So that means that, if Leon's group wants to realize sales in under typical OEM lead, time he can do that with less cost, more predictability and bottom line it works. We have ecstatic customers who love it and we've really optimized our total cost. And we do take a total cost perspective on this.</p><p>So basically in summary, Plexus, a $1.5 billion company, [local] has focused on this but the mixed component, we have a lot of customers that expect high levels of service, high reliability in design for supply chain and through Avnet we've simplified that process and basically it helps decouple us from the longer direct OEM lead times. Basically our best-in-class transition process, that's not just Plexus manufacturing transitions, that's supply chain transitions.</p><p>So if you want to get a product that's designed in Lima or [Kelso] and transfer that to Penang, we can do that, we can tread up the same bond, line-side stocking, auto replenishment, SMI Superstore, whatever type of deployment model that we use, Avnet will help port that with us. And bottom line is we can reduce lead times which is a great evil, and increase the inventory service level to our customers and their customers, and that service level becomes competitive advantage. So that's primarily what we do.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay Vince, we have a little bit of time for a few questions?</p><p>VINCE KEENAN: Sure we have time for Q&amp;A now.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had a question for either Don or Dave, if the entire supply chain has changed and EMS's role has come up substantially, why in this cycle are we seeing, and this is not specific about your company, but why are we seeing general inventory building up at the EMS level if there is supposed to be a higher levels of efficiency in the total supply chain at this point in time? It seems that the inventory is no longer at the distributor level and at a customer level, but it seems to have shifted, I'm wondering if this sort of [factors to] sort of where does the spot go.</p><p>DAVE CLARK: I'll take the first shot at that. If you break up the inventory into raw, WIP and finished goods, be general as you look at the channel. Sometimes that inventory may be at a board level conbon that isn't configured in direct ship to a customer or might be in a finished goods conbon, depending on the service level that you've designed for that particular customer. And not only that, certain customers like Harris etcetera, they're driving towards a compressed lead time.</p><p>The industry still has a lot of customers that are on a buy to forecast traditional methodology where they're not trying to compress the lead times. And what happens is, when you hit the brakes on those and you're buying out to 20 [broad term] lead times like we had a while back, well what happens is in that methodology there is an inventory bubble and it occurs where you have a slight over forecasting and over consumption.</p><p>But you really have to take at where the inventory is, is it in raw, is it in WIP, is it in finished goods or finished goods conbon. So what often happens is you'll see the bubble but people won't tell you where it's at. So for customers on our pull basis, typically raw turns in the industry have improved since the bubble, but typically as the EMS industry gets more into config to order/build to order, additional inventory isn't bad as long as your return on capital employed far exceeds your weighted average cost of capital. As long as it's the right inventory, as Harley stated earlier, it's really about having the right inventory. And if it's right or if your customer's paying for it, well obviously the math works.</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN: I would just add to other points to it. So one to your point on the question, the expanded role of the EMS provider is actually driven by requirement to be end-to-end just on converting solder, taking raw material and building it to card level. So to Dave's point, inventory levels are moving up because our role is moving up, it's beyond raw so you have to look at the WIP and finished goods numbers.</p><p>The second this is our customers, when we take on that role, are looking to have a specific customer service model which in their case in many ways is looking to deploy more assets at the WIP and finished goods level, especially on the configuration to order, so that they can basically support that non-linear demand through the quarter. And so again, us having a large role in the EMS community, that's where the inventory is going to sit.</p><p>And the second point, which is probably a near-term spike that we've all seen over the last 12 months and we can debate how much longer it will go on, but we're still seeing some of the affects of the hang over to RoHS situation at the component level. And that still is a bigger challenge than most people want to admit going in, and that has caused many end customers to basically look at planning a migration out of let it to RoHS but not looking to have a write down of inventory. So we're seeing some raw material inventory sitting around for a longer period of time because of RoHS.</p><p>LEON SHIVAMBER: I'd like to add one I guess addition to that, I have a theory that I can't prove that if you could segment out excess inventory in the EMS channel today between top tier, second tier, third tier, you'd see an inverse ratio besides [MS excess to carry]. I don't know how you'd that, but that would be my theory. And I have another theory that says that probably due to the fact the higher up you go the less connected they are to distribution and supply chain solutions, [but that's my own impression].</p><p>DAVE CLARK: Let's see if we can connect those dots later to your theory.</p><p>HARRY BLOUNT, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Hi it's Harry Blount from Lehman, a question for the panel in general. Could you give a sense on how much of your inventory today, or component supply today is purchased through the independent brokers and how that compares to three, four, five years ago? And similarly, how consolidated the purchases are among the top Tier 3 distributors? Just kind of like historical compared to [transverse current.]</p><p>DAVE CLARK: Could you repeat the last part of that question?</p><p>HARRY BLOUNT: Yes and also how consolidated your supply is, if you look at your bill of materials, among the top Tier 3 distributors?</p><p>DAVE CLARK: In terms of the amount of independent or broker buys compared to five years ago, the bubble, it's dramatically less as an industry overall. When you really take a look at the lot of the counterfeiting issues, the RoHS issues and just the assured supply issues, most independent brokers or even a lot of the smaller franchise brokers don't have the supply chain programs in place and it's beyond getting a discriminate amount of product, it's about having assured supply throughout the program deployed in the right manner.</p><p>So in that in terms of the EMS industry in general, I do see more migration to the larger players, your top three players. And part of the reason for that is that the increasing amount of facilities in Asia and other areas of the world where the other distributors may have some global reach, but really they're very regional in their approach and they don't have good transition teams in their supply chain moving from a North America let's say to a Penang or China.</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN: Okay just two other comments on that, one on the EMS that's going through the independent channels, again to Roy's point earlier, they made their market during supply volatility and that is much less of an issue today. So again we don't see much going through the independent channels because of that. And then access to inventory out the back door of EMS has really collapsed I think in general in the West, still a challenge in Asia, so Asia I think there are still some issues that need to be borne out there.</p><p>And relative to the consolidation of spend through the major franchise distribution channels globally, again our customers are getting much more focused on customer service and speed of running the business in a very difficult market and it has to be predictable and flexible. And you can't do it without a strategy and you can't do it without the Tier 1 distribution guys.</p><p>LEON SHIVAMBER: For us given the importance of synchronizing the front end and the back end, we have pretty outlawed independent distribution and are trying to get it to zero. Obviously it's a lot more difficult because they coming back into the engineering organization.</p><p>But we fundamentally don't think that there is a value proposition that we could use there and we are asking our top tier distribution partners to take on that responsibility of assuring supply to us. I would say that we have about half of our business in the top tier and want it to be a lot higher and have been working to try to figure out how to do that. I think there's a lot of synergy between what their strategy is and our needs.</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN: Yes if I could just take one point back on the independent side of the world, the one thing that we will see is, as we sort out this mix issue on RoHS, the reality is they'll find ways to participate I think for a period of time on supporting the gaps in the RoHS issue with a lot of inventory moving around because of that.</p><p>JIM SUVA: Thank you, Jim Suva, Citigroup. Quickly could you talk a little bit about your decision tree? I assume you use both Arrow and Avnet as they both have very robust systems. And then what about your use of the global Asia company [World Peace]? Do you primarily stick with Arrow and Avnet? Or do you also employ World Peace?</p><p>DON HNATYSHIN: I'll go first, Dave. Just a slightly different probably opinion at BreconRidge versus Plexus from a standpoint that we're a mid-tier Tier 2 company. But relative to the difference between Arrow and Avnet, again it gets down to at the end of the day execution and the breadth and mix of assets. So from an execution point of view, having global sites and multiple sites, the IT infrastructure is pretty key and the asset management is pretty key.</p><p>So both companies obviously very good companies, industry leaders, but today what differentiates the Arrow share for us on the decision tree is number one, are assets available, quality assets available to manage our business and what we're looking for.</p><p>And then number two, have we got the IT systems or the plumbing in place that we can effectively communicate so that we can take that volatility and turn it into a predictable supply. That has been the decision tree and we monitor that on a weekly basis and it's always managed cumulative over a period of time and at the end of the day performance drives decision making, and right now that weighting is on the Avnet side.</p><p>Relative to World Peace, World Peace again because of the vertical markets that we're servicing and the lines that they've got, we don't see as much of a play for us. And it's still early in the supply chain world in Asia so it's still a buy/resell environment.</p><p>DAVE CLARK: For Plexus we use both Avnet and Arrow. In Asia we have gone ahead and investigated World Peace, used them in a very limited fashion. They really don't support our design centers in Penang, North American or other locations, so we're really not getting that end-to-end design chain services that we really need.</p><p>And also participation in advanced supply chain programs like line-side stocking, our supplier managed inventories, those types of things lean more towards the pull environment. Not to say that they might not be looking at that down road, but typically our high mix, low to medium volume type of business requires a different agile model and we haven't seen that agility so far out of World Peace in my opinion.</p><p>LEON SHIVAMBER: Our primary partners are the two of these. We think that we need to kind of continue to support our engineering teams here in North America, even if the product is being manufactured in Asia. And so most of the business we do with World Peace would be transactional not strategic in nature. You know for the little edge you might get in pricing on the commodity items, we lose the advantage of being able to provide those engineers with the kind of support they need.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay Vince, if there are no further questions, I'll turn it back to you.</p><p>VINCE KEENAN: Okay I think we're just about up to our break now, so we're going to be back here in 20 minutes. I would ask that everybody just come back in about 20:50. Thank you.</p><p>[BREAK]</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA, </nameText></person>COO, AVNET, INC.: Thank you Vince, good morning everybody. I'll give you a second to get back to your seats, to get the refresh on the coffee. Let's try to keep it on track. I'll be up here in two roles this morning. First some commentary from the COO perspective, the role I've had since the beginning of our fiscal year, this fiscal year in July. Then I'll put my other hat on we'll dig into Technology Solutions and a little more resolution.</p><p>And we'll wrap up with a customer panel from the TS side of the equation. We've got a number of -- three of our top customers this time from the TS side, three bars representing the principal geographies as well as a technology focus for our enterprise distribution business in North America. All right? So again welcome.</p><p>I thought I'd start with data that has been covered a little bit earlier and Ray will actually amplify on going forward. When talk about operations at Avnet the total scope and scale, what does it look like from a snapshot? So here's just some fun facts along those lines, for FY'06 as you saw earlier, the TS/EM split. Geographically if you look at the bottom for FY'06 51% of the enterprise revenues from the Americas region is getting very close and if you heard about the growth rates in Asia and EMEA compared to the Americas it's getting very close where Avnet could cross over or will cross over to less than 50% from the Americas overall and that will be a first for us in our evolution.</p><p>I think you'd be most surprised if you'd understand that from a COO's perspective it's all about executing to the vision so I'm going to drill down a little bit on our performance management, what that means, our balanced scorecard approach and what we try to do drill down on the portfolio below the broad enterprise group at the regional level. We'll talk a little bit about profitable growth and then what we're looking for as far as ramping skills and scale opportunities across the enterprise.</p><p>[Draw] up the balanced scorecard. And what I'm trying to hit here is that we do tend to -- we're trying to make sure we address all the constituencies, two constituencies you see in our vision statement as part of our enterprise level scorecard. Within the global objectives there are specific targets and plans both on a short-term, i.e. current fiscal year basis and a longer term, i.e. three-year planning basis. The two that I have specifically identified here are two that we talk about quite a bit.</p><p>At the enterprise levels we turn on capital employed and then within a lot of the groups and regional measurement cards we use a pretax metric of 30% return on working capital as a proxy for 12.5% gross [inaudible]. As I'm sure you can understand if you try to take down the balance sheet to lower and lower levels in the organization how you allocate certain elements on the balance sheet probably it becomes more problematic.</p><p>So very often just below enterprise and group level the metric really gets translated into return on working capital which is why you'll hear so much about that particularly from the group presentations overall. The rest I haven't gotten specific as to what those targets are but I would assure you the way we manage the business, the major [cross-kit] and dashboard we use to manage the business has specific goals for each of these measures again, both on a current fiscal year basis and then a longer term three-year outlook.</p><p>One of the influences I'm looking to have I guess from a COO enterprise level perspective would be not only to follow up on our well today I would say well-ingrained culture of watching both the income statement and balance sheet from a group and regional level but also looking at the portfolio management below the level. Harley spent some time illustrating the different particular customer segments if you look at from Avnet and United versus the mainstream business versus what's new AvnetExpress. That's one way to go.</p><p>You can also take a look at the metric by supplier relationships. You can look at it as customer type not just as large, medium or small. You can look at it as semiconductor customers versus [IP&amp;E]. You can look at it as IT customers versus component customers. You can look at it as who's doing design wins, custom design win product flow versus commodity product flow. There's a lot of different ways to cut down below the portfolio and we take a look multi-dimensionally I would say below the regional level to really ferret out and find out our heat map on where we should be spending out time and attention regarding working on overall goals.</p><p>And more importantly the COO overall had not existed for the past eight years at Avnet. The last COO was <person><nameText>Roy Vallee </nameText></person>and Avnet had grown a little bit along the way both in scope and scale overall. So I'm also taking the time to make sure that learn, to particularly learn the component business. Those that know my total background with Avnet I'm just celebrating my 23rd anniversary but up until this new particular role as COO I spent almost all of the time with the computer business.</p><p>So I'm been spending a lot of time connecting with Harley and his team to understand the nuances and the real details of the component distribution business but I'm also taking a look at the way we measure and manage the business, and the way we take a look at the classic measurements and how we find correlations.</p><p>Now some are tried and true and certainly are not under any particular scrutiny. What's happening with book to bills and all these types of things but can we find other relationships? Can we ferret out where the real meaningful measurements are? The real relevant measurements and then help us either on a leading real-time or lagging indictor basis to get to something.</p><p>What about across the groups? Are there signals that we could take and some of you were asking me about this morning? Are there signals that we could take from the technology solutions of the world and the IT market to give signals back into EM, into the component, looking for these opportunities, trying to find ways to measure, manage and improve our ability to react and plan for the marketplace.</p><p>Operational excellence is one of the pillars that Roy talked about -- he talked about our basic fundamental house and approach to strategic planning. I'm going to build this one up for you. I would tell you that I consider this particularly in a slower growth and perhaps more stable environment a very important dimension of cultural change that could be impactful to us I believe as VDM has been over the past few years.</p><p>You've heard a lot of talk today and you see a lot of the results reflect how we went from complete focus on earnings and EPS to a more balanced approach, to return on capital and the way the team has responded and the how the results have responded.</p><p>I believe in operational excellence is another cultural shift and change for us to bring in a sincere appreciation for great process as part of the equation overall and not just look things in isolation but really take a look at every step along the way to make sure that we're not only executing well to the current process but taking a look at can we get steps out of the process, can we evolve the particular process, can we find a better way to do things or for that matter could we find partnerships somewhere that would serve it better depending on the activity itself.</p><p>So I made the process level we've now taken a look at categorized into three major categories of customer engagement, supply chain management, order management. And we're trying to bring this again cultural shift and mindset change throughout the organization to not just treat quality as did we ship an order on time? It really goes end to end and oh by the way, the job is never going to be done. We just must embrace continuous improvement as part of the overall commitment to the future.</p><p>Specifically to the people side of the equation on the balanced scorecard and the customer side of the equation on the balanced scorecard another vision that we hold true is the connection between employee engagement and increased performance and profitability for the business. You can read the chain there as well as I do. You can't read the bottom there that was attributed to -- it's something we have excerpted from an article in The Harvard Business Review but it's used again internally with our teams to help them understand why we put this employee engagement on the balanced scorecard as a key performance metric and how we get from the connection from engaged employees to improved results.</p><p>We actually, starting three years ago and brought in some outside help on this particular endeavor, a company called Watson Wyatt who has worked to perform a global employee engagement survey for us for the last three years. Watson Wyatt's value-add to us is not only in the execution of the survey but also just the way it's asked, the way the questions, the way the proposals are presented and the way the feedback can be used to actually create meaningful plans to address what's important to our team. In addition to watching how we do they also provide being a service provider to a large and wide number of industries and companies.</p><p>They give us benchmarks from a global norm basis and then what they categorize as top-performing norm basis. So if you have a particular metric is the goal 100% or is the goal 73 or is the goal 68, how would you know how to set those? Well in addition I guess to the professional conducting of the survey we'd get this feedback that allows us to have some very meaningful GAAP analysis as well as for that matter very strong indications of where we stand in strength to be able to shape our strategic plans in this particular area.</p><p>We're taking a similar page out of the playbook now to address customer loyalty. We'll be engaging with a company called Walker Information out of Indianapolis, Indiana and many of the businesses throughout Avnet for many years have been measuring what we would call customer satisfaction are very typical as you would expect one to five, one to ten type scales.</p><p>What's your likelihood to continuing doing business with Avnet, trying to track certain elements of behavior and attitudes towards Avnet. Jumping in on particular hot issues when it need be. But Walker Information has brought a value prop to us around not just tracking customer satisfaction but actually taking a look at the combinations of behaviors and attitudes that lead to customer loyalty. So the drivers of customer loyalty, what activities they value, this is all going to be brought to us in a meaningful format that gives us actionable data to be able to shape our overall plans.</p><p>And what's the goal of that? This is from Walker Information. This was a study they did in 2000 accounting the 2005, across an IT section of customers both hardware and software companies where again they have a 2 x 2 matrix that will actually address customer loyalty both on a behavior's and attitude's basis.</p><p>And if you're in the plus category on both dimensions that's considered a customer loyalty dimension. If you're missing either one of those or of course both you're in a different category. They have a way to categorize whether you're a loyalty leader or a loyalty laggard. And the discrepancy in the results have been quantified here as part of the study around the three-year average revenue growth, the operating income growth and the stock price performance of loyalty leaders versus loyalty laggards.</p><p>These kind of data as you can imagine certainly caught our attention. So balanced scorecard looking through the elements of performance. Now we're going to talk about growth a little bit. In many of the growth specific growth strategies are derivatives of some of these major impressions I will give you here driven at the operating group level both for EM and TS because as Roy illustrated at the very beginning you've got -- you're playing in two different parts of the supply chain and you're dealing with two very different and fragmented customer sets even though in some cases the total product flow will go from one to the other involve similar products.</p><p>Customer loyalty and retention I've already talked about but certainly I think we hold dear and age-old rule that says if you want to grow the first thing you've got to do is stop shrinking. So hold onto the customers you've got, take care of, that's a very, very strong and stable base. Then you can start talking about growth. You've got a whole in the bottom of the bucket sometimes you can't fill the top of the fast enough to be able to make net progress.</p><p>If you're holding on and taking care of your existing customers then you follow through with expansion both on a new customer basis as well as new products and services to the existing customers. You can take a look at how we round out the technology offering. There was a question I think earlier for Harley around [line card] strategy but also we look at TAM to DTAM shifts and incremental services we can create to help effect that particular change.</p><p>Looking for new product and technology introductions, where are the growth leaders of the future, where are the emerging technologies, the emerging solutions segment that makes sense and where we think our value can play. And then strategic and complementary additions both from again a technology portfolio and sometimes from the geographic basis.</p><p>And we do have -- we do look for some services and market extension opportunities. Two small businesses within the portfolio today. One is a Avnet managed service business that actually works primarily through TS but also with some other IT vendors on providing hosting services, data center services for a channel. And our Logistics business we're also developing and starting to book revenue as a 3PL provider to others, very often our existing supplier base but not limited to that around just handling logistics even if we don't handle taking title, taking the working capital on etcetera.</p><p>Performance, profitable growth, let's talk about scope and scale across the enterprise. You can imagine so Avnet now clipping along at $14-plus billion again you saw all the statistics on the number of locations, the number of presence in the countries etcetera. So again our COO coming in with a full-time focus now trying to take a look at the $1.3 billion of operating expense that we have essentially built into our plans this year, okay?</p><p>Where are the opportunities that make sense? Where's it all going? Determining as I said the heat map, where the value-adds are, where the resource allocations should be piece by piece by piece by piece. And not only drilling down just on the groups but looking across the organization with the help of our global functional line leaders in support areas such as HROD, finance, logistics, and IT.</p><p>Concurrent with the re-establishment of the COO role for Avnet in July, the beginning of our fiscal year, we also moved in these four key areas of [inaudible] to a global functional alignment where you always have that debate on should the regional presidents have hard-line and when the global leaders have the [guide-line] etcetera. Well in the case of these support areas we actually went to a hard-line to a global leader and then guide-line to the local regional level again looking for opportunities for scope and scale, sharing best practices even within these particular areas as subsets of an overall global scope and strategy attack plan.</p><p>The concepts of looking for opportunities for over-rides, redundancies and better leveraging and sharing this applies to the group and the regional activity as well. It's not just an Avnet enterprise issue. It's not just IT and logistics. You can see these -- I think again Harley had some comments in his presentation around where these opportunities exist, paying for TS, and as we continue to grow build out and grow the business particularly if we continue to expand the geographic footprint which may be more relevant for TS but certainly I think be for Avnet overall.</p><p>How can we make sure that we look for those opportunities to establish that scope and scale leverage and keep a maximum amount of resources focused in the highest value activity areas for us. And the scorecarding process internally back somewhat of a time to performance management. It's not all about just putting up a scorecard and who's the As, the Bs, the Cs, or whose the reds and the greens? It's also about where we can sort out and take a look at top performing areas, hey let's dig into that a little bit? What are they doing right? We don't want to kill the entrepreneurial spirit within Avnet.</p><p>We're not trying to say everything is going to come from the top down so lots of great ideas happening in various areas, regions, countries of the world. How can we bring that back to the organization to be able to be leveraged and shared? Burning the organization is the term I use not just about lining up the scorecard and holding people accountable -- that's certainly part of it, but it's also about dealing with -- understanding where the top performances are, how that's being done and making sure that we learn from that across the organization, a very, very valuable part of the process as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>So I'm sure there's no surprise when it comes down to COO agenda it's really about taking the vision that Roy has laid out for us and turning it into executable reality and I summarize it at the end very similar to what I did at the beginning.</p><p>As a COO I think you'd be disappointed if I didn't make it clear that it's all about delivering on the results. Our definition of profitable growth is very heavily steeped in economic profit dollar growth due to our commitment to return on capital and in Roy's vision, his specific word, premier, I believe that my contribution to Avnet can be to achieve the premier faster and as opposed to the previous management construct now, again as COO I will bring more of a full-time attention and detail to what we can do on the enterprise-wide agenda and a balanced scorecard.</p><p>All right, so that's from the COO perspective. Now I think the wrap up on that particular portion but I'll pause here and see if you want to ask any questions on that particular set of topics or slides. Yes, [Steve]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Rick, qualitatively all that makes sense. Can you talk about maybe where the dollar opportunities are the biggest either from a growth standpoint or leveraging your scale standpoint? What would be the most attractive near-term opportunities to get something that we'd see on the bottom line?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Yes so the growth opportunities, Steve, will actually -- when I go down in TS I'll talk about growth strategies there and I think Harley addressed in EM. On the cost side of the equation I'll tell you at the end of the day for us it still comes down to about 70% people. So beyond that and I break down again what's happening in our facilities, what's happening in P/E, what's happening in -- that's all being prepared but at the end of the day it's 70% people. That's the best word I expect it to come down to.</p><p>So it's really interesting. As we look at how we make investments in the business the only two sort of step function investments we have our IT and logistics, whether it's by facility or long-term lease commitments, right. And that's what we're trying to balance in this new structure is maybe a regional executive says, \"Hey, I'm trying to hold expenses tight.\" But maybe the logistics leaders says, \"Hey, we need to plan for some expansion in the future. The growth has been good here. I want to go get a new facility,\" and we work those out in checks and balances internally to the organization overall.</p><p>But as far as the big pieces of the pie from that $1.3 billion it's still about 70% people. But I'm drilling down beyond that to understand because again 1% savings, 13 million, what about 2, what about 5? But I haven't set a specific goal in my mind that well I'm just going to take 10% outright. I mean I haven't come to that conclusion yet overall. Yes Jim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes thank you, a quick question, you guys have done a lot of very successful acquisitions and integrations of those. Can you talk a little bit about what the true organic growth rate has been and kind of as we look forward what one can kind of expect from an organic standpoint as you kind of run the operations?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Ray do you have that in your [inaudible]? I think when Ray gets up he's not going to have a complete financial overview Jim. I think he'll have some specific data on that for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Anybody else about the COO? Okay all right, let me switch hats. Let's see how things in Technology Solutions, okay? Again, I'm still wearing two hats today. I would also give you an update that we've announced and set out as a goal that I will be needing a replacement for myself in the TS Global leadership role here. We launched the process in July.</p><p>We're at the point now where we are working through a short list of very promising candidates and I'm always hesitant to try to set a deadline but I'll just let you know process in work here. We've got some very exciting developments and opportunities and still looking forward. That's on my short list of priorities here as we head into the new calendar year although I still love this business. I love the people and I love the customers in it too.</p><p>But we're going to talk about from a TS perspective positioning, performance and trends. Growth strategies we'll dig into that a little bit, teaming along with financial goals and then we're going to bring up three real-live [lawyers] to take some questions from the group here and we've done our best to prepare them on how typically, how non-specific and nice you are.</p><p>This is the value chain positioning for TS overall. You've seen this slide probably in various formats over the years, tried to combine it all on one just to paint a picture. The percentages are -- this is out of the TS global revenue for FY'06, enterprise distribution being some of the most familiar business that we talk about here led by our relationship with Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Network Appliance, EMC etcetera. System component distribution heavily led by our great relationship with AMD.</p><p>Embedded solutions more around the single processor computer, custom design, we're going into an OEM base. And we still are involved in a networking and visual display business in EMEA a hold over from one of our acquisitions where we're the exclusively authorized distributor for a Japanese [mono-known] company known as ISO in eight countries in Europe. So that's the general strategic flow and the specific individual data points on coverage, presence, and percentage of revenues for FY'06.</p><p>By the way as an asterisk -- it didn't make the slide, reported revenue in FY'06 with TS $4.99 billion. If you take the AES portion out which many of my other data points will be without the last end-user business we divested in February of this year. The FY'06 number would be adjusted to 4.878, about a $110 million difference between the total reported number and what was in AES for FY'06.</p><p>This particular slide is representative of that as well. I did put the little asterisk up there below the top ten, but this is the pie, the breakout for our FY'06 from a supply or relationship point of view. So as Roy mentioned earlier the top ten being a very strong and dominant percentage of our overall revenues. I think Ray is going to show some impacts of the Access acquisition and I actually have a slide at the end of this that we'll get into that will talk about some of the highlights there. But it's obviously going to add another -- that 2% SUN/STK pie piece there is probably to grow somewhere in the neighborhood to 25, 28% and will help the balancing out a little bit from an overall perspective.</p><p>Very often on the calls get drilled down to what's going on with hardware, software and solutions, what's going on with proprietary versus industry standard service etcetera. So I just grabbed a couple of data points. Over the FTY'04 to '06 timeframe and this data is strictly from the Americas. I just want to be clear. So again the Americas represent roughly 70% of our overall TS revenues and so it's a very strong representation of the global business but I also have the best data resolution in the Americas and I just wanted to share a couple of data points on hardware base.</p><p>So over that time period, '04 to '06, in FY'06 servers represented 48% of our total hardware number. Okay? IA servers are now roughly 21 or actually a little more than 21% of our total server revenue. So that first bar chart is what percentage of servers are IA servers. Now I did some real deep -- I went some real deep digging with the team to make sure I understand how they categorize and how they're doing it. This is without HP Integrity servers in the IA number, technically Integrity server is [90/64].</p><p>If I added HP Integrity that number would be 35% just so you know. But there's been a lot of concern about hey Rick, this proprietary is eroding. Things are moving to more industry standard servers. How are you guys going to react and respond to that and I would ask you to keep these trends in mind as I show you the next slide which talks about the operating performance of TS over the exact same time period. So that's one data point on IA server mix.</p><p>The second one was just around storage solutions, and again for storage solutions for us they do not include hard disk drive. And they include not only the separate and discrete relationships of Network Appliance, EMC, StorageTek, I tell you it also includes those line items from our major OEMs that are sold as stand-alone or add-on storage as opposed to concurrent with a server. That's the way we cut it.</p><p>And Storage had moved from 24 to 26%, actually of total hardware, so remember IA servers was a percentage of servers, this was total hardware. I didn't do it to confuse you. I just tried to make the point along the way. The real point is that even though hardware overall as many of you have followed TS over a number of quarters, the hardware growth in the aggregate doesn't appear to be very exciting.</p><p>There are growth stories going on within the hardware particularly in industry standard servers and storage solutions that we are paying attention to. We're all working making sure our positioning and our value props are very relevant and we're trying to capitalize on this and make sure we're allocating the proper attention and resources to these segments as a fundamental part of our overall growth strategy.</p><p>So keeping again those trends in mind including the shift in the IA server space here is the same look that Harley gave for EM -- this is for TS. It's revenue on a trailing 12-month and operating margin, percent of sales on a trailing 12-month basis. Something we are very proud of and of course you can't go without mentioning the great team that finds a way to be able to do that quarter in and quarter out. The September quarter actually represents our 13th consecutive quarter of continued growing 12-month improvement in operating margin as percent of sales.</p><p>Okay that's been a little bit about what's been happening -- what's happening out in the market today that we're keeping in mind as we try to respond to it. Again, those who've followed TS for quite a while you've heard similar themes around solutions and standards and then globalization. But we still believe that IT spending decisions are being heavily driven by business results, time-specific activities are expected to impact expected results as opposed to technology for technology's sake.</p><p>Certainly the adoption of industry standards overall -- by the way it's happening both in hardware and I think it will eventually start rolling into software as well. However, standardization also creates more choices which I believe creates again a value creation opportunity for us. And by us I'm speaking inclusively of the value partners who mean so much to this business.</p><p>TS has realized for a long time in the enterprise distribution space if our partners aren't growing we're not growing. That's why we adopted the PEG line accelerated to your success for so many years it really comes down to not only can we do to grow the business but what we can we do to help the partners grow their businesses. More standards to mean more choices to sift through, and more choices to sift through I think creates a value opportunity for that consulting or if you want to call it design win engagement even from an IT perspective.</p><p>Globalization has not been as stark as the impacts on the EM business. But there is more and more attention coming to global scope and scale from some suppliers as they look to rationalize their regional channel strategies particularly in Asia-Pacific and Europe. There's also some sense particularly in my OEM customer segment there is some growing demand for some multi-national support and coverage overall. Instead of just building everything in the US and trying to export it out to some of their -- outside the America's operations can we set up and can we establish some operations in other theaters to be able to help them with their overall business.</p><p>And industry consolidation at the distributor level the headlines just keep coming. I know you all follow these. The top three are three different ones that Avnet has been involved in. The bottom three are three relatively recent ones that [Errol] has been involved in. So it appears again similar to what has transpired for the component business seems to be a growing sort of global chess match going on with the enterprise distribution model now between two established industry leaders.</p><p>This is just to amplify on my point around what's triggering investment decisions today in technology and it has evolved beyond, \"Hey this product is cool, or hey this product is fast\". And it's much more about really I don't care about the product but I need increased productivity, I need to grow my revenues, I need to increase my customer loyalty. It comes down to business problems that have to be solved and that's what's driving the investment these days.</p><p>How are trying to capture, get more relevant in a solution's based world, so we continue to look at the expansion of our particular solution offerings and what kind of partnership and ecosystems we can get involved with. These names up here are just again recent. Notes and headlines that come out of TS on new partnerships, opportunities and strategic launches we've had certain relationships. In addition to the solutions offering looking at the core portfolio of technology.</p><p>Obviously a large investment a more than a doubling down on some and I'll have some highlights on the Access graphic, details at the end. But we look in specific vertical areas. It's not just go after lines but take a look at enterprise mobility. Take a look at audiovisual solution. Take a look at healthcare. Take a look at maybe the government sector. What's important, what's relevant, who are the leaders and how can we bring them into the mix to be able to be in a position to offer more total solutions to a channel?</p><p>And [Health Tech] is again something we launched in FY'06 built around we're actually selling this, a look at our customer base looking at companies like McKesson HBOC, and [GD Medical]. And we started to add up. We're already in healthcare to the tune of X-number of hundreds of millions of dollars and we haven't even focused on it.</p><p>What if we became more sensitized to exactly what that world is experiencing and we took a look at the growth rates in healthcare for IT and got pretty excited about that. And so what else can we do to deepen our value proposition in this particular segment? And by the way how can we prepare a reseller's network that wants to go this path as well to be able to be rather than necessarily value-added in this particular space.</p><p>And so it's a little bit of shaping structure now on a little bit different basis than just based on a product or a technology. And getting some very, very good results out of the initial. On the government side we have not had a strong offering there from a TS perspective. Have been looking at it and working on it, an interesting part of the Access integration and acquisition will bring us constraints certainly with some Federal processing. We're looking to see if we can extend that and use that as a basis for an expansion in the Federal for our overall business.</p><p>And then OEM solution segment again talked about the embedded solution space overall, single-use server appliances, targeting ISVs and delivering and helping to shape appliance offerings. The spread of storage solutions for a variety of applications coming up these days [vigil signage] included and looking on storage solutions for a second tier of storage-related providers being able to essential sort of a new in quantity contract manufacturer for them in certain cases. Certainly very, very good at the kind of proof of concept and getting first articles done but moving into again quantities that would not be generally of interest, of [hiring somebody] that could be bread and butter for us.</p><p>The TS on the strategic plans on you saw the house earlier. We try to balance all the strategies around growth, productivity as well as on the people development. Committed to the same core values, committed to the same vision of the performance and value space culture of excellence.</p><p>Drill down on the Americas overall the pie represents the growth between enterprise distribution system builder and embedded -- that's that OEM segment today. What we're doing in the Americas, shore up where the growth is going to be, making sure we capitalize on the industry standard servers, storage solutions as I talked about earlier. And again as many of you have followed TS in the past software and services have been outgrowing hardware for a number of quarters here.</p><p>Working on the customer base, how can we expand the partner networks, how can we make sure that we're building the maximum opportunity and becoming a more valuable sourcing partner for [inaudible].</p><p>In some cases it's just all in lack of good customer knowledge and walking right past opportunities because somebody goes in with a focus to say this is a IBM reseller, this is an HP reseller. Trying to make sure that we work on our own sales and practice lean methodology to not miss this type of opportunities as well as get the information and data from our customers to be able to understand them better.</p><p>Looking at complementary high growth emerging technologies. One [sub-stair] to the Access acquisition that really hasn't been highlighted as much but I've very excited about is that in addition to a big relationship with Sun there are some very exciting emerging technologies coming along with that, [inaudible] Systems, F5 Networks, Nokia are some that come to mind primarily in the security and storage solutions area. But as we learn more and more on the plans for the integration, learning more about these opportunities, and again looking to leverage them across a larger and wider partner network is very exciting to us.</p><p>And then as highlighted as part of the overall growth strategies overall in the Americas we are definitely drilling down in these particular areas and as the model works we will look in the future to look for other opportunities on a verticalized industry specific or application basis that may make sense based on again the growth profile and the total opportunities.</p><p>In EMEA again we have the FY'06 breakout by model from a percentage of revenues basis. We're looking there to be able to extend our successful relationships both on a customer and supplier basis overall. And this includes crossing over successful relationships we've had in the Americas today and trying to leverage that to global relationships and in particular over to Europe.</p><p>Within Europe we confirm work on our in-region presence -- today I'm authorized with IBM in ten countries, authorized with Hewlett-Packard in three countries today. Some of that will just be due to investment and expansion. Some of it maybe be due to some consolidation activity that occurs. I can't quantify either one of those but we're still looking to continue to work on that presence overall and Printex and Zeta deals in the last year were two examples of taking an opportunity to do that beating again supplier led strategies that created some opportunities for us.</p><p>So [inaudible] Americas we do have roughly $1.03 billion revenue in EMEA today for TS so there are some trends and opportunities within that story where the growth is showing up. I certainly highlight paralleling the Americas in IA servers and storage solutions but there may be some regional specific opportunities that are there, making sure we understand that, drilling down, getting the resource allocations properly aligned for the high growth segment.</p><p>And then the models and the things that we've created in the large servers in the Americas taking it across to EMEA, leveraging the IT either when it comes through. Again the broad acceleration of business development or comes to online tools, resources for the customers etcetera. Instead of them getting three different times around the world just leverage that intellectual capital and particularly the IT toolset as widely as possible.</p><p>In Asia-Pacific you can see 82% of this in the system builder business very heavily again dominated by a global relationship with AMD. Looking to extend relationships, successful supply relationships and again inquire about their opportunities and their plans, channel strategy for Asia-Pacific.</p><p>We are making an investment -- I'll be in China actually next week with a ribbon cutting ceremony for an integration center for us in Shenzhen, starting and servicing existing multi-national customer managed/based out of the Americas we are reaching in-region integration and presence. But it will eventually grow into hopefully a regional integration center for a distribution business in [ET]. We'll work on the sourcing strategies, line it up accordingly.</p><p>I've been talking to many of you over the last couple of years about we're looking for opportunities to get more assets invested over there. Personally I haven't had a little bigger bang announcement over that time period but this is a great start for us and you'll see some splashes of it I'm sure next week as our PR department brings attention to it.</p><p>Looking at supplier equipment and development over there. Again we have a high concentration in a couple of very key relationships today. Understanding again, connecting with the suppliers, asking them to explain what they've got for their long-term plans for channel strategy, channel partnerships, distribution plans, trying to work that into a framework that could come back to an overall strategic plan in our total business. Not just enterprise focus, we can look at the OEM segment. Again we can look at [explaining] on a systems over segment.</p><p>But we make those connections, understanding what they're up to and of course Access had no operations in Asia-Pacific today but building off of a soon-to-be-big relationship with Sun that would be another inquiry to make as far as what are their plans, what does it look like over there, and could they use our help?</p><p>And as I mentioned in EMEA obviously leveraging all the intellectual capital regarding how to run these businesses and how to create value with a value-added distribution model. Wouldn't want to try to do a one-off in Asia-Pacific anymore than I'd like to do it in EMEA.</p><p>We believe most of these you've seen in our Avnet press release and announcements regarding our pending acquisition with Access to date. Here's just the highlights overall once again -- and again if you have questions when we wrap I'd be happy to dig down to the extent that I can with any of these.</p><p>The bullet at the bottom I think [where] lies the best and we're making sure we keep in mind overall. We have set expectations that this transaction we're still expecting to close about 12/31 and some of that occurs on time it's good but again we're expecting $0.20 accretive addition to our business over time in 2007 and this business will be on at least a 12.5 ROCE for our FY'08 which will start in July. And obviously those were very key indicators and goals that affected the -- we looked at the valuation.</p><p>Overall for TS, we consider ourselves a category leader in enterprise distribution. That lead is about to get a little bigger we believe with the Access addition. Continued opportunities for global growth and more interest is being shown by some of our key suppliers and evaluating and developing that with us. Great track record again due to a great team of consistent performance. Developing value-adds and looking harder in areas of solutions and what's happening with industry standards, how it impacts our business and how we need to respond.</p><p>And with the Avnet portfolio TS has been nicely above the long-range planned target of 12.5% ROCE for at least the last couple of years now so growth has been a very, very keen emphasis for TS. All right. So the break there now maybe ask the panel to come on up and I'll take some questions on TS, so David, Pat, and Mark if you guys want to come on up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Rick, can you talk about the blade server market and the opportunities there for you guys? Because HP earlier this week at their Analyst Day they made a comment essentially that was like we'd love it if everything went to blades because we think we've got great technology there. Either talk about the relationships you've go there with vendors and so forth, and then a little bigger picture question that you've got, there's obviously been a lot of talk out there about data centers and just how much energy and heat these things consume.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And throw off even when you get down to small data clauses because you're not dealing with the really huge [installations] there but what have you guys put in place either from line-card perspective, service level offerings and so forth to kind of help the smaller and mid-size customers that you're supporting in that effort?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Sure, so blades are hot and no pun intended -- maybe pun intended after all, but we jumped on the bandwagon early with that, in particular in our partnership with IBM but we're doing the same thing with HP. Actually the gentlemen up here might be a great one to poll us on the same subject. We joined the blade[inaudible] alliance.org that IBM had sort of a steering committee kind of view on and we're trying to make sure we understand how to create solutions out of that, but at the end of the day today blade sales are actually still kind of a proprietary sale because once you choose the rack, right? And so as opposed to it being treated as a purely commodity [inaudible].</p><p>So part of what we're working with the suppliers on they fully understand the design -- they understand the value of making the initial sale and now downstream as you're going to add capacity how do you work that out, how do you model that? That's where we're working on it. But blades are certainly a part of what you saw in that IA growth segment for us and we believe again even with [centerization] it creates a growth value-add opportunity for us to live in the middle of all that ecosystem and be able to help these resellers go out to the marketplace with a complete solution on a faster basis.</p><p>They have [Ben Hamage] to figure all this out, 'who's who in a [zoo]' and which partner do I work with right? That's where the genesis of our value-creation for that is and then we'll jump off TS right now. But a great question for the panel, maybe get them to start to get through their opening. Yes, yes Brian?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: One of the key value-adds that you provide on the enterprise side is credit and financing programs so with Access being formerly part of GE to what extent were maybe they advantaged by having access to more favorable credit programs and financing vehicles under the GE Capital umbrella that maybe won't transfer to Avnet?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: You mean what Sun was giving to Access because they were part of GE?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Correct. Well that Access had available to them because they were linked with GE Capital under the GE umbrella?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Okay so funding to new [equipment]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible] by customer.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: I'll tell you Brian one of the -- so we had high expectations, and by the way there was a lot going on there. And actually we have some higher attach rates with IGF and our IBM business than Access had on the Sun business from as far as leased equipment, you want to think of it as attach rate overall. So the bottom line to your question is that we don't expect any impact or any negativity to the offering based on this transition.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Yes?</p><p>BERNIE MAHON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: You talked a lot about the different growth opportunities either by product or by region could you just talk about the margin impact there? I mean are these growth areas are they higher margins, are they lower margins? Are they different geographies, just kind of how they fit within the Tech Solutions and [garner] margins so far?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: So far and I think we've demonstrated Bernie so I'll give you a couple of the dimension. If you have another couple in mind let me know. On the dimension of proprietary to industry standard or internal architecture I think we've managed to do that pretty well. The margins are actually quite similar because again the investment necessary to go make a sale is very similar between both systems. And you can see again with that shift the operating margin has gone this way. I think we've managed through it.</p><p>From a geographic basis I'll tell you our enterprise distribution business has a little less gross margin in EMEA than it does in the Americas today. And I'm trying to make sure I understand we have an execution issue, is a secular issue overall, but from what we understand of the competitiveness of the marketplace we think that's there.</p><p>So obviously if we're going to get 30% return working capital for our total business we've got to work on our asset velocity with that European model to make sure that we're getting to that. So not a great disparity but there is a noticeable difference in the regions from an enterprise distribution point of view.</p><p>BERNIE MAHON: Okay, and what about storage how does that -- I mean just because that seems to be probably your fastest growing market?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Yes and I'm -- so I have a very small relationship but growing, for example, in Europe with Network Appliance, working on EMC. Had a relationship with StorageTek in a few countries and we're working all on that. But as far as critical mass, the critical mass [string] I can't point and say there's a big difference overall because there's a concentration of revenue in that segment is so much in the Americas today I can't look overall and say, \"Well, there's a big disparity here.\"</p><p>But I tell you from what I know of the business flow that's there on that basis the geographic gross margin comparisons are actually more equitable. They're more level than in the enterprise server space between the two major partners.</p><p>BERNIE MAHON: Okay, and then just in general how are the rebates in some of your larger, the OEMs, how are they are trending? I mean are they -- HP talks a lot about they're trying to increase the attach rate. What are you seeing from this, you know, some of your larger vendors there?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: I can just tell you the trend is to get more prescriptive and more specific about goals. Instead of just saying do $100 million this quarter and here's your deal they're getting more specific. Did you make this investment? Did you sell into this segment of the marketplace? Did you sell to this type of SMB customer? Did you sell with this ISV partnership?</p><p>So they're getting more prescriptive about it and that's probably a great question for the panel as well because they're even more prescriptive at the retailer level than I think they are at the distributor level. But the trend, is they're also and where's this money going? I'm investing tens of millions of dollars in the [material], what I'm getting for it and they're getting more prescriptive about it.</p><p>BERNIE MAHON: Okay thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey Rick thanks, just on the trend in the server business you talk about the IA servers being where the action is from a growth perspective that you just got into GE. So can you confirm that the Sun business, the GE is going to cause that i.e. to go back down again as a percentage of the total, and then what are you seeing going on at Sun that's causing you to want to jump into what's predominantly a proprietary server [vendor]?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: So I'm trying to learn how predominantly proprietary they are because from what I understand of the business one of our fastest growth segment is the Galaxy server space with the Opteron-based, right? And I think -- I think, I don't have all the dollars and cents in front of me but from a unit point of view I think that Sun, is AMD's number one OEM from a unit point of view as far as products going into server.</p><p>So I've got to real peel back on that as we go down, what I told you, what we looked at, we looked at an existing business today. We looked at it as very complementary. You know when you think about it Memec was about a $2 billion acquisition but it was a lot of -- and it was two similar companies and a lot of synergy. So we're not looking for a lot of synergies out of this deal.</p><p>This is really a bolt-on of another center of excellence if you want to call it that that when you put it through the cheese grater and took a look and looked at a lot of internal opinions on the outlook for Sun and the growth rates and what their strategic goals are and they're trying to get to 4% up margin by FY'07. And 10% in FY'09 and you'd factor all that in we came up with a path we believe that gets us to that minimally 12.5% ROCE in FY'08 and that's how we valued it.</p><p>I'd also tell you that anecdotally we believe we can work on the working capital relationship between Sun and the distributor because comparatively in our enterprise distribution model the existing one in the Americas to the one that they have with Access there's an over 2x investment of working capital per sales dollar. That gives us hope that -- we didn't bake in bringing that down as part of the deal.</p><p>What we said is we look at the total scope of opportunities and risks and said, \"Hmm, there's something we could probably work on here.\" And I think someone else commented to me this morning that Sun had mentioned around focusing on getting capital out of their supply chain as part of the strategic objectives which is music to our ears.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay and I just want to close with the same question to you that Harley got which is the current demand environment particularly in light of [Costco's] pre-announcement that just noting that their largest customer is IBM and you're the largest [player] of IBM?</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: This is our biggest quarter of the year. The seasonality is so back-end loaded that we're talking -- it's not unthinkable to do 20% of our billings the last week of December. So as I sit around December 15th and I take a look at the forecast and bottoms up, take a look at the environment. I look at the quarterly data book bill, I mean, you know we're going to need normal seasonality but I don't see any reason not to expect it at this point. All right? You [ready with] the panel, okay. I'll let -- I guess we'll go from left to right, Mark. I'll let you introduce yourselves -- are the slides queued a certain way and I'd better go that way.</p><p>MARK MELILLO, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MELILLO CONSULTING: Left again.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: All right, oh I'm sorry. I should have that up overall. Again we're welcoming these gentlemen up and I'll turn it over to Pat Edwards from Alliance Technology.</p><p>PAT EDWARDS, VP SALES AND MARKETING, ALLIANCE TECHNOLOGY GROUP: I'm going to work very hard to keep this very brief. Patrick Edwards, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Alliance Technology Group. I'm going to briefly go over who we are and I haven't touched anything. That's how brief I am, I have one slide, okay. I want to gain your attention. So everything I say is coming straight from the heart guys.</p><p>So briefly a little bit about what we do and then I think why you're here is you want to know what is Avnet doing for me, and what's the value that they bring that helps us grow our business. I'm going to go over a couple of points at the end there and I look forward to fielding some questions on the panel.</p><p>So Alliance has been around since about 1998. We're a privately-held company. We have 37 employees today. That fluctuates for our staff augmentation business unit. We're $35 million so far. We're seeing significant growth year over year. We're located in the Baltimore-Washington region and we do cover probably the mid-Atlantic area as it pertains to our commercial business. We do have also a Federal business and agency coverage takes us in different states.</p><p>We are designated as a small business. We are a woman-owned firm, also designated as an 8A certified company for Federal reasons. We are every year nationally recognized as one of the top minority, value-added resellers in the country. So what we do, we're really a professional services organization and that's the umbrella that describes who we are but if you break it down into three business units it kind of starts with the bright stick type service that we bring out to our customers. So we take care of computers, printers, servers, software, help desk support, that sort of thing. And that's on a contractual basis with our customers. It's an annuity business for us.</p><p>Also have a second business unit under there is staff augmentation, technical staff augmentation. So we'll put a network engineer, we'll put a SAN specialist, fiber [inaudible] specialist out on site and it may be temporary, it may be permanent. So those two business units are a very good annuity product for us and we've been doing that since our inception.</p><p>Data management is our third business unit and that's the meat and potatoes of why we're here today because that's really where Avnet steps in and really differentiates. That's also the largest percentage of our business and that breaks down, or it's not limited to, but mostly Sun Microsystems. We're a legacy StorageTek partner for most of our experience that we bring to the table for Sun has been our StorageTek storage line, Network Appliance, and Symantec. So we're into the data management. We're into the data security.</p><p>We take a consultative approach to our clients. We can't really wear a badge as we walk in the door that says net [inaudible] to [ManTech] or Sun or what have you. We like to talk to clients about what their challenges are and how can we help those meet those challenges. We'll talk about name brand stuff later but right now let's figure out how we can increase your efficiency of managing your data.</p><p>There's exponential growth in data today. You all know and customers have to do a lot more with a lot less. The budgets are shrinking and the data is growing and it has to be protected, secured, protected, stored, and there's all kinds of things that are driving data management needs and so that's kind of where we're wrapping that business unit around and that's where most of our business is in the marketplace today.</p><p>So we find ourselves in a unique situation because not only does someone like an Alliance have to bring a value proposition to our end user and to our clients, but we also have to bring a value proposition to our manufacturers. You see we have to represent their line as good if not better than them. They're kind of hiring us in a way via Avnet. So we have to go upstream and say hey Net App, hey Sun, hey Symantec, we're trained. We're certified. We know your stuff really good. We're representing you well.</p><p>We have to go down to our clients and say it doesn't matter about name brand, it's take our experience with pipelines that we represent, our bench of engineers and let's really bring to bear a solution that's going to help you meet your needs. So to conclude I have specific things, services, products etcetera that Avnet brings to Alliance, someone like Alliance. Specifically us, is they have, I'll start with R2O. R2O is quoting source, an automated quoting source.</p><p>So what may not sound too big a deal but let me remind you I don't have to invest personally into an inside sales team to take care of quoting from an outside source. I go to Avnet under SLA and I get my quote back in a four hour or less time and it's guaranteed for accuracy and it's guaranteed for my cost protection even if something happened at their end they hold us true.</p><p>They also have another tool [Smart Tracking] so tying into leads where we have to bring part of that value to the manufacturers not only to represent their products well. We have to bring them opportunity. We have to go out and say, \"Hey look Sun we are not only good at representing your line but we're out hunting for you and we're finding customers that need the Sun logo on their floor.\"</p><p>And we have to bring that value to them and with some of the programs that Avnet brings through their marketing lead generation back into a lead tracking tool. So we know when leads come in. We update them and we can provide up-to-date quality information back to our manufacturer reps.</p><p>Avnet has invested in a multi-million dollar lab called [IT Demo Central] and again this is an infrastructure cost that I don't have to bear. Avnet has taken this lab, hard equipment, networking gear, and dedicated engineering resources and from a partner community we're allowed or able to reconfigure any solution that we'd like based off of what they have available. And we can call ahead, have them set up a solution and now we can present to our customers via Web link show them the feature functionalities of products whether it be hardware, servers or software. That's a tremendous value to us.</p><p>Training assistance, you know, I talked about representing manufacturer lines as well if not better. We have to take some investment and training on the partner side. Avnet has assistance there where they literally will help us get certified in product lines or bring engineers in to give us a supplemental training so that we can go through our certification processes, we're ahead of the game.</p><p>And I'm going to close with credit. We mentioned credit recently and I think in a quality distribution partner they see the value of you growing. Ultimately if we grow, they grow. If we're making money, they're making money. In order to do that we have to have a credit line in order to hold a lot of opportunity, a lot of POs that come in. Just getting the order isn't the end game. We have to be able to finance it. We have to be able to present leasing options. We have to be able to hold the cost of money and extend the terms out to our end user community.</p><p>We hit a ceiling a few years ago with another distributor and we couldn't grow our business. We shifted gears. We went over to Avnet and our business grew exponentially starting from that year. When we started with Avnet our relationship about five years ago we were able a $4 million storage line. And today our storage line is in excess of 21 million, 22 million.</p><p>So it's been a big significant difference for us and at the end of the day we have to present a unified front to our end user. The end user doesn't care really where your engineer is coming from, where the lab resides, who really built the lab. They want their needs met and they want it in a cost-effective way and Avnet standing behind us makes us a much stronger partner to represent to our end users. So I look forward to fielding any questions on the panel. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Thank you, Pat. Mark, you're up.</p><p>MARK MELILLO: All right, thanks. Good morning. To go through a few things about our company and we'll talk about the Avnet relationship. I think moved over to Avnet [Clanaro] in the late '90s, maybe '97/'98 if my memory serves me right. We did it greatly around the credit issue as well at the time. We were growing very rapidly in the '90s.</p><p>The banks were looking sort of soured on the technology market as it got to the end and we were getting tightened credit so we were really looking for a partner there who could let us grow really infinitely, and Avnet stepped up to the table and provided that. So we're actually ending up our 19th year of business. We're been recognized in a number of things from the VAR 500 to Deloitte &amp; Touche, Fast, the Fast 500 as well as a number of technical awards.</p><p>Just a little bit of the company kind of an overview of where we are. At the bottom here provides like the really critical technical services that we provide. We are basically a small footprint of a large integrator. I mean that's the best way to describe what we do. We offer a variety of services for the data center infrastructure but we're about 90 people actually located heavily from Boston to DC and then we now have representation around the country which is an expansion we've done in our last year to 15 months. So we're trying to roll out nationally. Avnet has also partnered with us in that venture as we try to roll things out and continue to expand what we do.</p><p>So I think that the best way to look at our business is we really start up management consulting. We've hired a few years back an ex-CIO to build a management consulting business for us. That allows us to get upstream with the customer, get in very early before technology is chosen. We represent actually all the major brands so we're a little different in that respect. HP is our biggest business.</p><p>It accounts for about 60% of our product business but we carry IBM, we carry Sun, we carry EMC, etcetera, etcetera. We buy most of that through Avnet. And with EMC and IBM being our chief, fastest growing businesses unfortunately we've missed the great wave that some of the IBM resellers have gone through over the last three years. I notice when I show up at the VAR 500 the fastest growing ones in the last two or three years have all been IBM VARs.</p><p>So they've taken advantage of that. Didn't know that 25% or 30% of business came in, in the last month, but anyway --. A different model there. So we have our management consulting group, really a data center solutions group and then our engineering, our core low-level services that we provide.</p><p>And one of the things that we're really big into is IT service management, that polls -- [IT] polls' the buzz word out there and we've trained up a ton of people, I think we have 28 [ITO] service IP people in the organization from sales management right through sales people, technical people. So our whole approach to a customer is about service management. We really want to get in early, talk to a customer about their problems, as Pat talked about. And then get into product decisions as we move forward.</p><p>And here are some of the specific things that come out of that, virtualization and data center consolidation and tech refreshes and so on, lights out operation, that's a big thing for us. We're actually one of HPs largest open view partners. We're one of the top-three in the country, they have an elite-2 status, there's only three partners.</p><p>And so we really deal with not only building your infrastructure, but managing it and that's really a big value add for us. In our -- to give you lights out operations from the data center's standpoint. With that by the way, within the last year, year and a half we now provide a managed services offering there. We do first level support for our customers so our customers call us as opposed to calling HP when they have open view related issues.</p><p>Since we're doing the customization of that environment we actually know more about it, we keep more information in our data base, our knowledge base, about their environment. So calling HP you're likely to get a question of, \"Okay, what do you mean the software is not working, what did you do?\" this and that. You call us, we have an engineer whose looking at the actual design that we put in place and can answer your questions a lot quicker.</p><p>So we -- HPs been pushing that out to the channel and that's really been our entry into the managed services business. We also have a desk top managed services group. One of the things I talked about, the whole area of management consulting has been big for us. Risk and compliance management for customers again, getting us upstream, getting us in early. Our real goal is to get to the CIO and their direct reports. That's where we spend most of our time, not so much at the procurement level.</p><p>Obviously we have to cover that too. We're really focused at that and where this relates back to [inaudible] and you talked about the health care initiative that's going on. We're looking more and more to our distributor to help us get into markets, to put programs together for markets, so that's expensive for us, a lot of SG&amp;A involved for us to cradle that.</p><p>We actually historically have created all of that ourselves. And as we've tried to lower our SG&amp;A we really look to Avnet to do more of that. To do more of the coding and configuration that we have typically done. And to really reduce costs there, but also on the marketing side to get us into new initiatives, maybe put new partnerships together that are hard for us to manage ourselves just because they are new, they're not big enough etcetera, so that's been a big area.</p><p>And this is just a little bit about the types of things we do in the compliance remediation space. It's been a very strong business for us. It's just a good leader for us to get into an account. I talked about IP service management before. We've been given a number of awards on the open [G] side for technical excellence as well as volume sales and so on. We we're Avnet's top HP software partner, this past two years.</p><p>Identity management is a real growing area. If you are going to do management of your IT infrastructure, really understanding all of your user base, the whole IT concept, for those of you that are the single sign on type things. This is like a whole new level with identity management, absolutely necessary for rolling out an infrastructure.</p><p>We do have staff [aug] business, it's a very small piece of our business, we're more of project shop but we do have staff aug business. One of the things that we push is the real value added we have a whole collaborative environment we use with our customers, that's online. So when we're doing a project for you, you actually get to see live updates and the project management charts and whatnot.</p><p>And our customers love this because it's basically a collaboration. We can control what they see, so they might not see everything but they see enough that they don't have to wait for a project manager to call them and say, \"By the way I've updated the EM chart and this is what it looks like.\" Or -- they can go in and say, \"What do you mean, something's been delayed, or this has happened, or that didn't take place?\"</p><p>As I mentioned this is a smattering of the products that we offer so we provide a wide range of platforms and something that we really claim is the circle of excellence. It's really a concept that we've driven home the last four or five years and that is the customer at the center. Our people -- the right people, the right partners and the right solutions. And the partners can be HP, Sun, but in essence a partner is also Avnet in that environment. To really provide the right solutions to our customers. Thank you.</p><p>DAVID TRAXLER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, VSS, INC.: Good morning. My name is David Traxler and I'm from Mississippi so if I talk too fast I'll slow down. I guess I would start off by saying before we do anything else is that when we first were introduced to Avnet we were a $32 million company. The good Lord willing we will hit our number which by the way 38% of it will come in the month of December, but we should do 90 to $92 million this year.</p><p>There's really 15 days left so we'll see how that works out. But we were comparing notes last night and I look back over the last three to four years and anywhere from 20 -- it's a low from 26% to a high of 38% of our business does come in the fourth quarter, actually in December, so that's quite interesting.</p><p>And back to the point or the question was asked about Blades a few moments ago. We certainly have ridden the wave with the IBM Blades technology, it's been great. And everybody jumped on the consolidation and virtualization band wagon. But what's coming now, is specialized blades where you have different OSs that are running on different blades and that's going to be exciting for us, so that's just to that point.</p><p>A little bit about VSS, just a few fast facts. We've been in business 15 years. We have offices really up and down the East Coast and you'll see a little spattering of that in a minute from a map. We have had significant growth. We have been recognized as the second-largest Avnet partner for the last few years. Really recognized and sort of in the top ten of the top IBM Blade [Rev] partners. And last year we were ranked as the 267th ranked in 4 or 500 and also one the Editor's Choice Award from the VAR 500.</p><p>We have different partner alliances, if you will, with different ISVs as you see here on the chart. SAP, Microsoft, some HA solutions from Lakeview, Memec, you might of heard of those. Last year we hit revenues of 82 million, 82.5 to be exact. We should do 90 to 92 million this year, as I said earlier. And what we are forecasting for '07 is going to be a 12% growth. That's a little bit below what we have had happen to us in the past but as you get larger it's a little bit more difficult to get those 30% numbers. But we've been very, very fortunate to maintain that type of growth.</p><p>Another interesting point that is very difficult in our business, new customer acquisitions is very, very difficult. And if you think about it just in this note, over the last few years, and I'll go all the way back to 2004, in 2004 we had 50 -- around 56 customers that were brand new, net new customers to VSS. Less than half of those customers bought hardware or product from us.</p><p>So that was a service or software product or solution that we sold to those customers. Now I assure you that those -- half of those 56 customers that we didn't sell a hardware component to, we were all over them as time goes on. But you develop that relationship from the solution or service perspective.</p><p>And in 2005 we had 147 net new customers and in 2006 -- well that was in 2005 and in 2004 it was 147 and it was 2003, Q3, that it was 50, 56, so 53 to 56. But the new customer acquisition rates that we have been growing at has really been impressive. When you think about on an average we're doing business of about 5 to 600 customers during the course of the year and 100 to 140 of those are net new customers, net new to VSS.</p><p>Some of the things that Avnet and IBM tracked, at least in our space, is, the amount of competitive wins that we have. And this might be against some of my new friends that I met last night, it would be against EMC, HP, Sun etcetera. But we did, in '05, $18 million of competitive winbacks that they were actually able to track for us. Currently our staffing is right at 100. I said last night it's plus or minus, it depends on whose onboard today but we're running right around 100. We carry about 250 self certifications.</p><p>We were talking about last night about how much the stringent requirements it takes to be an IBM business partner or a Sun partner or an HP partner. The investment that you have to make around people and certifications just continues to grow. I personally don't think that's a bad thing because that increases our quality that we had with our customers. But it is a growing expense and a growing challenge that we all have. Even a company like us, with all the different brands that we carry it is a challenge every year to maintain those certifications.</p><p>This chart is a little bit off because I would tell you that when we put this chart together, I guess as soon as you put it together it's obsolete, our initial forecast for the year was going to be less than $90 million. But the way the month of December has turned around for us it looks like well -- like I said we'll be around 90 to 96, somewhere in that range. And if we hit that target we will probably break 100 in '07 that would be our goals. Which would be a big deal for us.</p><p>This chart actually tells the story about VSS. Everything we do -- there is -- I would say four years ago, four or five years ago when we would ship out product it might be that we would ship out resources that would go with it. It's rare today. It's rare today that we ship out product and we don't ship resources with it, very, very rare. Whether that's our direct resource or if it's Avnet or if its IBM, but someone is going with it. That's just the nature of the business that we have.</p><p>A couple of areas that we really invested in, in the last 12 months is our SAP and our Microsoft dynamic [extracted]. And some might find that a little unusual but in the SMB space more and more of the product is being purchased through a solution, through a bundling or a packaged solution. And you -- I'm sure you all get this data from Gartner and IBC, and there certainly are trends that have been pointing to more solution oriented purchasing by our customers versus point products purchasing by our customers.</p><p>And so we had an opportunity and we're a little opportunistic in that particular vein, but we had an opportunity to bring some people on board and building their skills in that area. And those two areas have really turned around for us, in one calendar year.</p><p>So we're not trying to compete with a [Censure] or IBM, maybe in the second-tier of the [inaudible] but in very niche environments, where we have relationships, we're able, we're actually building out an SAP practice which is implementation and we actually resell the product in the SMB space. Because you know, they are all racing, those particular vendors we believe, are racing to create a channel to fight for the SMB market place. And so we have aligned ourselves with SAP and Microsoft in this area.</p><p>Geographically we are an Eastern United States company. You can see that this shows how we pick up what we call the \"Boot\". But our offices and people are from New York all the way down to in Florida and over to Mississippi. No rhyme or reason about Mississippi, it's where I grew up and so that's where we started the company. But the majority of our business, interestingly enough, the majority by a long shot is actually in the mid-Atlantic area so we have a significant presence in New York and obviously in the Southeast. Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you David. I think [inaudible] will raise your questions at this point. Again, there were a couple of topics on Blades and rebates you might want to [start]. In fact, maybe I would ask them to sit down and -- David, you made some comments on Blades already, I don't know if Pat or Mark if you want to jump in on the Blades or rebates questions that started --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What was the rebate --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It's just that we were just happening with the --. Yes, and my comment was they're getting more prescriptive, but is there any other trends in the rebates either regarding the quality, quantity, things along those lines of -- or whoever had the question that -- Bernie, you want to --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So the question was just on the rebates, what of the major OEMs, how are they changing over the last year? Are they giving you more opportunities for rebates, because if you talk to an HP or the other -- well, specifically HP, they're trying to improve the attach rate. You know, I've got no storage, along with notebooks or whatever. So can you just talk about the different trends with the major OEMs?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I'll chime in on that. The rebates are definitely changing. We've looked at ours year-over-year and our rebates did grow fairly significantly. HP had somewhat of a complicated formula for doing it and some of you may have seen my comments in the VAR business a couple of months ago, really kind of hammering them for that.</p><p>John Thompson has moved on and they're going to be replacing him. It was done with a spreadsheet I think and not with a real thought as to how it's going to happen at the street level. And they're trying to get prescriptive in terms of the portfolio mix that they want. But the formulas were so complicated that at the street level you really couldn't affect sales behavior because you couldn't predict what you were going to get. So what's the difference. It's kind of like, well tell me in the end whether I did good or bad.</p><p>And so that program is changing and they're simplifying it but more and more money is coming in on the backend. Even on the OpenView software side, we've done some deals this year where we had to almost change our sales compensation model because it was so backend driven that I felt like I was selling cars, there's no cost up front but -- our costs up front, but I was making a lot of money on the backend. So it is becoming -- they want to control more of the stream so they're moving more to the backend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So just in general, if you look at your growth margins, say your product mix stays the same would you expect your gross margins to improve because there is more money available through these rebates or would you think they would stay flat or --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: For us they've stayed relatively flat, maybe up a little. It seems like they're taking a little away on the front end and providing more on the back end where they can control who they give it to. In the end I would have probably done a little bit better overall margins, what I can tell.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Lou Miscioscia Cowen &amp; Company. I guess my question is for Mark. You had a chart that you put up that showed a whole bunch of different things that I guess you all were working on. Can you maybe mention the one, two or three things that are most popular with customers right now? And then I guess I have a follow-up question to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: David mentioned that the SAP business was strong for him. He was actually building out a SAP practice. We haven't done that, we have partnered up but we have an SAP infrastructure capability that is sort of unique. A real knowledge of that environment and that's been fueling a lot of growth, the whole ERP space has been significant for us. So I would say that is a -- that has been over the last couple of years and continues to be a catalyst for some growth for us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: One of the topics that you had had was virtualization. And I'm curious if that has really taken off because that could theoretically could be something that could lower server unit demand if you were running a 15, 20% utilization of servers now, you're drawing virtualization open, you have a whole bunch of extra capacity. And I think that IDC numbers for server growth, from a revenue standpoint, are very, very low single-digits, I think because of that reason. Just wondering if you are seeing that trend right now?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's very prevalent across -- everyone that maybe views the prediction as to what you think server demand will be in the next several years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know what it will be maybe these guys have a little better crystal ball. But, yes, it's low. I mean the good news has been storage has more than made up for it and I think these gentlemen have seen the same thing so we're much more storage centric as an entity than we are server centric in terms of our selling approach, for that reason, storage and software really.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll add to that actually. You know that's the reason why we went down a storage route earlier on, data growth, big storage needs. Interesting though, our business which was our flagship which was Storage Tech, in that storage division line, we're now Sun. And so the solution sell, meaning processor all the way back to archiving and data, our deals are growing because it's a broader solution that we're bringing to our customer so --.</p><p>But the margins definitely are lean in the processor side, at least from my standpoint. And rebates do help, and to add on to a comment there, I am also seeing flat. It's just a kind of -- it's getting leaner up front, they're making up for it a little bit on the back. So, flat to upside if you do more volume.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: The only thing I would differ with that comment, just in terms of margins, on the BCS side of HPs business the margins are so great it's just the BCS business as a whole is dropping. They're doing more blades and related which are obviously much lower business or lower margins. But the BCS, the traditional Unix servers are still pretty lucrative to sell, where you can find a market.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two questions, first one for any of the panelists. Can you talk about open versus closed distribution and whether you think a closed distribution model still makes sense? Do you expect that to continue over the next two to three years or are vendors thinking about opening distributions to other competitors? And if they did how would that change your sourcing strategy, is my first question?</p><p>And my second question is for David, consolidation starting to pick up. We saw CDW acquire Berbee which may have some impact on your business, what are your thoughts on that acquisition and how are the vendors responding to it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Why don't you start with the second one first David?</p><p>DAVID TRAXLER: I would say VSS was acquired in May by a holding company. Very similar to what they're place with [Sirius] would be an illustration. I do see a lot of activity. I hear a lot more talk than I see action, if you will or transactions taking place. I think there is going to be some more consolidation. I don't think, at least today, I don't see how the CDW acquisition or the Sirius acquisition is going to affect us.</p><p>There is some discussion being kicked around, and this is where in my opinion Avnet really plays a huge role in the future and that is, it's sort of what's the VAR of the future going to look like? And there are a lot of companies out there that work together where if you think about it for a second if Avnet has several thousand VARs or what --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, a couple of thousand, two thousand I would say.</p><p>DAVID TRAXLER: A couple of thousand VARs, how do you take the key or the leading VARs in a particular area, whether it be in the IBM channel or whatever, and mobilize them to really almost present themselves as a virtual organization. I've got counterparts on the West coast, that we've got solutions that they don't have, they have solutions that we don't have and we work together today, a little bit disjointed. But if we were integrated at all levels which this goes back really to Rick's presentation, if we were tightly integrated at all levels we could almost appear as one provider to the customer, to the customer base if you will. But yes, they will be individual companies.</p><p>That's a sidebar comment and sort of a soapbox of mine, personally, but I think that there is going to be more acquisitions, there are a lot of people talking about it. I think also there is a perception there might be a perception issue of the value out there. There are a lot of small partners out there that think they are worth a lot more than they probably really are. They have a small customer mix, very high concentration of customers and a very high concentration of sales people generating that revenue and I think that paints a little bit of a risk story from a channel perspective. I don't know if that's inappropriate to say, but that's just my opinion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Open versus closed, Pat, Mark?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, open versus closed, that's an interesting question. I don't know what's going to happen. I would suspect that it's going to remain closed. From my standpoint it may be odd for me to respond this way but I would like to see it stay that way. There is an investment made between the distributor and the partner community. And if you open this thing up and I can chose multiple people to buy the same product from or change any time that I want, I think that we diminish that investment between the CDP and the partner.</p><p>So I would lose I think, ultimately. Maybe earlier on I might be able to squeeze a couple of points out of each one until I get to make a couple of more dollars. But I think that what I stated earlier, people like Avnet are making investments in the tools that help us represent stronger. And I would like to see that trend continue.</p><p>DAVID TRAXLER: On that point I think from an IBM perspective, and I can only speak to the IBM side, is that as a channel we want to -- we want to meet the IBM and Avnet's growth requirements. I mean it's sort of incumbent upon us I think and I'm a member of a couple of councils on the IBM side, and we've sort of accepted the responsibility because we want to know. We want to know what is the growth that IBM needs to see out of the channel.</p><p>And the group that I'm referring is probably the old [inaudible] role that we all live with in many different aspects of business but we're taking the responsibility of making sure we communicate to IBM what our attack plans and what our strategies around attacking the SMB space because they certainly have an initiative in that area. We also are taking really the responsibility on ourselves to make sure we understand what their goals are and objectives are because we want them to be confident, number one that we're going to hit those targets because they count on -- the count on the channel.</p><p>And so at least from my perspective part of the answer to that question is for the companies like us, all of sitting at this table as a group collectively to take some responsibility in helping the Avnet and IBMs of the world and hit that sustained growth because they're putting some trust in us and we need to step up to it. And I think just recently within the IBM councils I mean we are taking more responsibility today than I've seen us take as a community, if you will, in probably -- well since I've been on the council so I think that's positive thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: The comment I'd add about Open Source I think where there's inventory Open Source has a place. Because largely the only time you really need to go somewhere else is because somebody is not carrying -- doesn't have the product in their warehouse but since most of what we buy isn't really inventory any more. I mean that was what it was when the days when we started. But I think it's more of a partnering game and Open Source really isn't of benefit.</p><p>I think again to some extent the larger resellers would probably, as these gentlemen said, we're more into the partnering type of thing and we want to have co-investment and what-not around how we're going to grow our business. Maybe the smaller partners would like Open Sourcing where they don't have the leverage or the negotiation but I'd rather sit down. I mean ours comes up I think in three or four months and we'd like a three-year deal.</p><p>I don't really like to be playing with my distributors. It doesn't create me a lot of money to sit around and negotiate with my distributors. So I like to do it every couple of years. Put a plan together, invest in it and go out and capture customers and not have to worry about whether my credit is going to be too tight, and whether I'm getting the best deal or not the best deal. And it's just too hard I think to run a business like that.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: Anyone else? I think there, Ed? Okay if not we'll just say thank you to the panel. We appreciate it. And I'll move on I think to Mr. Sadowski.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI, SVP, CFO, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, AVNET INC.: Okay good afternoon everyone. I think it's just about afternoon I guess. We're running a little bit ahead of schedule. I've got to cover essentially three things. One is just about a little history about Avnet financial results over the past five or six years or so and then talk a little bit about the change in our business resulting from our VBM initiatives as it relates to working capital usage and cash flow generation. And then I'll close out with an update on our long-term business model.</p><p>So first just looking at the results over the past few years starting off with revenues. We did hit record revenues in our fiscal year '06 timeframe with revenue growing quite significantly primarily due to the Memec acquisition. As you can see at the upper right-hand side there organic growth came in at about 7.6% so if you back out or if you include Memec's results in the prior-year period and you adjust for some of the divestitures that we made we get to organic growth about 7.6%. So pretty steady growth and again record levels of sales in our most recent fiscal year.</p><p>One of the important things that impacts our business is business mix. And business mix between the two business groups, Technology Solutions and Electronics Marketing, as well as a regional mix of business. This is very, very key because it impacts a number of key financial metrics that you basically see when you at Avnet's overall financial results being gross margin, operating income margin, and working capital velocity.</p><p>As Ray mentioned earlier and I think Rick mentioned it as well we drive all of our businesses to consistent levels of returns on working capital and return on total capital employed. But what that looks like at the Avnet level is going to be different based upon business mix. I think many of you are familiar with business mix issues but just to summarize if you look at our Electronics Marketing business in Asia, as well as our Technology Solutions business overall they tend to have lower margins in Electronics Marketing in the Americas and Electronics Marketing in EMEA but they have significantly higher asset velocity.</p><p>So that dynamic is key when you look at a chart like this here, and you can see that over the last few years the percentage of business between TS and EM has changed quite a bit up and down and you can see from a regional perspective the business has clearly shifted more towards Asia which again has an impact on Avnet's margins.</p><p>If you look at the far right-hand side we've just thrown in pro forma what Avnet had looked like in fiscal year 2006. If you add roughly $2 billion of sales that we expect to come over with the acquisition of Access. And you can see that Technology Solutions grows back to 43% of our business overall, and TS declined -- I'm sorry, EM declines about 57%. And again that will have a pretty big impact on our operating margin, working capital velocity and those metrics that I mentioned early.</p><p>If you look at gross margins over the last five or six years you can see right after the bubble burst in the late 2001 and 2002 timeframe our margins overall came down rather dramatically. But since that period of time they've been pretty steady and really being impacted more so by mix of business that I just mentioned as opposed to other things that may impact margin.</p><p>Certainly there is margin pressure overall but in the most recent couple of quarters as an example our Electronics Marketing Group actually maintained and in some regions improved margin. So overall the biggest driver that is going to impact, that has impacted Avnet's margins most recently and what we expect will impact Avnet gross margins going forward is going to be that mix issue that I spoke about earlier as opposed to any other single item.</p><p>Operational excellence, Rick eluded to this earlier, obviously very, very key from our perspective. We need to continue to drive efficiencies in our business and as you can see on this slide here we've done a very, very good job, the team has done really from my perspective a great job in managing expenses and bringing our expense to GP which is a key metric that we use to measure operational excellence driving it down to 73% for the fiscal year '06 timeframe.</p><p>If you extend it out a few quarters in Q1 and Q2 the number is about 69% of sales, of GP, excuse me, and so continuing driving that. Our expectation is that as we move towards fulfilling our overall long-term business model we'll drop expense to GP to below 65%.</p><p>So when you take operating margin, growth in sales, and operational excellence you obviously get to operating income and operating income margin. And you can see here since the 2002 timeframe when we hit the low point from our earnings history we've grown operating income dollars and operating income margin quite significantly closing out fiscal year '06 at 3.5% margin and over $500 million in operating income dollars. So again, pretty steady and proven overall and we do expect that those numbers will continue moving up in the right direction over the next couple of years as we look to fulfill what our long-term business goals are.</p><p>And one of the important things to note as you look at some of these slides, the performance has been pretty good, all of our business units. So this is not one area of the business just out-performing. Obviously you're very positively impacted from the expense perspective and operating income margin perspective with the acquisition of Memec but if you kind of back away from that a little bit even the balance of the business group and including TS as well obviously have performed across the regions across both business groups very, very well from a profitability perspective.</p><p>If you then factor in the impact of interest expense which you don't see here -- I'll go through that a little bit later -- below the operating income line you can see again significant improvement in net income dollars and earnings per share as well. I mean you essentially hit record net income dollars in our fiscal year '06 timeframe. The additional shares that we issued in connection with the acquisition of Memec did not quite hit record levels of earnings per share.</p><p>I'll point out just one correction in the book that you have, I think the book you have has earnings per share in 2006 of $1.96. That was excluding stock compensation costs, all of these charts here include stock compensation so if you back that in or put that back in I should say it reduces EPS to $1.87. The $275 million of net income that's in your book is correct and it does include stock compensation. But as footnoted down there would exclude some of the restructuring charges that we've taken over the years including most recently in connection with the acquisition of Memec.</p><p>A key part of our VBM initiative is working capital management and as you can see here working capital management has improved rather significantly again over the last few years, the red line basically indicating inventory turns, growing up very nicely, and these numbers obviously are impacted by the mix of business that I mentioned earlier. But if we go below that level so to speak within the two business groups and within the regions we've had fairly consistent improvement in working capital velocity across the board.</p><p>EM most recently had record levels of inventory velocity as an example or inventory turns and working capital velocity as well. The blue bars here representing just working capital as of the end of the quarter, or the end of the year, I should end of the period of time. And you can see that moving down quite significantly over the last few years again being driven primarily by the value-based management initiatives put into place within the organization and driving the higher levels of return on capital.</p><p>So if you look at the impact of turns and earns so our increase in operating margins as well as our improvement in working capital velocity you get to the various return on capital metrics. And you can see here that we are moving up very, very nicely towards our long-term goals which we hope to hit in the next, I'll say year or so at this point in time.</p><p>But 22.4%, we actually did -- obviously did better than that as we closed out the fiscal year in the fourth quarter both from a return on working capital and a return of capital perspective. And these numbers here represent the annual numbers. So again pretty steady improvement and our expectation is that those numbers will continue to move up and to the right as we continue down the path of achieving our long-term financial goals.</p><p>What I'm going to cover now in the next couple of slides is just taking a look at how, not only the change in the structure of the industry that Roy talked about earlier today, but equally if not more importantly the focus that the organization has had on value-based management and how we've managed working capital. So some of these slides if you're looking at it look a little bit confusing so we'll go through this in a kind of build methodology.</p><p>If you look here the blue bars essentially represent levels of working capital and the red line represents averaging working capital as a percent of sales. And you can see quite vividly in the 2001 timeframe leading up to the -- to the high end of the cycle we grew inventory, we grew working capital quite significantly and had a pretty big impact on our overall balance sheet as business grew. And then as you can see business obviously fell off a little bit and we reduced working capital pretty significantly.</p><p>One of the other things that impact working capital growth was certainly a lot of acquisition activity a lot of which took place around the same time. So when you take into account acquisitions like [Eurtronics], Savoir, VEBA, and Marshall, working capital grew quite a bit as well. And then as you can see as working capital started to fall off a little bit as sales started to decline relatively quickly as the bubble burst so to speak we hit high levels of working capital as a percentage of sales. We actually peaked out at about 32% so that compares with what the norm had been up to that point in time to roughly about 25% working capital as a percentage of sales.</p><p>As you look at this trend line this is what's happened as a result of our VBM initiatives, ongoing programs that constantly look at ways of being able to manage our assets more effectively. You can see that essentially what we've done is moved working capital, average working capital as a percentage of sales down from what had been normal levels of let's say 25% down to the 15 to 18%. So pretty significant movement and improvement overall in the way we've managed our assets which is depicted on this particular slide here.</p><p>And one other way to take a look at this is we did hit record levels of sales as we mentioned earlier, $14 billion. If you compare that back to the prior peak of $12 billion what this is depicting that we've increased our sales by $2 billion and yet at the same time reduced the amount of money we've invested in working capital by $1 billion. Obviously a significant impact overall on our return to capital and working capital velocity metrics again being driven significantly by the value-based management initiatives within our business.</p><p>Translating down a little bit into cash flow, so obviously as I think we all know that in our business cash flow is driven by two things primarily, profitability and our investments in working capital. And again when we define working capital, it's inventory, receivables, less accounts payable.</p><p>And as you can see here this chart here in the blue bars represents change in working capital as opposed to absolute working capital dollars and you can see that during the 2001 timeframe investments in working capital as I mentioned earlier as the business grew and this -- one other thing I'll point out before I go a little further is trailing 12-month organic free cash flow.</p><p>What we've attempted to do here and I think it's pretty accurate, it's a lot of work that Vince and the team did to come up with these numbers is essentially look at free cash flow excluding acquisitions and trying to back away some of the unusual cash that we would have used in connection with acquisitions and restructuring. So to get what is real cash flow from what we call an organic perspective.</p><p>And as you can see here trailing 12-month cash flow started to move up rather rapidly with the downturn again part of the counter-cyclicality of our balance sheet so we generated significant amounts of cash as we reduced our working capital as business started to decline. And so you can see it just basically reemphasizes the counter-cyclical nature of our business overall.</p><p>Since that period of time what's happened is through again VBM as well as structural changes in the industry our working capital is now, I guess, less counter-cyclical I guess is the best way to put it than it has been in prior periods of time as we become more efficient not only at Avnet but within the industry as well in managing working capital.</p><p>Okay and so if you look -- this may have jumped a little bit too far ahead, okay, again looking at cash flow generation you can see that as business -- that's too fast, backing away too fast for me here. Okay, as you can see here it goes back again from the technology bubble what happened after that and what's currently in the mix. You can see that total free cash flow declined, again organic free cash flow declined rather significantly as business grew in 2000 and 2001 timeframe.</p><p>Then we had the essentially two years of a downturn where working capital as -- basically our growth of business declined rather significantly and therefore due to the counter-cyclicality of the business that I just mentioned we managed to grow quite significantly organic cash flow as working capital essentially declined pretty significantly.</p><p>And then you can see as we move a little bit closer 2004/2005 timeframe we have the mid-cycle correction which impacted the business and one of the important things to note and this is really where the change comes into play is even though we had a fair amount of growth during that particular period of time essentially 20% growth, 2004 as we rebounded from the down cycle.</p><p>Free cash flow never went negative. That's something that in the past that 20% growth or thereabout we certainly would have had negative free cash flow but we believe the way we've changed our business and the way we manage the business as well as the structural changes in the industry overall that on a go-forward basis we should be able to manage cash flow in a different type of environment essentially being as low as growth phase reasonably modest which is what we expect it to be we should be able to fund our business through internally generated cash flow as opposed to going out and having to borrow huge sums of money.</p><p>So again pretty large structural changes in our business that will impact us quite nicely on a go-forward basis relative to cash flow generation. So all of that cash what do we do with it? We used a lot of money to pay down debt rather significantly and as a result have strengthened our balance sheet as you can see here. So debt is coming down rather significantly since the peak back in 2001 to where we are today, and interest expense coming down as well, interest expense coming down rather dramatically overall. And you could see down at the bottom the impact on our credit statistics, if you go back to the 2002 timeframe, not exactly stellar credit statistics.</p><p>Disappointing in many, many respects but the growth that's occurred over the four years after that is a pretty healthy improvement overall, and from our perspective basically at investment grade but we'll talk credit statistics. We're not quite there from all of the rating agencies yet but we think we'll get there and we're fairly confident that we'll get there pretty quickly as we improve on some of these numbers and continue to improve our overall credit statistics as we manage the business to one of our strategic objectives which is to be an investment grade company.</p><p>I don't want to be a high investment grade company. We don't think that's appropriate for our business, but we would like to be an investment grade company at the lower level on a long-term basis. So, some of the recent financing activity that has taken place, which many of you may be familiar with, we've done quite a bit over the last six months or so.</p><p>Some of the highlights, number one being the impact of improved results at the credit rating agencies where S&amp;P, who has us at investment grade right now, basically took us off a negative outlook and moved us to stable. And Moody's upgraded as well, not quite to investment grade yet, but we're working on that.</p><p>Debt to capital, down to 30.4%, we do expect that that number will rise with the acquisition of Access, which we do plan on funding with essentially debt, so that will move that number up. We did issue some new ten-year notes recently, and used the proceeds there to pay down some of our high coupon debt that, unfortunately, we had to take out, oh about four or five years ago, which had obviously a very high interest rate associated with them. And then, we've used our liquidity to pay off on notes that came due in the November timeframe, so a lot of refinancing activity that took place, which essentially has reduced our interest expense pretty significantly.</p><p>Prior to any cash that we would use for the Access acquisition, if you look at our expected interest expense in the second half of fiscal '07 as compared with the second half of fiscal '06, we're expecting about a $20 million decline in net interest expense.</p><p>One of the other things that's occurred over the last few years is changing our debt maturity profile, so as you can see here in 2002, we had about $1.6 billion of debt, and our blended interest rate at that time was about 6%. Since then, we've pulled interest -- pulled debt down to about $1.2 billion, and with the recent refinancing activity, we're not sitting at a blended interest rate of roughly 5% overall.</p><p>In addition, the refinancing activity has allowed us to extend some of our maturities. Back in 2002, we had quite a bit due within a three-year period of time, and we've now pushed out some of that where we, with some of the new ten-year paper that we've issued during the last 12, 14 months or so, so that we now have over $0.5 billion of basically pushed-out well over 5 years, so again, improving our overall debt maturity profile that we've been working on diligently over the last year.</p><p>Turning to our long-term business model, just to give you some updates on this, some of the numbers have changed, which I will go through with you. The key drivers to the change were essentially, I guess, the three things. One is the business mix that I mentioned to you earlier, and that is the mix -- business mix of Asia in particular, as it relates to the EM numbers.</p><p>We do expect that EM Asia will continue to grow as a larger percentage of EM's overall business. And I think many of you know, the margins in EM Asia are lower, that is would be as compared with the Americas and in EMEA. However, the working capital velocity is significantly faster than in those two regions as well.</p><p>But, that will have the impact of bringing down margins, so we've brought down -- we've actually narrowed the range for Electronics Marketing. If you looked at this number last year, it was 5.5% to 6.5%. We've moved up the low end to 5.7%, but we've pulled down the high end of the range to 6.2%, again primarily as a result of the expected growth of Asia overall within the EM organization.</p><p>Technology Solutions, since Rick has -- as he pointed out earlier today, 13 consecutive years of -- quarters of year-over-year improvement in operating income dollars. And margin, it's safe to say that means his margin needs to go up. And so, we've moved where he was a year ago from 3% to 3.5%, up 20 basis points at both ends of the range so the long-term target is now 3.2% to 3.7%.</p><p>When you blend in the acquisition of Access, which again, I mentioned earlier, it would have an impact, a negative impact on margins. Overall, if you have it at that level, we're looking at margin in the 4.3% to 4.7%. And that's slightly down from where it was last year at 4.5% to 5%, again, driven primarily by business mix.</p><p>And because of that business mix change, we've also changed our working capital velocity. A year ago, the goal of -- would have been 6% to 7%. We've now pulled that up to 6.4% to 7.4%, again, recognizing the change in the mix of the business, not only at TS, but again the expected growth of EM Asia as well.</p><p>What is consistent is our goal of getting our overall business to 30% return on working capital. That's been consistent, and as I showed you earlier, we are making a consistent and steady improvement towards that goal. And we're very, very confident we will get there in the not too distant future.</p><p>Based upon the impact or the different -- slightly different mix of our overall, I guess I'll call it other assets as opposed to working capital assets. That 30% will translate to what we now believe is a return on capital of 12.5% to 13%. So in prior periods, we had a 12.5% range. Here we have a 12.5% number as our target.</p><p>We've basically added a little bit, 50 basis points to that to create a range, 12.5% to 13%, but pretty consistent overall. So, even though the mix of business will be changing, which has impact on margins and velocity, as I've mentioned, we still are highly confident in attaining our goals from our overall return on working capital and a return on capital perspective.</p><p>If you look out a little bit, just to give you an idea of trending, what we expect to happen from an operating income margin level at the Avnet level getting out to our range of about 4.3% to 4.7% in the fiscal '09 timeframe, so we would expect to approach that sometime during the latter part of fiscal '08, and so that for a -- for the entire year of fiscal '09, getting our operating margin within that range, again assuming no significant change in the business model overall.</p><p>From a working capital velocity perspective, again, this just depicts the 6.4% to 7.4% working capital velocity as I mentioned earlier, and again, getting there in the late fiscal '08 timeframe or early fiscal '0 -- I'm sorry, yes, late fiscal '08 timeframe or fiscal -- or early fiscal '09 timeframe, and as a result, getting to our return on capital goals, which on a working capital and return on total capital, you can see again, getting to the return on working capital. Created a little bit of a range here just to make it easier to read, but again, the target, 30% return on working capital and then 12.5% to 13% return on total capital employed.</p><p>And then just a summary, over the past two years, obviously substantially improved P&amp;L and balance sheet metrics, the team has done a great job and improving virtually every financial metric that we track. We continue to build operating leverage into our business model, so we do expect, as I just showed you in our long-term business model, that margins and overall returns will continue to improve.</p><p>Our dropthrough approach, that we've discussed with many of you, to budgeting, again, that's the way we focus our overall determination of how much money we're going to invest in the business from an expense perspective. And as Rick mentioned earlier, roughly 70% of our business is in people, and how much we're going to invest in people is obviously therefore, very, very important. In order to grow our business, we need to make investments in people. That's what growth is all about.</p><p>So, part of our overall strategy is, how do we redirect some of the, I'll call it, support back-office type functions to be more efficient and use some of those dollars to reinvest back into the business at an appropriate dropthrough rate, which again for those of you not familiar with concept is, for each incremental dollar of GP that is created, how much of that goes down to operating income?</p><p>And our goal varies depending upon our business unit. Business units that are attaining our long-term return on capital targets, you'll get roughly the same 50% or so dropthrough, which means again, investing 50% of the GP dollars back into the business to grow the business. Those that are not yet our targets, they have higher dropthroughs, because our goal is, we want to get to that 12.5%, 13% or 30% return on working capital before we start making further investments in the business overall.</p><p>We'll continue to manage the balance sheet. Again, we -- it is a strategy for us to get our investment grade back, as I mentioned earlier, and we're fairly confident that we'll do that in that near term. And so, profitable growth and continuous drive towards 12.5% to 13% return on capital, more consistent cash flow generation as we go forward leads to acceleration overall of shareholder value.</p><p>And as Roy mentioned earlier, from our perspective, that's the way we're defining essentially the value creation here at Avnet. As to consolidation, a lot has taken place. A lot of things have happened over the last few years, and now it's about delivering higher levels of shareholder value as we move forward.</p><p>Before I open it up for questions, I guess I'll just close out with a comment, since I know many people have already asked me a couple of times relative to where we are in guidance, you've heard some comments and asked a lot of questions of Harley and Rick and Roy, relative to where we are at this point. Even though, as they both mentioned, there's still quite a bit of time left in the quarter.</p><p>We're seeing no change in the guidance that we gave back in October when we released our Q1 results. And that's both from a -- we expect our -- both our sales and our earnings to be within the range of guidance that we provided back then, so we're not updating those numbers at all at this particular point in time.</p><p>All right? And so with that, I will open it up for questions. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ray, you were very specific on a lot of the metrics except for top line growth, and --.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: That's for -- I'll leave that to these guys over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. Well, maybe we could just sort of talk a little bit about the opportunity, especially on the TS side of the business where you're much more under-penetrated. What kind of range of growth do you think the business has over, say, the next three years?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: I'm going to leave that to Mr. Hamada to answer that.</p><p><person><nameText>RICK HAMADA</nameText></person>: [inaudible] So we're assuming an environment of an overall TAM that's going to be five, six, seven. I would tell you, putting plans together today for the next fiscal year. I would be planning around seven or eight -- and by the way, that's without another Access, another big acquisition, this is that organic growth I would plan to.</p><p>And as a COO, one of my aspirational goals I'm going to be advertising is, adamantly, a 30% return on working capital is aspiring to double-digit organic growth. Whether we plan for it or not, as an aspirational goal, I think it's possible. And I think this team can do it. But, there's a gap between what I'm trying to drive to and what we're going to plan and build our business around.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ray, as I listened to your comments and then listened to Roy's comments earlier, the day sounds a lot about a much more stable environment for yourselves and more stable financials that you were talking about on the balance sheet. One thing that you didn't talk about, and I'll ask you now, which is it looks like you're going to be able to generate some pretty consistent cash.</p><p>You've spent the last year with some acquisitions and also with -- in debt refinancing. It's not -- it doesn't seem like there's a lot, especially on the latter that you're going to have to do post sort of the next 12 months or so. Kind of what's the priorities on the sources of cash? And has the company's appetite, at least maybe at the board level, opened up a little bit to, perhaps, buying some stock back or -- you knew this was coming?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Of course.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Buying some stock back, or paying out a dividend as you guys [inaudible]?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Okay. So again, I guess if you look at our overall strategy intent, I would say as it relates to answering that specific question, the overall strategic intent is to get back to investment grade. So, we've had a lot of questions, I'd say in the last 12 months relative to buybacks and things like. And based upon that the press level of the stock price, certainly when it was back at $17 and $18, and even from our perspective today, being not at levels we think is appropriate based upon the financial performance of the company.</p><p>Having said that however, we're not in a position today of sitting with excess cash. And because we're not sitting in a position with excess cash, we didn't think it was, number one, appropriate or reasonable if we had a strategy of getting -- of maintaining or getting to investment grade to go out and borrow money in order to go back and buy back stock. So, that's why it hasn't happened up until now.</p><p>As we go forward and we look at what we think is going to be more consistent cash flow generation, I think our, I guess I believe I'll call it our philosophy or strategy will be, we want to grow the business. That is the most important things. So, as we start to generate cash, we'll evaluate where we are from a cash balance perspective and look at we see from a potential acquisition horizon as far as being able to deploy that cash. I think that would be the primary cash that we'd be sitting with because again, we believe the goal, and we'd think that shareholders would rather have us basically grow the business.</p><p>If we do get to a point where we're sitting with excess cash and don't have any acquisition opportunities and we are an investment grade, as I said before, then we would look for the appropriate way of returning capital to our shareholders. Now, whether that's a dividend or a buyback, it's too early to say, but we are -- we do believe philosophically that it's not a good thing for companies, especially like an Avnet to be sitting with untapped cash that we cannot utilize somewhere. We're not in that position today.</p><p>If we find ourselves in that position, then we will do what we think what is appropriate, which is return some of that money back to shareholders in some form, again, provided we don't have acquisition opportunities that could help us grow the business even faster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. In the two to three-year goal you've set for Technology Solutions, we're looking at that 20 basis points increase on both ends of the goal range. But, you also mentioned that the GE Access acquisition is going to be dilutive to that. So, how do we reconcile that? What's changed in the outlooks that --?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: GE will be dilutive to Avnet overall, not to Technology Solutions. So, the Access acquisition, their margins essentially, the impact of Access overall to Technology Solutions' overall margins will be negligible. There'll be some impact, plus or minus a few basis points, but it's not really impacting Technology Solutions. What I mentioned earlier is what's that impact on Avnet overall. And because of the Access acquisition, increasing TS' proportion of Avnet overall, that will bring down the Avnet operating income margins, but it'll have no impact on Technology Solutions' operating income margins.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is that on an -- on a -- kind of adding the two businesses together basis, or on the basis of including the synergies that you expect to achieve?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: It's really both, because as Rick pointed earlier, this is not a expense synergy acquisition. There'll be some synergy savings there. I think we've given our $15 million, but this is not a Memec acquisition where we have synergy of $150 million. This is a growth play where we're extending the business and growing the business. And so, there's just -- naturally in an acquisition like that and a company of Avnet's size, there are some synergies, and it's roughly $15 million, but that's not going to have a meaningful impact overall on TS' overall margin. It's a 10, 15 basis point impact overall.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is there something else in the business that's change because you have this better outlook on --?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: I think overall, what's happening is, Technology Solution's consistently out-performing, essentially, what's happening. I guess I'd point to a couple of things. One, if you break down the overall Technology Solutions business overall maybe just by regions, the Americas certainly is the highest performing business region at TS, and the under-performer historically, has been in Europe. While Europe continues to improve on a pretty steady state basis, as they do that that will have the impact of bringing up Technology Solutions' overall operating income margins.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I noticed that the question on inventories, I know you're trying to lower inventories all the time. But earlier, it was pointed out that the semiconductor cycle is less cyclical than it used to be, less volatile. All other things being equal, I wondered what impact that has on what your position is towards inventories? And secondly, how many of your semiconductor suppliers do you maintain at direct reporting relationship on a continuous basis about your inventories?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Okay. I'll let Harley answer the second question. But, I think overall, our approach towards inventory hasn't really changed relative to what's happening in the environment as opposed to what's happening within our business and the value-based management initiative. I've historically -- I would say that we were driven more from an overall net income perspective as a return on capital perspective.</p><p>As we move towards driving the business more and more towards return on capital, that required us to be much more efficient within our working capital utilization. As a result of that, we've become significantly more efficient in using inventory within the Electronics Marketing business.</p><p>So the goal essentially is, and we don't measure the goal typically from a dollar perspective. We measure the goal within our businesses, basically from an inventory turns perspective. And if business is growing, we're going to invest more money in inventory. That's what we do for a living. The goal within our business is not to drive inventory to zero. If we drove inventory to zero, we'd be out of business. As you heard earlier from -- I think both customers said, one of the things that we're [inaudible] value is asset, asset, asset.</p><p>So from our perspective, we need to have the assets. But of course, we have to have the right assets, and that's what we have done over the last few years, dramatically improved our overall asset mix. So, we measure the businesses more from a velocity or inventory turns perspective as opposed to absolute dollars. And Electronics Marketing, as an example, in the most recent few quarters I guess, it goes up and down a little bit, are basically at record levels of inventory turns.</p><p>Is there further improvement there? There might be, but we're not going to commit to it at this particular point in time. But I would say, there's probably some bias, a little bit more towards the upside from an inventory, working capital, productivity improvement at EM. But, it probably will not be as dramatic as it was over the last few years or so.</p><p>HARLEY FELDBERG: Okay. And I think the second question related to, do we provide regular inventory status to our suppliers, or how many? And the answer would be, essentially, 100% of our suppliers, semiconductor and otherwise get regular feeds and regular updates on our inventory overall. What I would say, editorializing a bit, is what they do with it varies dramatically by supplier.</p><p>So, our most progressive suppliers -- and in a way, this an ad -- this is an adjunct to what Ray just said. We're working with a number of our suppliers, and including some of our largest who are very committed to reducing inventory overall in our combined channel, and with those who are working on some real creating things relative to backing up more of the dollars further into unfinished space. That requires a shared investment commitment to things like RosettaNet and eBI and all of that.</p><p>There are obviously many other suppliers who are less progressive, in those cases we manage a more traditional relationship. But 100% of our suppliers get an inventory fee from us at least monthly.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: Hi, Ray, Lou Miscioscia from Cowan &amp; Company. I guess a good lead in to my question which is return on capital, maybe if you could start off and give us what you actually are putting your WACC at these days? And if you could also define capital? And then --.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, could you say that one more time?</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: Sure. Could you give us what your WACC is? Weighted average cost of capital? And then obviously how you're defining capital in your return on capital equation? Are you putting goodwill into it? And then I have a follow-up.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Sure okay. If I ask ten people what our weighted average cost of capital is, I think you know the answer, I'll get ten different answers.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: I'll take the average then.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Alright and I see numbers as low as in the low 9s up to one what I thought was a ridiculous number, almost 13%. So essentially the way we manage our business, we cut through all that and say our weighted average cost of capital is 10%. It's based upon all those things considered, I won't say that's an exact average, but it's close enough where that's roughly what the overall average weighted cost of capital is.</p><p>In terms of where are we including capital, we essentially include everything. So if you look at it from the right hand side of the balance sheet it's total interest bearing debt plus equity, so it would include, as my colleagues over here know quite well, it would include goodwill.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: Okay great. Then my really I guess two follow-ups to that would be it looks like you're not taking the options hit and I'm just wondering if there's any view of changing that, given a lot of the big OEMs are actually including options expense obviously in their number?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: No we are including option expense in the number.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: You are, okay.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: If you look back, it depends -- well if the numbers I just presented, hopefully if we did them right they should include option expensing. If you were to look at numbers a year ago we would not have included option expensing mainly because fiscal '06 was our first year having option expensing and we wanted to make sure we were comparing it apples-to-apples with the prior periods of time. But on a go-forward basis anything that we're presenting will at all times include option expensing. We won't point out what the number is, just so people can understand that, but our numbers do include options expensing.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: Okay so the 12.5 includes that?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Yes it does.</p><p>LOU MISCIOSCIA: Okay thank you.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: And that's a good point because now you reminded me, I said three things impacted, [as far as weighting] correctly, three things impacted overall some of our change to our model, the two biggest ones being EM Asia growth and the second one being Access, the third one not a big impact but still an impact, roughly 10 basis points of return on capital, is the fact that in last year's business model --.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Operating margin.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Operating margin --.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [inaudible - microphone inaccessible] 10 basis points on operating margin.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: But it's also the same in return on capital, roughly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Roughly. Roughly a little more than that, but it's roughly the same. So operating margin is about 10% return on capital, a little bit more than that, and so that's 10 basis points. That's roughly what we factored in so that's another reason why we basically changed our overall operating income margin down a little bit. So that is included in all of our numbers now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted to ask the top-line question a little bit different way, what sort of revenue growth do you need to hit your long-term margin target and your long-term return on capital target? And then from a cost side, what sort of flexibility do you have if revenue comes in below that?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Okay. I guess baked into our model overall is roughly in the 7 to 8% overall top-line growth. And in terms of from an expense perspective, it's an interesting question which we obviously get quite a bit. As we've mentioned a couple times today, the biggest piece of our expenses people is 70% of our people and the way we look at our business is, if we knew absolutely what was going to happen to the business over the next 12 months we could take certain actions today in order to streamline the business.</p><p>However one of the things that you need to keep in mind, and I think Roy touched upon this earlier today, there is a significant amount of cost associated with changing the expense model in business up and down. And so we've made appropriate changes over the last few years with significant reductions in expenses because we basically saw an overall change in the business on a long-term perspective.</p><p>If we saw or we felt that we'd have a continual decline in business, then we would take the appropriate actions necessary to basically hit these targets. It might make it a little bit more difficult obviously, but the goal is to get these targets through a cycle. Our expectation, as you've heard quite a bit today, is that the cycles will not be as high or as low as they used to be, so therefore we're not expecting to be put in a position of taking wholesale expense action.</p><p>But if we're proven wrong, then we'll do the things that are appropriate to deliver shareholder value as rapidly as possibly we can. And I think we've demonstrated that previously through some of the expense actions we've taken back in the 2002 time frame when the bubble burst.</p><p>JIM SUVA: Thanks Ray, Jim Suva here from Citigroup. If I look about the GE Access integration and seeing that it represents about 14% roughly of your company, is it fair to say you guys will probably take a little bit of time to digest and integrate this acquisition and therefore put future acquisitions a little bit on the back burner for a few quarters? Or is there still room to digest some more?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Well interesting question, one of the things we've found, we've done a lot of acquisitions as you well know, and one of the most important things in any acquisition is speed of integration. And this is a sizeable acquisition and a lot of people currently working, spending a lot of time preparing for the acquisition that again we mentioned should close hopefully December 31.</p><p>But our expectation at this particular point in time, although I won't say plans are final yet, but our expectation is the business from a system and a whole host of other ways of measuring it will be completed integrated by the end of June. There are certainly other things that impact integrated people, getting them to know and understand the Avnet culture and the way we do things, it takes a little bit longer, but in terms of just initial integration of systems and processes and things like that, that ought to be completed by the end of June.</p><p>In terms of what does that mean for future acquisitions, interesting question again. That depends upon what the opportunities are. It's safe to say that with the Access acquisition Rick and his team are not actively looking for, at least in the Americas and Europe, what can I acquire. Are they actively looking in Asia? The answer is absolutely yes. So if the right opportunity came along, met our return on capital targets, I'm not sure that we would shy away from it, we certainly would think twice about it. If it were in technologies in the Americas, but if it were in electronic marketing we'd look at it from a return perspective and we would probably move forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey Ray, a question for you on cash from operations. What would you expect to generate maybe in the December quarter and then also in the March quarter? Do you expect to generate cash, or use cash just from operations?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: You know interesting, one of the numbers I just had run recently and you may say I should have had this number in my back pocket a long time ago but for whatever reason didn't, wanted me to calculate. But based upon our size of working capital, if our days are impacted by one day, it's roughly $150 million of cash.</p><p>And so one of the reasons why we tend to hesitate relative to giving specific guidance on cash flow is, depending upon what happens towards the end of a month, we could easily use $100 million. In this particular quarter it is much more difficult mainly because of the Technology Solutions business, as you heard earlier, the percentage of business that gets done in the last couple weeks of December makes it difficult to predict what kind of situation we're going to be in.</p><p>But I will say overall, with our expected reduction in inventory and electronics marketing and all other things being equal from a receivable generation and payable generation of the business, that we would generate cash in the December quarter. I'm not going to give a number, but our expectation is that it would be positive and at this particular point in time I don't see any reason why it would not be positive in the March quarter as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. Is there any way maybe for calendar 2007, is there any way you could just quantify how much cash you think you could generate then, given a demand environment of basically pretty stable say 2.5% GDP growth?</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: I guess the way I would look at it now is say that, if you look at calendar year '07 that if we see modest growth in business, that we'd see certainly growth in dollars from a working capital perspective. So again it would be positive, but I'd have to sit and do some math before I gave you an answer to the question because somehow I'd get held accountable for doling a number.</p><p><person><nameText>ROY VALLEE</nameText></person>: Let me just help a little bit with the math. So we have been under spending on CapEx relative to depreciation rates since the bubble, but those lines are now intercepted. So from my perspective, I would think about CapEx and depreciation just at about neutral. So then if you take your model and run a top-line growth number, you know pick you number, 6 7%, whatever you think the right top line is, and then assume that working capital velocity is the same or maybe slightly better than current levels.</p><p>By the time we get out of this quarter we think working capital will be about -- the velocity will rise in the March quarter at EM anyway, but assume that working capital for sales is roughly flat and then compare that to net income, you know subtract that from net income, and round numbers you'll get there. So pick your own top-line number, make an assumption about working capital of sales, let CapEx and depreciation offset each other and you should be able to come up with a close estimate of cash flow.</p><p>And to Ray's point, any given quarter with the working capital so large and the net income relatively small, our quarterly period could be volatile, but our [low lean] four quarter period or an annual period should be a lot more in line with that overall model.</p><p>RAY SADOWSKI: Okay. Alright I'll turn it back over to Roy who will close it out.</p><p><person><nameText>ROY VALLEE</nameText></person>: Okay thanks Ray. Before I jump into my summary, I would like to take this opportunity to offer a special thanks to the panelists first of all for taking the time to be here in New York City, and of course all the kind words that you said about Avnet, but also for all of your business. These are terrific customers of ours, they were invited here after we screened customers for what their comments were going to be. That's actually not true.</p><p>They were actually invited here because they represent a cross section of the types of engagements we have with a variety of customers, our Tier 2 EMS, Tier 1.5 EMS, an OEM customer, an IBM VAR, a Storage VAR, a Hewlett Packard VAR, so we wanted to give you that sort of a cross section. So thanks again to those folks.</p><p>Okay so this is actually going to be brief, we're down to the home stretch unless you want to ask some more questions at the end. We've talked a little bit about this already, Avnet's value creation Arrow. I think that the point I would make is that Ray has now summarized the financials over the last several years and even more specifically over the last year or two, and I think that you can see the financials are demonstrating that we are moving into a value creation era for Avnet.</p><p>Harley and Rick then talked about what are we doing from an operating group, from a Chief Operating Officer perspective, to ensure that Avnet's future is as bright as Avnet's past. And we certainly feel that we and hopefully we were able to communicate to you the value we bring to the supply chain and why we feel the way we do. And we look at the role that distribution in general and Avnet in specific is playing in the supply chain today, and we feel very comfortable with our ability to continue to deliver value to our trading partners and in the process create value for our shareholders.</p><p>There are some proof points so I just took a snapshot here of the last three years. And the 16% revenue CAGR actually does include M&amp;A, but I thought it was fair in the context of this chart because the EPS includes all the debt and all the equity that was used in that revenue growth as well, and we were able to grow earnings at a substantially faster rate than revenues, despite the fact that some of that came from M&amp;A. And we were able to do this in EPS while deleveraging the balance sheet, as Ray showed you, down to 30% debt-to-capital here as we exited last fiscal year.</p><p>And so I'm not predicting that we're going to maintain 100% EPS growth over the next few years, but I think that if you can compare the ratio of EPS growth to earnings, if you can consider the fact that during this three-year period there was a so-called mid-cycle correction that followed the '04 time frame, and these numbers include all of that, I think you can understand why we're pretty excited about the potential we have to grow earnings at a reasonably fast rate over the next few years.</p><p>And we've talked a lot over the last few years and specifically this morning about value-based management. We're not just growing revenue, we're not just growing and counting earnings and earnings per share, at the same time we are increasing return on capital employed. And as a result of that, as Ray showed you, that is causing us to increase cash flow generation and of course with that cash we're able to do some exciting things to further augment these results. From our ROCE perspective we remain committed to at least a 12.5% after-tax return on total capital and we believe that we should be able to maybe push up a little bit beyond that, depending on mix of business.</p><p>And so, Tom, I think you asked the question what's the capital allocation strategy. Ray did a very good job of stealing my slide but it was okay because I think it's worth just touching on briefly again. You know what's happening here is we have this big market that's growing at a solid but slower secular growth rate. And we have shown you in our model that we have the ability to finance now all of that growth through retained earnings and actually still throw some excess cash off.</p><p>So the higher return on capital and the lower secular growth rate is translating into greater levels of cash flow generation than ever before in our company's history. What are we going to do with that cash? Well that's got to be the classic high class problem to deal with. This is sort of a new thing for Avnet. We used to use cash in up cycles and then throw cash in down cycles, and now we're throwing cash in up cycles and if there is a down cycle we're going to throw even more.</p><p>So what are we doing? Ray really covered this, you know number one priority is grow the core. The most profitable revenue growth we can fund is our core, but we have a disciplined approach to that that Ray mentioned called drop through, where we want to make ensure that we, to borrow a phrase from BCG, feed the stars and literally starve the dogs. So this is a massive portfolio management exercise.</p><p>Beyond that, as Ray said, we have decided strategically that we want to be an investment grade. Those folks that were on the panel, think about can I outsource 100% of my logistics operation to Avnet or can I bet my company's growth on Avnet's ability to finance me and help me as a partner grow and survive in the IT reseller world? And I don't even want them to think about that question.</p><p>So Avnet wants to be big and strong and have this balance sheet that is just unquestioned and so we've decided that investment grade ratings are important. We can't control the rating that the agency puts on us, be we certainly can control the statistics that we put up. So our real commitment is a commitment to investment grade statistics, which we believe we currently have.</p><p>As a result of that, you'll notice that the Access acquisition was announced as a for-cash deal. And so to the question of buy back, you know if we borrow $400 million and buy back Avnet shares, our coverage and leverage statistics get weakened substantially. If we use that money to acquire the EBITDA that comes with the Access integration, we're able to then actually maintain our commitment to investment grade credit statistics and actually releverage the company, moving debt-to-cap back up into the mid 30s.</p><p>And so that's why our bias right now is for M&amp;A as opposed to buy back. However, as you project out, so let's assume for a minute that we're doing all the value creating M&amp;A we can -- and by the way just one minor comment, Jim, to your question about future M&amp;A, you know with our 12.5% hurdle rate for return on capital, it is unusual that we're going to be able to do large transactions. Normally that kind of hurdle rate's going to block those. But I'm laughing because we just did Memec, now we're doing Access and so back-to-back we've had a couple of very unique opportunities to create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Going forward with that discipline, which we are hell bent for leather to maintain, it is more likely that we'll do smaller and medium-size transactions, probably acquiring some privately held individuals looking for liquidation strategies as opposed to these big blockbuster type of deals. If they come along and they meet our criteria, by all means we'll move.</p><p>They've got to match our culture, they've got to be strategically compatible with where we want to take the company and they've got to meet this return on capital hurdle rate. If they do we'll proceed, if they don't we won't. And sort of tongue-in-cheek, and I hope you take this in the right way and not the wrong way, worst case, we're going to give that cash back to our investors.</p><p>If we don't have the opportunity to make value creating M&amp;A investments and fund organic growth with it, then we'll give it back to you and how we give it back is a function of circumstances at the time. What's the stock price? What's the ROI on a buy back? What kind of dividends did we commit to? Is it material? Does it move the needle? And we'll take all those things into consideration.</p><p>And I don't think for a moment by the way that M&amp;A and buy backs are mutually exclusive. I think that as time rolls on and we continue to deliver the performance that we think we're going to deliver and our credit statistics maintain at an investment grade level and maybe even go beyond what's needed, then there will be more and more flexibility. The one thing I do know is that our model appears to be generating more cash than ever before in the past and we're going to do our very best to do smart things with that cash to further enhance the value we deliver to our shareholders.</p><p>So why should you buy AVT? Well there were a few questions just recently about the top line, look we think components are growing a little faster, computers are growing a little smaller, but we think that we've got a total available market here on a global basis that is now over $1 trillion and growing around 7% a year. If my math is right, that's about $70 billion a year of growth in the products and services that Avnet is currently involved in.</p><p>We think there's plenty of room for us to grow and I just would echo what Rick said, we will probably plan to grow slightly faster than the market and we will aspire for double-digit growth. When we build our strategies around that profitable growth pillar in the strategic framework, by operating group, by region, by business unit under the region, we're always asking them, \"What are your strategies for double-digit growth?\" We don't ask them for their strategies for 7% growth.</p><p>Now underneath that TAM what's going on? The distribution industry has proven itself vital. It has for many, many years, it was in question during the bubble, it's reemerged as being absolutely vital to the supply chain and in fact the industry is performing well. And I'd like to point out that, relative to other participants in the supply chain, distribution has an extremely diversified revenue stream. No single supplier concentration, no single customer concentration, this is a well diversified revenue and profit stream.</p><p>So now, drilling down on Avnet, hey look I think you'd probably be disappointed if I didn't make this pitch, Avnet is growing globally faster than the market we serve and we're doing that organically and then added the value creating M&amp;A growth to that. So that's the growth story.</p><p>We have operating leverage in our model, we are managing the business so as to maintain that operating leverage, and by the way I would tell you that the magic in distribution for earnings growth is around that SG&amp;A and operating income leverage as opposed to -- you know you didn't hear a lot of strategies today about how we're going to raise gross margin by 2 or 3%, that's a very difficult thing for us to do.</p><p>We have a lot of effort there to make sure we maintain, slightly grow, slightly decrease, but the real leverage in distribution is the operating leverage around the SG&amp;A and creating value off of that scale that we've talked about so much today.</p><p>Now why we're doing that from an earnings point of view, driving our return on capital further into double-digit territory, why 12.5? Because we think in order to be fully valued at our earnings stream we need a return on capital that's 2.5 to 3 points than WACC. As we increase debt as a percentage of total capital we're actually pushing WACC down a bit, our debt capital is a lot less expensive than our equity capital, and so we're going to drive in that 12.5 to 13% range.</p><p>We have a strong balance sheet, we will maintain that strong balance sheet as measured by coverage and leverage, we have rising cash flow generation, not just during the down cycle but now through the entire cycle, and I'd like to remind you that even through the component correction, the '04/'05 cycle, on a rolling four-quarter basis our electronics marketing operating margins were holding fairly steady, while our TS margins were continuing to expand.</p><p>And in the current inventory correction that's going on, we have yet to see a contraction in operating profit margin. So the new paradigm might be up, sideways and then up some more, whereas the old paradigm was up, down, up, down.</p><p>Moving on, Harley mentioned this, I'd like to mention it again except that the Avnet Inc. [inaudible], I am very proud of our global leadership team. Most of the folks who are in my direct-report staff are 20-year proven performers within the distribution industry and within Avnet in specific, and we intend to leverage that stability to create further strategic advantage.</p><p>And the last thing I'd like to say about Avnet in specific is that we have this balance of our business between electronics marketing and technology solutions, and then within the two groups this diversified portfolio of suppliers and customers. So we offer you these financial metrics in a relatively low data environment.</p><p>I'm just going to close by saying that you know the macroenvironment that we operate in, coupled with Avnet's strategy and Avnet's execution, has brought us into this value creation era. We really believe that it's here. It's happening now and our results over the last couple of years have proved it. And you saw our Vision Statement, it hasn't changed for many years and it says that we are committed to delivering value to you our investors.</p><p>So we are intensely focused on the notion of shareholder value creation and we believe, by the way, as a result of that, we'll get TSR if we can build economic profitability the total shareholder returns will come eventually, even if we're trading at 10 times forward right?</p><p>So on behalf of our Board of Directors, on behalf of the presenters today and the balance of our executive team, on behalf of all the employees of Avnet, I thank you for being here today and thank you for your interest in Avnet. Vince do we have time for questions?</p><p>VINCE KEENAN: Well I think what we'll do is we'll take a few questions, I know some of you have got to go. If you want to grab a lunch on your way out, please feel free, and happy holidays to everyone.

Nathan Gardels is the editor in chief of The WorldPost.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PARIS - In the 1950s, French President Charles de Gaulle understood that if France wanted to create its own space for sovereign action in a world dominated by the United states and the Soviet Union, it had to possess its own nuclear force. Today, in the emerging global order dominated by the United States and China, artificial intelligence has become the most powerful resource that will determine the fate of nations in the times ahead. The only chance for not just France but Europe as a whole to remain a player is to participate fully in the development of AI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The robust competition between America and China is accelerating the rapid evolution of machine learning, which will transform all aspects of life from employment and the social contract to genetic engineering and warfare. The pace of change is so swift that being left behind will make it nearly impossible to catch up. If that happens, Europe will become irretrievably subordinated to the geopolitical algorithms of others.</p><p>A new book by AI technologist and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,\" ought to serve as a loud wakeup call for Europe. Not surprisingly, Europe warrants little ink in Lee's book. As Lee sees it, while Silicon Valley and China are driving each other forward in the advance of AI, with an entrepreneurial frenzy abetted by abundant capital and a densely connected consumer base, Europe lacks a comparable innovation ecosystem or integrated digital marketplace. Its default alternative has been simply to accept the full platforms of the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In essence, Europe has become a colony in the American tech empire.</p><p>Because emergent technologies arise in response to social demand, Lee does, however, see an opening for Europe. While AI development in China and the United States is driven primarily by the quest for data and analytics that can be used commercially, Europeans are focused more on protecting the privacy of the user. As Lee told us in an interview: \"That will cause the American giants some amount of trouble and may give local European entrepreneurs the chance to build something that is more consumer and individual-centric and that would go further than American companies would ever contemplate in protecting privacy.\"</p><p>Europe's leaders should seize this opportunity by fostering a continent-wide collaboration to put its distinct stamp on AI. The most promising prospect for Europe would be to blaze a different path than the United States or China. It could put its resources behind the proposal of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, to \"re-decentralize\" the Internet, both to assure a fairer allocation of the digital dividend and hand back control of personal data from big tech to individuals.</p><p>This culture-bound constraint on data collection, in turn, would reorient the development of AI in a more social instead of consumer-marketing direction, which has been the main focus of both China and Silicon Valley. Europe could further choose to compete where it has an advantage in basic science. Just as Europe joined together to create the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest particle accelerator, European nations could cooperate on a project to be the first to build super-intelligent machines, ones that surpass human capacities.</p><p>The potential is there. The Scandinavian countries, of course, have long been engaged in the fray with such innovations as Skype and Spotify. Germany has its own digital modernization strategy, \"Industry 4.0,\" aimed at upgrading its manufacturing base through machine-learning tools. And though not gaining much traction so far, Chancellor Angela Merkel has highlighted the importance of European Union investment in AI. She has even mused that Europe could present a third way for AI.</p><p>France, a core nation of Europe alongside Germany, can make a critical contribution. As the most active modernizer on the European scene today, French President Emmanuel Macron is well positioned to promote Europe's role as a third pillar of the AI revolution. Like de Gaulle in his time, Macron has an intuitive sense of what it takes to stay in the game - and a bold political imagination to figure out how to do so. From his first days in office, he has focused on invigorating Europe's entrepreneurial culture and bolstering state support for innovation, especially in AI.</p><p>\"My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI,\" he said. \"If you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution.\" Drawing on his country's heritage as a cradle of scientific discovery and the Enlightenment, he has recruited the brainy mathematician and AI guru C\u00e9dric Villani to lay the foundation for France's effort.</p><p>Macron is on the right track. The AI challenge may be just the summons a continent torn apart by persistent centrifugal forces - financial crisis, immigration and populism - needs to embrace unity more fully. An ambitious historic project aimed at reaping the economic benefits of AI, securing an independent presence for European values in the new world order and leading a scientific breakthrough to superintelligence would provide a binding narrative for a continent adrift. Such a moonshot vision would be far more compelling for Europeans than the tired pitch from Brussels that dourly sells a common Europe as canned spinach, something the paternal authorities say is good for you but that everyone hates.</p><p>Belatedly grasping what is at stake, E.U. regulators are now taking rearguard action against American big tech through the General Data Protection Regulation and other means. But if Europe wants to get ahead of the game, to recover the sovereign ability to chart its own course, it needs an innovation ecosystem that makes it the author of its own algorithms while at the same time building on its unique strengths in science.</p><p>                          This was produced by                                                  The WorldPost                                                 , a partnership of the                                                  Berggruen Institute                                                  and The Washington Post.                    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-e954e79af9ad4aea8e4c8605e3ba8f11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-SRH1-JB4M-V397-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><timeReceived>3:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In global M&amp;A revenue for 2018 it ranked a lowly \"\" by its own standards \"\" second, behind Goldman but ahead of Morgan Stanley, according to Dealogic.This is not quite complete dominance, but it is unquestioned leadership that has been built and sustained over many years and through different phases of crisis, recovery, coordinated global growth and, more recently, returning macro uncertainty.The different investment banking revenue pools have waxed and waned, but JPMorgan's overall share has remained market-leading and recently has been growing faster than at any of its rivals.For the first half of 2019, JPMorgan retained its lead in this global investment banking revenue ranking with a market share of 9.2%, 120 basis points ahead of second-placed Goldman Sachs with 8%.\"The difference between JPMorgan and everyone else is our scale and how balanced we are,\" says Daniel Pinto, chief executive of the corporate and investment bank and co-president and chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Daniel Pinto</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>JPMorgan ranks number two in M&amp;A, where the other leading firms are Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which it also competes with in ECM, where JPMorgan ranks first. It is also number one in DCM and syndicated loans, but in that business the other leading firms are Bank of America and Citi.You can extend the analysis through the secondary markets businesses, using Coalition rankings for full year 2018. Look across fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and JPMorgan ranks top overall. Go down into underlying businesses and JPMorgan ranks joint first in credit trading, along with Deutsche Bank. It ranks first in securitization in which Bank of America comes second.JPMorgan ranks first in equity derivatives, where this time the nearest rivals are Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. It ranks first in G10 rates, where Goldman and Citi are the next two firms.JPMorgan also tops the Euromoney client survey for overall FX market share ahead of Deutsche and puts HSBC and Citi joint second in the G10 category. Coalition compiles rankings on seven secondary market categories in FICC and four in equities. JPMorgan ranks first in six of these 11 categories and is not outside the top three in any of them. There are five in which Goldman Sachs does not appear among the top three; seven in which Morgan Stanley is outside the top three; and four in which Citi misses out.Everywhere you look there's a tough competitor. But there is only one bank at or challenging close to the top in every single category. It's a remarkable, perhaps unprecedented, position to be in. Stable businessJPMorgan is the global investment bank that sidestepped the pressure that fell on every other firm to give up the dream of delivering every product to every type of client in every region and to concentrate instead only on those services where they were best-in-class or on particular geographies where they had strong customer franchises.While most firms specialized, JPMorgan diversified. While some chose to be regional champions, it built itself into a global one.That sounds like a risky strategy, especially with regulators training their sights on the too-big-to-fail banks. But maybe it's quite the opposite.\"What this means is that over time and through the cycle, we have a more stable business,\" says Pinto. \"In the era of post-crisis regulation, scale is essential. These businesses are expensive machines to run, and without scale, it is hard to be profitable.\"Take FICC, he says, one of the lower return businesses: \"The more flow you can internalize, the better the prices you can offer. That lets you put more business through the machine at attractive marginal profitability. Scale allows for the profitability to invest in talent and technology.\"That profitability is reflected in return on equity at the corporate and investment bank, which has risen to 16% for 2018, up from 13% five years earlier, even though the division now operates on 15% more capital than it did back in 2014.\u00a0 Balance sheet, human and technology resources are expensive to deliver. But the truth is that clients tend to want some businesses that are profitable for a bank and some that are unprofitable \u00a0-\u00a0Daniel Pinto Analysts calculate JPMorgan Chase's cost of equity at below 10%. The bank is happy to make big strategic investments. It earns the capital to afford these. It also prides itself on running day-to-day costs with increasing efficiency. The CIB's overhead ratio stood at 61% in 2014. Five years later it is 57%.This is a disciplined firm, working in a complex business. The challenge for the chief executive of any bank trying to reconfigure its investment banking division is that it is almost impossible to identify and cut the unprofitable businesses and keep only the profitable ones.It is difficult not just because these services have traditionally been bundled. From one year to the next, those that are profitable changes. Activities that once brought in the big returns and subsidized the loss leaders can swap places and become the low-return offerings that are a cost of staying in other more profitable businesses.\"We do constant reviews to evaluate the capital, resource consumption and profitability of each client relationship over time,\" says Pinto. \"Balance sheet, human and technology resources are expensive to deliver. But the truth is that clients tend to want some businesses that are profitable for a bank and some that are unprofitable. You need to be able to deliver both.\"It seems to us that some firms may have made a mistake by looking at overall profitability when it might have been better to look at marginal profitability,\" he continues. \"There is a lot of fixed cost that does not go away. FICC, for example, is a low ROE business. But if a bank exits or sharply cuts back, it may find itself worse off. Even with the overall wallet dropping, at this level of market share, we can hold on for a very long time and still be profitable. And clients need those services, so it's important to be a complete provider.\"JPMorgan wants to be a complete provider, operating at scale to ensure efficiency and globally to further bolster diversification. Revenues from event businesses like ECM and M&amp;A can be lumpy. Markets businesses can be volatile. Be big enough in enough of them, however, and even if the revenue comes from different segments in any given period, the aggregate result starts to look dependable.     Prudent managementJPMorgan could have made a strong case to win our award as the world's best investment bank in any one of the last 10 years. But there is something fitting about bestowing the accolade now.JPMorgan had already been building its capabilities in advisory and financing in the years leading up to the financial crisis, but it only emerged as a global powerhouse in 2009, a banner year for equity raising and advising companies on asset sales and ways to transform their corporate and capital structures.Saved by prudent management of its own balance sheet and liquidity from the carnage that beset the rest of the financial industry, JPMorgan was one of the last investment banks still standing without government support. And it made hay.For a time, the question became: is JPMorgan a bank for a crisis, but not first choice when times are easier? Fast forward a decade and the bank's market share of global investment banking revenue in 2018 was the highest it has been since 2009.\"The flight to quality continues today,\" says Viswas Raghavan, chief executive of JPMorgan for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \"Issuers still see the attraction of having a very strong banking partner that will be able to support them in bad times as well as good, and that became very evident during the crisis. Similarly, across the markets businesses on the institutional investor side, those clients also want a strong and dependable counterparty that won't disappear when markets are difficult.\"\u00a0 We aim to lead in every business, but in order to be a complete provider, we have to ensure we offer a best-in-class service across the whole range of activities \u00a0-\u00a0Viswas Raghavan But don't we live in the era of unbundled financial services where wholesale consumers \"\" both asset managers, which are themselves answerable to end customers, and corporations answerable to shareholders \"\" face a heightened duty to prove that they have picked only the best provider at the most competitive price in each financial service they purchase?\"We aim to lead in every business, but in order to be a complete provider, we have to ensure we offer a best-in-class service across the whole range of activities,\" says Raghavan, \"which also includes the more annuity-like businesses such as cash management, payments and securities services. That way, the chief executive and the CFO no longer see you as the bank that only comes knocking to sell them on a rights issue or an M&amp;A deal but as the bank that supports their financial lifeblood. That's when the client can say: \"~Not only do they provide an excellent service on strategy and financing, they also support me every day with working capital,' for example.\"Most banks have had to bite the bullet and pull back or withdraw from certain activities, while JPMorgan alone has been able to stay the course, drawing the lesson from the post-crisis regulatory response that to be successful it had to be big.\"As returns and margins were compressed, so volume and efficiency were key,\" says Pinto. \"In FICC, the wallet has gone from $160 billion 10 years ago to $120 billion five years ago and $100 billion today. Now if you look back five years, our market share in FICC has gone from 9% to 12%. In equities, the wallet was always smaller, but at least it has stayed flat for the past five years. And there too our share has grown from 8% to 11%.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Viswas Raghavan\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Growing strength in the markets businesses also sustains the primary capital markets activities that are the traditional yardstick of investment banking success. And while the specialist advisory boutiques may still describe JPMorgan as a financing firm that doesn't have many true M&amp;A stars, that's a criticism that now drips like water off the back of a very large and unconcerned duck.JPMorgan advised on more than $1 trillion in announced M&amp;A in 2018, including important deals such as Takeda's $82 billion acquisition of Shire, IBM's $34 billion purchase of Red Hat and Walmart's $16 billion acquisition of Flipkart, India's largest online retailer. It participated in seven of the top 10 fee-paying deals in 2018.JPMorgan derived more revenue from global financial sponsors in 2018 than did second-ranked Goldman Sachs. The two firms exchanged places at the top of that closely contested leader board.As the global head of advisory at another firm points out: \"We pay particular attention to that ranking because private equity firms are the most discerning purchasers of investment banking services across M&amp;A, IPOs and capital raising and financing.\"As Euromoney went to press, JPMorgan was, together with Credit Suisse and Bank of America, advising Infineon Technologies on the German chipmaker's $10 billion offer for Silicon-Valley based Cypress Semiconductor.\"It's a highly strategic, cross-border deal for a European company into the US, in which we are supporting Infineon right in the midst of current trade tensions,\" says Raghavan.JPMorgan was also a joint global coordinator on the $1.5 billion new issue in London of Huatai Securities, the debut Chinese offering following the agreement of a link between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges.\"It's an important Asia-into-Europe transaction that underlines the view that, even after Brexit, London will remain a leading global listing venue,\" says Raghavan.\u00a0 Like everyone else, we certainly looked into the abyss,\" says Rohrbaugh. \"But even then, we were allowed to invest \u00a0-\u00a0Troy Rohrbaugh JPMorgan played a lead role on the successful IPO of Dutch payments firm Adyen in June, which was closely watched following the withdrawal of a number of European IPOs in May. The bank is sole adviser to Ireland-based Allergan on the proposed $63 billion cash and stock sale to AbbVie, facing Morgan Stanley on the other side, a deal announced as Euromoney went to press.JPMorgan's investment bankers are of course fortunate that they have a not-so-secret weapon that can help win important mandates. It doesn't hurt when your bank's chief executive is the iconic figure in the global banking industry and likes to go on the road and make a pitch.\"Jamie [Dimon] is great with clients and he likes to be included in deals,\" says Pinto. \"And when he is, it is very likely that JPMorgan will have a lead role.\"It's very different today from when Dimon first arrived at JPMorgan following its purchase of Bank One in 2004, a deal that installed him as chief executive in waiting, a role he formally took on in January 2016.Readers of our profile of Dimon in Euromoney's 50th anniversary issue in June will recall his caustic first impression: \"I remember when I first got here some of the investment bankers telling me that the consumer bank was holding them and the company back. I told them: \"~No. You're doing a shitty job all on your own. The consumer bank is not holding you back.'\"     Looking into the abyssThey are doing a better job now. Look again at the decision to stay the course in FICC, particularly rates and credit that, both in cash principal position taking to support client activity and associated derivatives, have been hardest hit by higher regulatory capital charges. It's not only many of the largest European banks that have had to pull back. Even leading US firms such as Morgan Stanley had to rethink and trim the business.It may not have been apparent to the outside world, but JPMorgan too, even if it didn't quite suffer an existential crisis, certainly had to review its commitment to FICC.The pre-crisis history of JPMorgan and its predecessors Chase and Chemical was that it would have a couple of great quarters in FICC and then periodically blow up. That was the memory that many of the senior people still carried after the crisis.Troy Rohrbaugh, now head of global markets at JPMorgan, joined the bank in 2005 in foreign exchange. He was asked to take charge of rates in 2012, which was a good year, as was 2013. Then in 2014 the rates marked collapsed. It was not looking good for any firm. Pinto and Dimon decided to review it.\"I believe that at any other bank senior management would have been asking me to decide whether or not to close portions of the business down,\" Rohrbaugh tells Euromoney.\"I gave Daniel and Jamie a couple of scenarios: basically, saying that the business could normalize but that if things went on like this, the outlook was really bad. The most important thing is they didn't panic. I remember Jamie saying: \"~What are we going to do: not trade US treasuries, not trade European government bonds? That would be like running a store that doesn't sell bread or milk. No.' In the end, both Jamie and Daniel said we are going to stay in this business and also told me not to cut the technology budget, noting when it turns it could be good.\"The decisions not to cut back led to very profitable years in 2015 and 2016.\"Like everyone else, we certainly looked into the abyss,\" says Rohrbaugh. \"But even then, we were allowed to invest.\"Some of that investment went into recruiting high-quality people the bank had been talking to for some time and who now suddenly became available.JPMorgan today famously budgets $11.5 billion a year for technology with almost half of that going on change-the-bank new investments and the rest paying the bills to run the bank and keep the lights on. Looking at the bank's leadership position today, it's interesting to hear that Dimon was telling business leaders to maintain their tech budgets even during the toughest times five years ago. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Troy Rohrbaugh\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>The present success of JPMorgan in investment banking is also in large part the result of long-term thinking for which the banking industry has not always been renowned.Rohrbaugh tells the story of how, after seeing the light on technology investment, JPMorgan was able to regain the leadership position in one markets business that it had let slip and attain leadership in another that it had never previously come close to.At the very top of Euromoney's definitive global foreign exchange market share survey, Citibank, with its far-flung international empire, was the lead bank for 20 years until Deutsche Bank overtook it, thanks to the German bank's embrace of new technology. But the predecessor banks of JPMorgan were always close to the top.Chase nearly knocked Citibank off its perch in 1996, when just 6bp of market share separated them and kept Chase in second place, with 9.04% of market share to Citi's 9.10%. And in 2000 when Deutsche finally eclipsed Citibank, so too did Chase, which again finished second, with Citi now down in third. By 2004, however, JPMorgan had fallen back into fourth place and was losing touch with the top two. In 2005, it came seventh. In 2006, it was ninth with a market share of just 3.9%, compared with run-away leader Deutsche's 19.3%.Rohrbaugh's first years at JPMorgan were devoted to charting the long march back in foreign exchange.\"We had the bandwidth, the money and the resources, but we had completely missed out on e-trading in FX,\" says Rohrbaugh.He recalls a particular client visit where, as usual, he asked to speak at the client's workstation to gauge its regular set up instead of in a meeting room. The client had arranged it so that JPMorgan was on the desktop along with Barclays and Deutsche, which was nice of them. But Rohrbaugh knew the client did close to zero with JPMorgan. The client told Rohrbaugh that Barx had some great features, but it then turned out he couldn't remember his log in.\"So, you do everything on Autobahn?\" Rohrbaugh asked. \"Yes, pretty much,\" the client admitted, noting that straight-through processing with Deutsche outweighed many other features.\"It hit me like an epiphany,\" says Rohrbaugh, \"that price no longer really mattered as much. The first thing we had to do was properly integrate our entire FX platform from front to back and then reconnect to clients.\"It wasn't quite that simple of course.\"In the first years, we still struggled to get some more price-sensitive clients to use our platform, and they told us we needed something else that distinguished us,\" Rohrbaugh says. \"So, we became the first major bank to develop FX algos, which we thought would also be useful for our own traders. Then we worked on the whole user experience, for example being first to allow wholesale clients to trade on their mobile phones, not because we really expected many of them to do so, more because they could just whip out their iPhones and say: \"~Isn't this cool?' But we have worked since to enable clients to access the markets at any time of the day or night, wherever they are in the world.\"The fight back from the humiliation of 2006 played out over 12 years. In 2018, JPMorgan ranked top of the Euromoney FX market share survey. It stayed there in 2019 \"\" results were announced in June \"\" with 9.81% of overall client business, 140bp ahead of Deutsche in second with 8.41%.   Fortress balance sheetAs a market leader across investment banking, the new obsession of senior management at JPMorgan is to fight against complacency and any sense of entitlement that today's top dog will always be so.\"What happened in foreign exchange shows that it is sometimes easier to miss key changes to your business when you are a market leader,\" says Rohrbaugh, \"and you are slow to admit the need for change. I remind anyone who thinks we will always be top in foreign exchange that we have been here before and we let it slip.\"It wasn't like that in equities. JPMorgan was not traditionally even close to being a leader in secondary equities markets and was slow to spot that investment in technology might offer a chance to close the gap to the top firms.\"We used to believe very much in the high-touch relationship coverage model,\" admits Pinto, \"but that's not how the equities business evolved. It is more technology-led today than any other markets business. We execute a lot of trades with our algorithms. Clients check the quality of our execution with their algos. And if we are not the best of the best, they simply direct their business elsewhere.\"But they don't have too many options to turn to.Today, JPMorgan still lags slightly behind established number-one firm Morgan Stanley in cash equities and second-placed Goldman Sachs, but it is breathing down the necks of the leaders, having pulled slightly ahead of them in equity derivatives and listed futures and options.\"Equities is a very fast-moving train for anyone else to try and catch up with now,\" says Pinto, who believes that regulators, by mandating unbundling, have played into the hands of the leading firms.\"It always seemed obvious that unbundling under Mifid II [the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive] would only help the larger institutions, because once you separate research and execution, those firms with the big tech budgets and advanced trading capabilities would capture even more business. And when asset managers are paying for research with their own money and taking a hit to margins, they are likely to consume maybe 30% to 40% less of it. That also tends to tip the wallet to the bigger firms with top-ranked research. Our market share in equities in Europe has gone from 11% to 14%, and that has compensated for any drop in research revenue.\" I want us positioned around volatility events so we have capacity to do client business. The genius of this bank's leadership is that the review after the fourth quarter of last year was pretty much like after any other \u00a0-\u00a0Troy Rohrbaugh But what most helped JPMorgan establish itself in equities was the fortress balance sheet that in the lead up to the crisis had the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury regularly knocking on Jamie Dimon's door with the next firm that needed rescuing.\"We had not invested in equities sufficiently and we were missing a key piece in a prime services platform, which all the top firms in equities had,\" says Rohrbaugh. The acquisition of Bear Stearns was pivotal. \"It gave us a legitimate prime platform, albeit one that was quite US-centric. JPMorgan saw the value in that and invested in building a global prime platform. As well as being a leader in equity derivatives and with a strong prime platform, we now have a great cash equities business winning share with real money accounts.\"Equities has been a 10-year build.\"It was clear when we acquired the prime platform that the pay-off would be five years in the future,\" says Rohrbaugh. \"It was the same in FX from 2006 to 2009.\"But if these investments can hurt JPMorgan's financials in the early years, when they do pay off, they can pay off handsomely.\"Don't think we pour investment into a black hole,\" says Rohrbaugh. \"We have monthly meetings with Daniel to review progress, check that we are on track, ask if we are seeing anything significant in other markets. Every so often, we go and see Jamie and talk through significant investments and more often than not he says: \"~Tell me what you need. Tell me why you need it and\"\u00a6 you're done.'\"In the years I have been at this bank, more and more thinking has turned to long-term investment in the franchise.\"This is not a bank that solves for the quarter.Euromoney asks Rohrbaugh what the review for the markets business was like after the horror-show fourth quarter of 2018.\"Daniel [Pinto] is a trader. He knows that there are days when you lose money as the price of being in the market for your clients,\" he says. \"I want us positioned around volatility events so we have capacity to do client business. The genius of this bank's leadership is that the review after the fourth quarter of last year was pretty much like after any other. In fact, after a bad quarter is typically when Daniel is often most supportive. It's after a good quarter that he's more likely to press you on what you missed.\" Chasing opportunitiesTalk to any of the leaders at JPMorgan now and they will express discomfort at being the leading firm, a fear that complacency will cost them if it creeps in, and a determination not to let it by clinging to the institutional memory of what happened in foreign exchange, for example. And that tone is set from the very top.\"I grew up scrappy,\" Dimon told Euromoney in June. \"And you've got to have fire in your gut.\"\"I'm a much better underdog,\" says Raghavan, who outlines some gaps to shoot for. \"If I look at our treasury services franchise, we are very good with financial institutions, but we have more to do with corporate clients.\"That puts the firm in a battle with HSBC and Citi. And for all the talk of the victory of US firms in global investment banking, that's not how Raghavan sees it.\"I would suggest that this whole notion of the retreat of European banks has been very much overplayed,\" says Raghavan. \"Remember that we have established operations in many European countries dating back over a century. But in any year, we might be number two in the UK or three in Germany or France, behind the national reference banks.\"What distinguishes JPMorgan is that we also want to be considered a national reference bank in each major economy. There are still lots of organic opportunities for us to chase in each market. Our plan is to close each of those gaps down systematically.\"Pinto takes the same line: \"There is always some business or some geography where we are not number one and still have work to do.\" What distinguishes JPMorgan is that we also want to be considered a national reference bank in each major economy. There are still lots of organic opportunities for us to chase in each market. Our plan is to close each of those gaps down systematically \u00a0-\u00a0Viswas Raghavan He mentions trade finance, a rare business in corporate and investment banking where JPMorgan is far behind the leaders, albeit out of choice, Pinto explains: \"Trade finance is very balance-sheet and capital intensive, so returns are low. I wanted to support our client franchise, but I didn't feel the need to be a top provider.\"\u00a0But watch out.\"We are reviewing that,\" he says. \"We are going to take another look and see if our approach makes sense. We are very client-centric, and if clients really want us to provide a service alongside other business, such as FX or payments, then we may rethink it.\"But there's a question here. A 9.2% market share in global investment banking revenue is high by historic standards and the gap to Goldman in second place of close to 120bp is wide. How much further can JPMorgan go?In markets, Rohrbaugh says: \"We may be close to the upper limits. In FICC, if the wallet keeps shrinking, there's a chance our share might inch higher if more banks pull out. But it would be a healthier outcome for JPMorgan if the wallet were to grow, even if our share shrinks.\"Pinto looks at the overall share and, with the bank running at around 9.2% of investment bank revenue for the year to June, takes a similar view.\"I'm not sure it's possible to go much higher,\" he says. \"Managing conflicts alone is one barrier and clients like to have numerous counterparties.\"But even if they do want less market share with JPMorgan, that can be tricky.\"They do need certain products and services often delivered globally and always efficiently,\" says Pinto.     Digital futureJPMorgan will continue to defend what it has. It is also building now for what clients are likely to want and need in a digital future, where blockchain may be more prominent in primary capital markets and secondary trading; securities settlement may become same day and close to real time with real time payments too. Credit trading will follow its own path of increasing electronification, albeit distinct from that of the markets in more homogenous underlyings such equities and currencies.Technology may also bring surprises. It's not entirely clear how artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and robotic software will impact advisory and new issues for example. JPMorgan just has to put down some table stakes and back itself not to get played out of this game.\"The one thing we must avoid is inertia,\" says Raghavan. \"We can import talent, for example through our \"~In-Residence' programme, which draws in external fintech entrepreneurs who are sponsored to develop and test their ideas at scale by securely using our platform. But we also want to allow for a different mind-set for a big bank and a culture that holds the notion that it is not just OK to try new ideas and fail, but that it is really important to do so\"\u00a6 as long as we fail fast of course.\"Nowhere is the rallying cry to disrupt from within louder than in the new wholesale payments division that the bank unveiled at the start of this year.Like many big universal banks, JPMorgan was quick to realize after the great financial crisis that transaction services, once considered a necessary but dull part of commercial banking, would become a powerful driver for corporate and investment banking.Treasury services revenue at JPMorgan has been growing faster than at the competition, up from $3.6 billion in 2016 to $4.7 billion for 2018. That is partly thanks to rising rates in the US, but the division has also been growing its share of operational deposits from corporate and financial customers in all regions of the world.In January 2019, JPMorgan combined its treasury services business with its merchant acquiring platform, which handles retail and other customer payments for large and many small businesses covered by Chase retail branches. Takis Georgakopoulos heads the new wholesale payments division and reports both to Pinto and to Gordon Smith, chief executive of consumer and community banking. We are developing these innovations, like the virtual accounts, because our customers are asking us for them. These ideas come from them, and our job is to figure whether and how we can provide them at scale \u00a0-\u00a0Takis Georgakopoulos That sounds a little complicated and, perhaps to help, Georgakopoulos asks Euromoney's first question for us.\"Why did we put treasury services and merchant acquiring together? Because they are both scale businesses and combining them helps achieve greater economies. Treasury services at JPMorgan manages $6 trillion of payments a day, while merchant acquiring processes $1.4 trillion a year for about 300,000 merchant clients.\"Remember, we are the only big bank with a captive merchant acquiring business, with most of the other leading providers being independents. Combining them means at the front end we can have one set of rules and processes for client on-boarding and for KYC [know your customer regulations], while at the back end, because both businesses are about moving money, there are components of infrastructure that can be reused.\"But the real benefit comes from using that scale to provide new value-added services for clients.\"The bank is building an integrated platform for payments, called Graphite, to replace a previously fragmented infrastructure, a build that began three years ago and today also spans global markets. In that time, the business has grown its headcount and technology budget by double-digit percentages.The bank is now running teams looking at application interface (API) development, real-time payments, user experience design, blockchain, digital coins and partnerships with fintechs. No other big payments bank is investing at such a rate. And these teams are kept separate from run-the-bank duties and measured on client adoption, not revenue and profit.What new products and services are bubbling away behind the scenes?The wholesale payments business has been developing new end-to-end services for e-commerce companies aiming to accommodate merchants selling their goods on multiple platforms across the US, EU and Asia and needing to accept many different types of payment from customers and in many currencies.\"We can handle all methods of payments in the US and EU and will soon expand that to Asia and Latin America,\" says Georgakopoulos. \"We are now proposing a new system of virtual, multi-currency accounts unique to each seller that can access all currencies they receive from purchasers and for which they will be able to set their own rules for paying out to their own conventional accounts.\"For large companies, these virtual accounts will be able to provide everything a conventional account does.\"And for smaller merchants, we will have our first prototype virtual accounts in beta testing by the end of this year,\" Georgakopoulos says.The benefit for clients is that they will be able to see the full picture of cash flowing in and out, as well as idle balances in all currencies in one place. That should help smaller merchants develop the same kind of cash-flow forecasting insights that the big banks provide to the largest multinational companies.\"If clients leave balances with us, interest on those can offset merchant services fees,\" says Georgakopoulos. \"And because we are one bank running an integrated payments infrastructure across the world, small businesses will be able to see same-day settlement in cross-border payments.\"It occurs to him that he may not have made one thing clear: \"We are developing these innovations, like the virtual accounts, because our customers are asking us for them. These ideas come from them, and our job is to figure whether and how we can provide them at scale.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Takis Georgakopoulos</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Even before the merger of treasury services and merchant acquiring and the latest development of virtual accounts, JPMorgan was already gaining renown as an innovator across the payments business.</p><p>It was the first bank to offer real-time payments in dollars, euros and sterling on its new Graphite platform, and the first US bank to create and test a digital stablecoin, pegged one-to-one to the dollar, for instantaneous cross-border payments.</p><p>This works on the Quorum blockchain and the plan is to allow wholesale clients eventually to use variants of JPM Coin in other fiat currencies too.</p><p>Last year, JPMorgan became the first bank to bring blockchain into full production in payments, with its interbank information network (IIN), which uses distributed-ledger technology to speed up checking on transfers between JPMorgan and its relationship banks that may have been held up for sanctions screening or due to incomplete filling in of information fields.</p><p>\"We were early adopters of blockchain and trialled it extensively, moving money cross border within JPMorgan. But moving money internally or among our correspondent banks is not really a problem 98% of the time,\" says Georgakopoulos. \"It's quick, it's secure, it's straight-through processing.\"</p><p>The problem is the 2% of the time when a payment gets stopped due to incomplete identity information for example, which can require going back from bank to bank in the network to check who has the information in the missing field. That has traditionally been done by email and phone calls, and can take days or even weeks.</p><p>\"That 2% can amount to 80,000 payments a day for us,\" says Georgakopoulos. \"So having a network where every one of our correspondent banks is connected to every other and can quickly check those information fields, without having any one central depositary hold all that information, is immensely valuable. We have more than 250 correspondent banks now signed up. The next step is to encourage more to go beyond signing and start using it every day.\"</p><p>And what is the longer vision for the IIN?</p><p>\"Right now, this is only for our relationship banks with certain KYC and AML [anti-money laundering] standards,\" says Georgakopoulos. \"But in the future, it is possible that we may open it up to corporate clients, maybe to e-commerce companies and ultimately even our competitors.</p><p>\"It is possible more services may go onto the network. We do fraud detection very well. We have very big lists of bad beneficiaries and excellent algorithms for detecting anomalies. Smaller banks just have less history and data to work with. I could see a time when we might provide that through an API on the network, which might also be the perfect place to host a KYC utility provided by a fintech. Our goal is to make correspondent banking more secure.\"</p><p>And what about transacting payments?</p><p>With Facebook's announcement of a new digital global currency, Libra, heightened attention from investors, regulators and customers will focus on banks' innovations in payments in the months ahead.</p><p>Dimon certainly knew it was coming, as he told us in June: \"You've got Silicon Valley putting tens of billions a year into fintech and then you've got the big technology companies. They're coming in some fashion. It may not be a frontal challenge, but they all want to be in payments, they all want to hold money.\"</p><p>Will his bank be ready?</p><p>\"A coin, like JPM Coin, could work on the network,\" Georgakopoulos says, \"as a means for payments to operate 24/7 and 365 days a year that removes worries about missing cut-off times while minimizing transaction costs.\"</p><p>It sounds almost as if a long-term vision is about to become reality. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1g5v0nsl8vhq9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP0-SX21-JD1P-T09H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Published in February 2020, the book is as timely as it is easy to read. Although it missed out on encompassing the March 2020 crash, the lessons and advice in the book are timeless.\u00a0<br/>If anything, the book looks months if not years into the horizon, touching on not the latest investment trends but existential questions relating to monetary policy, public spending, economic theory, and sound investing. The main thesis of the book is that the United States as well as the rest of the modern world is preparing itself for an incredibly painful financial crisis due to a long legacy of poor policymaking and market interference.</p><p><br/>Essentially, we are in the midst of one of the largest financial bubbles in history and our leaders lack the political will to control it. For some, the book may come off as an overly pessimistic market bear pitch preaching impending doom that never comes. Even if that is the case, the book still features a vast wealth of bluntly spoken economic knowledge that can serve anybody from a new investor to a central banker.\u00a0<br/>Understanding Financial Crashes\u00a0<br/>Recessions play an essential role in the economy. They are a natural and healthy correction where poor investments fail and eventually recalibrate to good investments. The problem comes when governments, in their quest to create everlasting growth, try to interfere with this natural process; like trying to prevent death or stop an infectious disease. The authors use many analogies to frat parties to describe recessions and government policy. Although that is certainly a fine metaphor, it may be a little too realistic.\u00a0<br/>Imagine the market as a party. The boom cycle, characterized by upward financial growth is when everyone is drinking and having a good time. People are making investments, spending money, and making money. Eventually, people drink a little too much and they wake up hungover in the morning. That\u2019s the bust cycle or a recession, characterized by downward financial growth. Those who were responsible with their money often escaped with little losses, i.e. they were responsible with their liquor consumption the night before and weren\u2019t hungover.\u00a0<br/>Those who drank too much will be hungover, i.e. making way too many risky investments and overexposing themselves to dangerous assets. There is nothing wrong with this dynamic on its own, as hangovers are natural and they happen to the best of us.\u00a0<br/>Ideally, you would want a relatively stable financial market characterized by mild booms and busts. Think of a nice dinner party; you won\u2019t be having the time of your life but nobody is getting alcohol poisoning either.\u00a0<br/>You get a financial crisis when things start getting out of hand. Perhaps there is an unprecedented level of speculation or government manipulation that has created artificial as well as unsustainable incentives that distort investors\u2019 abilities to make sound decisions.<br/>The authors specifically reference the Dotcom Bubble where investors frantically hopped on trendy and unproven internet-based companies. Another example is the 2008 Housing Crisis which former BB&amp;T; executive John Allison explains was caused largely in part by a large amount of government-created incentives and interference that led to an unnatural rate of growth that was disastrously unsustainable.\u00a0<br/>Central Bank Manipulation\u00a0<br/>The authors continue with the party analogy when describing the role and influence of central banks, a recent player in the market whose influence has grown to unprecedented levels. Essentially central banks, with their ability to manipulate the money supply, are the uncles who bring the booze to the party. Responsible central bank leaders know how to responsibly monitor the rate of economic growth. The authors note,<br/>\u201cFederal Reserve Chairmen William Martin and Paul Volcker deserve equal note for exercising unpopular courage by standing up to bull-market temptations. In 1958, Martin took away Wall Street\u2019s \u201ceasy money\u201d punchbowl as soon as he saw that an economic recovery had morphed into greedy, Wall Street speculation and a dangerously overvalued stock market.\u201d<br/>However, most central bankers are not like the ones mentioned above. They continue to indulge in complicated stimulus measures and irresponsible monetary policy much like an uncle who just keeps giving liquor to the frat boys.\u00a0<br/>By keeping interest rates low for longer than they need to be, central banks not only encourage reckless investing but weaken their ability to react in a recession. AIER has published an article detailing how highly unorthodox practices at the European Central Bank, such as negative interest rates are causing havoc in the European economy.<br/>Boom and bust cycles much like supply and demand have a natural equilibrium that is self-regulating. The problem comes when an outside actor that is completely impervious to market forces attempts to manipulate the market. ASU Professor Scott Scheall explains in his latest book that the knowledge problem is associated with political solutions as opposed to market-based ones. In many instances, governments simply lack the political courage to allow recessions to occur naturally and let bad actors fail. They\u2019d rather kick the can down the road, dooming future generations to volatility if not devastation.\u00a0<br/>The authors point to an example of such behavior when they cite that<br/>\u201cGE\u2019s (General Electric) dive from $50 to $10 was based on the fact that its finance company\u2019s earnings were essentially $600B of risky, illiquid assets propped up by mountains of debt ($800B) and hot money leverage\u2026 Did the company learn the necessary lessons of reckless speculation in the fall from its 40x valuation peaks? No. Instead, GE\u2019s CEO took a bailout.\u201d<br/>The market is full of these scenarios where governments artificially prop up failing companies by pumping trillions of dollars into the economy through quantitative easing and other experimental monetary policies. This creates a dynamic where companies are not really creating value but are simply propped up by an unstable house of cards composed of overly complicated interventions. The worst part is that it only prolongs the inevitable and makes the downturn even worse. This creates a vicious cycle where the government can\u2019t afford to not perform a bailout as doing so may substantially harm the economy. This not only incentivizes poor behavior but perpetually adds to the already overbearing pile of problems .\u00a0<br/>Such behavior is now the norm all across the world so if the crash comes it will not be a local crisis, but a global catastrophe.\u00a0<br/>Looking at Market Signals\u00a0<br/>The authors run a website called Signals Matter where their main focus is providing sound investing advice on the basis of strong information and conservative strategies. Part of that strategy is paying attention to signals in the market and not being caught flat-footed.<br/>The authors cite this graph multiple times throughout their book to drive home the point that they believe we are in the midst of a central bank-driven bubble. As seen, they mark the Dot.com Bubble as well as the Subprime bubble. In the book, they mark the very top right corner as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u201cEverything Bubble.\u201d</emphasis> As indicated, it is driven in large part by central banking stimulus into the economy, propping up companies and stocks that don\u2019t reflect productive activity. Throughout the book, the authors cite a plethora of graphs to drive home their various points but their main focus is on market signals.\u00a0<br/>From this graph it is clear that bubbles have a certain look to them, although it may not be clear exactly how they look; you know one when you see one. Unnatural expansions crash unnaturally hard and central banks have been fueling a concerning amount of artificial expansion.<br/>Basic common sense should make us step back and wonder if stock markets are supposed to grow this fast. We can see a scaled-down example as recently as the entire month of September. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, as the Main Street economy suffered massive losses, the stock market (mainly big tech companies) soared in value. However, the reckoning has come as the entire month of September has been characterized by a considerable stock selloff.\u00a0<br/>We can see that over the course of the 20th century, the market has become more volatile. A large part of this can be explained by the increasing power and activity of central banks. At the turn of the 20th century, we see the beginning of more interventionist style policies such as the creation of the US Federal Reserve in 1913. FDR took the US off the gold standard in 1933 via executive order and the advent of an overall drastically larger government.<br/>The key takeaway is that incompetent and overly involved government intervention in the money supply, as well as the market, has to lead to increased extremes in both growth and retraction. If you look at the current state of the market, which is characterized by trillions of dollars in stimulus spending, corporate bailouts, and low interest rates you should think of it like a party featuring a massive amount of hard liquor as well as illicit substances. It won\u2019t end well.\u00a0<br/>Another key signal the authors highlight is the disconnect between Wall Street and the rest of the economy. Although the stock market is supposed to mirror investor confidence rather than the performance of the actual economy, there comes a point where it seems like things are a little too disconnected. This is especially true when we consider the amount of credit expansion and experimental monetary policies being implemented by governments across the world. With the amount of intervention and stimulus that we are seeing today, it might actually be more surprising if Wall Street was actually correlated with the economy.<br/>The authors use this graph to illustrate their point about the utter disconnect between the financial sector and the actual economy. They point out deceptive bookkeeping schemes that are totally permitted by the SEC as well as misleading methodology utilized by the government to calculate things like unemployment. They write that\u00a0<br/>\u201cThat\u2019s why the Fed and the Bureau of Labor Statistics have deliberately lied to us for years about \u201croaring GDP growth\u201d and \u201ccontained inflation.\u201d With markets skyrocketing on debt, our actual GDP since the 2008 crisis has only annualized at a pathetic rate of 2%. Thus we have debt (and hence markets and Fed balance sheets) skyrocketing, while GDP flatlines \u2013 a classic sign of a rigged-to-fail market.\u201d<br/>The Federal Reserve is out on a spending spree with its buddies on Wall Street using money that seemingly came out of thin air. This is because the Fed is a sovereign money creator that can print money at will. Without being collateralized to something like the gold standard, such behavior is theoretically infinite, but the consequences are just as high. The authors consistently warn the reader throughout the book to be on the lookout for such disconnects, whether it be national economies or individual stocks. Clever bookkeeping, artificial credit, and market hype can produce numbers that are seemingly too good to be true. When the charade is up, investors react accordingly.\u00a0<br/>A market can only run so long on government-created debt; actual productive activity is needed for long term sustainability.<br/>The Consequences\u00a0<br/>The obvious thing that can happen if these predictions come true is that people will lose a lot of money, the economy will fall into a savage recession, and political upheaval will likely ensue. This is the stark picture that details the likely consequences of a bubble pop of this size and a government that values short-term performance over long-term stability.\u00a0<br/>The authors do acknowledge that markets seem to be resilient and with time they return. However, they also point out that such a massive monetary and financial reckoning hit Japan around 1989. Although the Nikkei has returned to its previous levels, that recovery took 30 years. One can only imagine the consequences of a global crisis of this magnitude.<br/>Key Takeaways<br/>The book goes into so much detail and covers so much ground that this review only touches on the most general parts. It even offers some general investment advice and goes into detail about various assets such as bonds, precious metals, and so on. Regardless of whether the predictions in the book come true, it offers a timeless set of sound economic principles that can serve both investors and governments who are truly the ones who should heed this message.<br/>The big picture is that sound economics matters. Governments as well as individual investors should be attuned to the basic foundations of free market capitalism. Believing we can break free of the natural cycles of the market is much like trying to conquer nature. Nature always wins in the long run.<br/>At the end of the day, we should all learn from history. We have seen which monetary policies work and which ones fail. It might not be popular to take away the drugs and alcohol at the party, but you might save lives by doing so. We know what a drunk looks like and we know an unsustainable market when we see one. Eventually there are consequences for risky behavior. Relying on proven principles may not be as glorious or exciting but it will guarantee we actually come out in one piece.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-114633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XM-PH81-DY1R-B0C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2240\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Books</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

AI rising: The promise of artificial intelligence is almost as great as its potential pitfalls, and Congress, already feeling burned by Big Tech, is looking at regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Huawei v. U.S.: The Chinese telecom giant is fighting back against the U.S. government in federal court, arguing Congress broke the law when it passed legislation singling out Huawei.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. Mueller's warning: Lost in the special counsel's statements last week was a stark admonishment aimed at all Americans: Pay attention to Russian election interference, which, in his words was a \"concerted attack on our political system\" involving \"multiple\" and \"systematic\" efforts, using \"sophisticated cybertechniques.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">4. Scan ban: Democrats and Republicans in both chambers of Congress are moving toward legislation that would temporarily ban the use of facial recognition technology.</p><p>5. Greenbacks gone? Congress is contemplating an American future in which cryptocurrency -- not cash -- is the coin of the realm, with the Congressional Research Service diving into the topic in a new report.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Government looks to grapple with artificial intelligence before it's too late </p><p>Artificial intelligence has helped authorities locate missing children, but it often has trouble identifying people of color. It can help detect cancer, but might recommend an ineffective cure. Police can use it to track criminals, but it can aid foreign enemies seeking to target voters and influence elections. It can make us more efficient while simultaneously perpetuating longstanding biases.</p><p>On the cover of today's CQ Magazine, my colleagues Gopal Ratnam and Kate Ackley take stock of the current moment in artificial intelligence, a technology that teaches machines to recognize complex patterns and make decisions based on them  -  much like humans do.</p><p>Gopal and Kate explore how the potentially profound benefits of artificial intelligence are balanced by the damaging, even dangerous, possible downsides.</p><p>For example, police in New Delhi last year traced 2,930 missing children in four days by using an experimental facial recognition technology that identified them by examining a database of 45,000 kids living in shelters and homes. At the same time, a facial recognition tool developed by Amazon and tested by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as having been arrested for a crime. The program disproportionately picked out African-American lawmakers including civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis.</p><p>Lawmakers and regulators still grappling with the downsides of the internet and social media eras, including the loss of privacy, criminal hacking and data breaches, are now trying to see if they can mitigate some of the perils of AI through regulation. </p><p>Industry groups, lobbyists and unions are angling to shape the debate over regulations affecting a technology that could one day lead to more jobs lost to automation. Civil rights groups and some technologists are calling for greater oversight to prevent bias and discriminatory practices.</p><p>Determining the way forward is also complicated since artificial intelligence has emerged from technology and data unhampered by restrictions on privacy and use, says Jason Schulz, a law professor at the New York University who also oversees law and policy for the university's AI Now Institute.</p><p>\"We are now trying to figure out whether the scaffolding we have for the internet era is sufficient for AI or do we need a whole new foundation,\" he says.</p><p>Read Gopal and Kate's full story here. </p><p>2. Huawei says Congress overreached with federal contracting ban</p><p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies is facing a barrage of legal and regulatory actions threatening its access to U.S. markets, but now it's fighting back, reports Mark Bocchetti.</p><p>In a new lawsuit, the company is arguing legislation passed by Congress to ban Huawei from contracting with the federal government or military is an unconstitutional bill of attainder. In other words, the government broke the law by singling out Huawei, the company is arguing. </p><p>The fiscal 2019 defense authorization law (PL 115-232) prohibits federal agencies from buying, or contracting with companies that use, certain Huawei equipment and services. The company contends Congress violated Article I of the Constitution by engaging in a \"trial by legislature.\"</p><p>\"In the way that it targets, adjudicates facts about, and sanctions Huawei, Section 889 so accumulates all governmental powers in one body, and produces the very tyranny which the framers feared,\" Huawei lawyers contend in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Texas. Section 889 refers to the portion of the 2019 law that mentions Huawei.</p><p>The defense team for the Chinese telecommunications provider filed a motion for summary judgment Wednesday, seeking a decision from the court solely on the basis of the law, without a fact-finding stage. The judge will hear arguments Sept. 19.</p><p>Mark has more on the Huawei suit here.</p><p>3. Mueller departs with warning: Don't forget Russia's election interference</p><p>In the aftermath of Special Counsel Robert Mueller III's public statements on his Russia investigation last week, much of the debate hinged on whether his words had furthered the case for impeaching President Donald Trump. That response was largely inevitable, though probably not what Mueller hoped for.</p><p>Indeed, the former FBI Director concluded his remarks with a stern warning: Pay attention to what Russia did in the 2016 presidential election, and don't let it happen again.</p><p>\"I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments -- that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election,\" Mueller said Wednesday at the Justice Department, his first public remarks since taking over the nearly two-year investigation. \"That allegation deserves the attention of every American.\"</p><p>Yet, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been divided for most of the past year on how to address the weaknesses in the U.S. election system that were exploited by Russia in 2016 and again in 2018, even as other countries attempt to copy Moscow's playbook.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly tried to cast doubt on Mueller's findings, saying the interference could have come from Russia, China or other countries. He has also said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials that Moscow orchestrated an attack on U.S. elections, contradicting the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies and Mueller's findings.</p><p>For the most part, lawmakers in both parties agree America's voting machines and their support systems, including voter registration and vote-tallying computers, are outdated and lacking in basic security measures. But they are divided over how to fix the problem.</p><p>Democrats have been pushing for as much as a $1 billion infusion of federal grants -- in addition to the $380 million Congress appropriated in fiscal 2018 -- to states to upgrade voting machines and train officials in cybersecurity measures, but Republicans have balked at the proposal.</p><p>Gopal, Doug Sword and yours truly have more on this story here. </p><p>4. Cummings to hold second facial recognition hearing Tuesday</p><p>At a House hearing on facial recognition last month, privacy activists, constitutional scholars and civil rights advocates condemned the rise and use of the technology by the government as invasive and possibly illegal, and won plaudits from lawmakers who support temporarily banning it.</p><p>At a second hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee scheduled for Tuesday, law enforcement officials will have a chance to tell their side of the story. They are likely to tell the committee success stories about the technology, such as how it helped police in Maryland catch Jarrod Warren Ramos, who killed five people in a mass shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis last June.</p><p>But it may be too late. Lawmakers seem to have already made up their minds when it comes to facial recognition, which they say could be turned on any American exercising their constitutional rights.</p><p>\"You could be at a rally supporting gun rights or protesting gun violence,\" Cummings said at last month's hearing. \"You could be marching for the right to life or a woman's right to choose.

Report to Congress ponders a future of cryptocurrency over cash</p><p>A new report by the Congressional Research Service examining the decline in cash usage in the United States also covers the potential rise of alternative payment systems, including bitcoin or other digital assets, in the purchase of goods and services, reports Steven Harras.</p><p>The inclusion of cryptocurrency in a report produced by CRS, which studies any issue of interest to Congress, suggests such payment systems are gaining steam as lawmakers introduce legislation that would require stores still to take cash and at the same time examine the impact of new financial technologies, or fintech.</p><p>Although the amount of currency in circulation has increased over the past 20 years, Federal Reserve studies suggest the use of cash in payments may be dropping, according to the CRS report, issued May 10. Just how much may be a matter of debate, but the migration away from cash transactions at retail stores is self-evident. </p><p>So far, the move has been largely in favor of what the CRS refers to as \"traditional noncash payment systems\" such as credit cards and debit cards. And the report even includes mobile payment apps, of which there are many and no clearly established market leaders, in the category of \"traditional.\"</p><p>The question facing businesses, policymakers, consumers and the economy at large is how significant a role alternative channels such as digital currencies will play in the future of the U.S. retail payments system. </p><p>The use of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and distributed ledgers to make payments in the United States is \"quite rare relative to cash and traditional systems,\" the report states. While there is a public interest in and demand for some digital currencies, analyses indicate they are not being widely used and accepted as payment for goods and services, \"but rather as investment vehicles.\"</p><p>Despite the limited uptake so far, some believe they will be at least part of the payment options in the future.</p><p>\"While cryptocurrencies may not supplant traditional payments aggressively in the near term, the value of blockchain and innovative approaches to the payments industry extends beyond [government] currency replacement,\" said Amy Zirkle, interim CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association, a Washington-based trade group for the payments technology industry.</p><p>Steven has more on the future of cryptocurrency here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

This plan, announced last week, is part of its settlement agreement with the civil rights groups that filed suits against the company over the past few years. The substantive terms are not radical. But they outline a basic framework for how policymakers might begin thinking about reforming big tech in ways that are suited to our times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ever since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race\">reporting</url> revealed in October of 2016 that Facebookallowed advertisers to exclude users by race, the company has denied any legal wrongdoing. If there is a problem under law, its leaders have said, it is with advertisers. That is why Facebookcould claim that it was attending to discrimination by requiring advertisers to certify that they were not violating civil rights laws.</p><p>But this was always unconvincing because until last week, Facebookmade it possible for advertisers to discriminate against users if they fell into a \u201cmulticultural affinity\u201d classification like \u201cMundo Hispanico\u201d or \u201cHispanic.\u201d These categories are obvious proxies for race, ethnicity and religion. While people do not have to be a member of a particular group to fall into one of these classifications, the likelihood that they do is significant enough to justify them. This is, in part, why HUD <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/facebook-hud-discrimination.html\">filed a lawsuit</url> against the company.</p><p>What is important here is that Facebookdoes not explicitly ask for users\u2019 race or ethnicity to define this groups. Instead it creates them out of the enormous amounts of data that it collects, like friend networks, \u201clikes,\u201d location, in-app browsing patterns, as well as creepy, innocuous information like offline browsing activity, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/20/17254312/facebook-shadow-profiles-data-collection-non-users-mark-zuckerberg\">even of people without accounts</url>.</p><p>Of course, race and ethnicity have always been valuable signals for marketers. You would expect that El Pa\u00eds would target its programming to Latinos and that MAC would market the darker shades of its makeup to African-American women.</p><p>Building managers and employers could also use the \u201cmulticultural affinity\u201d feature to discriminate against members of racial minority groups and older people in their ads about housing and jobs. </p><p>Here is the catch: Magazine publishers and cosmetics companies may legally target potential customers on the basis of such traits, but civil rights laws plainly forbid large building owners to indicate such information in ads about housing and employment.</p><p>Under the settlement, Facebookdid not admit to wrongdoing, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/facebook-discrimination-ads.html\">it did agree</url> to no longer make gender, age or \u201cmulticultural affinity\u201d targeting available to advertisers in markets for housing, employment, and credit. It also agreed to administer a separate new portal for ads for those areas, in which advertisers would never have the option to exclude or include audiences on the basis of traits like race, sex, age and proxies for those traits like ZIP code. </p><p>The settlement also prohibits Facebookfrom continuing to use race and other protected categories in \u201clook-alike\u201d targeting in housing, employment and credit markets. That technique enables an advertiser to reach users whose characteristics resemble those of its existing customers. In other words, the broker for a co-op building that is predominantly white and middle-aged can no longer use the \u201clook-alike\u201d feature to post an apartment opening because it would effectively discriminate against people who do not fit the mold.</p><p>The devil will be in the details of execution, of course, but with these settlement terms, we have come a long way since Facebook\u2019s flat denials. The civil rights groups who filed the litigation will be monitoring the effects of Facebook\u2019s changes for the next few years. </p><p>Still, the reforms embodied in the settlement are hardly enough. First, even if Facebooksubstantially narrows the scope of targeting, there is no reason to believe that its algorithms might not revert to discriminatory ad distribution patterns. How will Facebookrespond when, for example, its algorithms \u201clearn\u201d that mostly younger white men click through a housing advertisement in a predominantly white neighborhood?</p><p>We might suspect that Facebookcould moderate against the possibility of algorithmic bias in instances like that by just editing the algorithm. But this points to another limitation in the agreement: Facebookdoes not have to be transparent about the actual workings of its algorithms.</p><p>Presumably, the lawsuit that HUD filed Thursday will ensure that a watchful eye remains on the company\u2019s advertising practices. The best the settlement does on the question of transparency is provide a process through which civil rights groups and researchers may intermittently evaluate the ways in which Facebookadministers ads. It also requires Facebookto develop another portal through which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecbalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ex.-1-Settlement-Agreement-and-General-Release-with-Exhibit-A-dkt-66-2-3-19-19-00368742x9CCC2.pdf\">all users may search and review all housing advertisements</url>, whether or not Facebookserves them to their news feeds. But ultimately, none of these transparency reforms will ensure that Facebook\u2019s algorithms will stop engaging in illegal discrimination.</p><p>Despite these limitations, there is much in the settlement that is worth applauding. At a minimum, it sets out the blueprint for how to regulate big tech going forward.</p><p>For one, it acknowledges that Facebookcan separate parts of its advertising service from other parts of its vast platform. It is possible to impose structural limits on how it and other big tech companies like Google and Amazon leverage the two-sided markets that they straddle. In light of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/technology/google-facebook-amazon-antitrust.html\">recent proposals by at least one presidential candidate</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html\">excellent legal scholarship</url> on the question, this aspect of the agreement should encourage policymakers to plausibly call for structural fixes to the services that big tech provides. Policymakers should consider limitations on what online companies may do with user data after they collect it, like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/germany-facebook-data.html\">the requirements of Europe\u2019s new data protection law</url>.</p><p>The other important lesson from the settlement is not about any of its specific terms. It is that policymakers should ensure that Facebookand other big tech companies continue to contemplate the real threat of litigation. The lawyers who represented plaintiffs filed complaints that plausibly forced Facebookto revamp its powerful advertising business model. But this is a rare case.</p><p>Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, online intermediaries have enjoyed a broad immunity from liability for the illicit online conduct of their users and advertisers. Boosters of this generous protection explain that requiring online companies to moderate the tons of data coursing through their servers would impose a heavy burden. That burden, they argue, would encourage companies to stifle more expressive conduct than the law requires. This view resonated widely in the mid-1990s, when many people believed that the internet was the last best chance for an open and democratic forum for user-generated content. But as we read <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html\">story</url> after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html\">story</url> about intermediaries\u2019 craven       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/discriminatory-designs-user-data\">designs on user data</url>, this view must give way to a fresh approach.</p><p>The internet is no longer just a medium for newsgroups and electronic bulletin boards, which were the conduits for authentic user-generated content that the drafters of the C.D.A. had in mind two decades ago. Today, intermediaries design services that control practically all aspects of users\u2019 online experiences. Targeted advertising is just one example. We should accordingly expect them to take far more responsibility for what happens on their platforms.</p><p>The protection under the C.D.A. demonstrably lulled Facebookinto complacency. Its managers did not feel the urgency to adequately answer complaints that its advertising service (not just advertisers) violated civil rights laws until plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims showed the world how. <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3007720\">Narrowing the scope of protection under the C.D.A</url>. would help to make sure that Facebookand influential companies like it are      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2997141\">beholden to the laws that protect</url> the most vulnerable among us, or at least stay vigilant to the cause. Details for such reform are not easy to sort out. This settlement is a good start.</p><p>Mr. Sylvain is a professor at Fordham Law School.

I'm Becky Anderson, live for you from London. And we start this hour some with choice words from the President of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am the chosen one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Taken alone, maybe not so unusual for this President to a self- aggrandizing turn of phrase on his fitness to confront China on trade. But that strange almost biblical proclamation was not an isolated force. Earlier, he basked in the praise of a right-wing conspiracy theorist who called him the second coming of God. He told a World War II hero that he wanted to award himself the Medal of Honor. And finally, he put a bow on the day, by contradicting his own statements on gun reform and taxes.</p><p>Should we just chalk this up to Trump being Trump or something more. \"New York Times\" quotes former administration officials who say the President's erratic behavior stems from new pressures. Fears of an economic recession getting louder, potentially harming his re-election campaign.</p><p>Let's get to Joe Johns at the White House. Joe, I guess there is a question here which needs answering. Is there method in what many see as the U.S. President's madness at present?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well frankly no one knows what's in the mind of President Trump, Becky, as you know. And we've tried to read tea leaves before. But the \"New York Times\" article there may be onto something in that as we approach an election year, so many things that might not be deemed political can be seen through a political lens.</p><p>For example, not just questions about the economy but also there's a lot of talk -- as you mentioned at the top there -- about religion. There's been talk about gun control and the NRA. Gun control as well as Evangelical people as well as Catholics helped propel the election of Donald Trump in 2016. And now there are concerns from polls and other places that he might have more trouble with those groups this year, that may be part of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHNS (voice-over): President Trump seizing the spotlight, sending mixed messages and contradicting himself on issues like gun legislation.</p><p>Oh, I happen to have protect for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.</p><p>JOHNS: Yet sources tell CNN, Trump had a long conversation with NRA leadership the day before and is standing by gun lobbyists.</p><p>TRUMP: We also have to remember the gun doesn't pull the trigger, a person does. And we have great mental illness.</p><p>JOHNS: The President also stoking outrage by repeating an anti-Semitic trope.</p><p>TRUMP: If you vote for a Democratic, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.</p><p>JOHNS: Claiming this about previous criticism.</p><p>TRUMP: It's only anti-Semitic in your head.</p><p>JOHNS: President Trump also tweeting out a comment from a conservative conspiracy theorist writing. Thank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words. President Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world not just America. Like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.</p><p>The President going as far as using biblical terms to describe himself.</p><p>TRUMP: I'm the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So I'm taking on China. I'm taking on China on trade. And you know what? We're winning.</p><p>JOHNS: And taking aim once again at his predecessor.</p><p>TRUMP: So Russia outsmarted President Obama. President Obama and others brought the families apart. But I'm the one that kept the families together.</p><p>JOHNS: But that's just not true. Separations were rare under the Obama administration. The Trump administration has only intensified family separations at the border. Also, on immigration, the President ramped up rhetoric on constitutionally guaranteed birth right citizenship.</p><p>TRUMP: You walk over the border, have a baby. Congratulations, the baby is now a U.S. citizen. We are looking at birth right citizenship very seriously. It's frankly ridiculous.</p><p>JOHNS: The question of a possible recession.</p><p>TRUMP: I'm not looking at a tax cut now. We don't need it. We have a strong economy.</p><p>JOHNS: That's not what Trump said Tuesday.</p><p>[11:05:00] TRUMP: Payroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that.</p><p>JOHNS: And the President's using a familiar insult to again attack Denmark's Prime Minister after she dismissed his idea of buying Greenland.</p><p>TRUMP: I thought the Prime Minister's statement that it was absurd, it was an absurd idea was nasty. I thought it was inappropriate statement. All she had to say is no, we wouldn't be interested.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHNS: The Danish Prime Minister joins a long list of political opponents or critics of the President who have been referred to as nasty. That includes Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the President's opponent in the last election here in the United States, as well as Elizabeth Warren, who is a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts. But not just women, a number of men have been described as nasty by the President as well -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Joe Johns out of Washington for you. Thank you, Joe.</p><p>Well, Mr. Trump doubling down on his claim that American Jews are being disloyal, he says, to Israel if they vote for Democrats. Let me remind you of exactly what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well critics calling out the U.S. President, accusing him of regurgitating anti-Semitic tropes. The Jewish Democratic Council of America says he's trying to weaponize and politicize anti-Semitism for political gain. Here is how he responded when a reporter challenged him on what he's been saying.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If Jews vote for Democrats, are they being disloyal to Israel is that what you're saying?</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, I say so, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Isn't that anti-Semitic?</p><p>No, no, no. It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Two guests join us to discuss all of this now. CNN political commentators Ben Ferguson and Peter Beinart. Ben, accusations of disloyalty have been made against Jews including Europe in the 1930s and the AP sort of reporting on this today as others. Fact is, Ben, as the AP point out, false charges of disloyalty have led to Jews being murdered, jailed and tortured. Do you support the U.S. President trading in anti- Semitic stereotypes?</p><p>BEN FERGUSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't think he's trading anti- Semitic stereotyping. I think he is being honest about the reality now of the Democratic Party (INAUDIBLE) they will refuse to condemn their own members who attack Israel as being racist. Those are the words of Representative Tlaib. Omar and Tlaib they both (INAUDIBLE) for Israel and say they are repressed (INAUDIBLE) racist. Say that they are bullied. That they shouldn't by on (INAUDIBLE) they are on.</p><p>ANDERSON: All right. We're losing you, Ben. So I'm just going to see whether we can sort out your microphone. Meantime, let's get to you, Peter. I mean, you heard enough of what Ben just suggested. These aren't anti-Semitic stereotypes or tropes, so get over it. Is effectively what he said.</p><p>PETER BEINART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The odd thing about Donald Trump is he seems to genuinely have a difficulty in distinguishing between American Jews and Israelis. This is not the first time. He called in a speech a couple years ago to a Republican Jewish group. He referred to them as -- to Benjamin Netanyahu as your Prime Minister. At the White House Hanukkah party last year, he's said that Mike Pence loves your country -- speaking to the Jewish group -- and also this country. As if Israel was their country.</p><p>American Jews live in the United States. We are proud citizens of the United States. We may have affinity for Israel. Just as Irish Americans have affinity for Ireland. But the danger here is I'm not getting inside Donald Trump's head to say whether he is an anti-Semite. I have no idea what that man is thinking a lot of the time. But when you suggest that America is not really our country.</p><p>Just like if you're a member with the Mexican American judge, Gonzalo Curiel, he said he couldn't be an unbiased because he was, quote, a Mexican. Curiel was born in Indiana. He was a Mexican American descent.</p><p>Or when he says Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Rashida Tlaib, who were born in the United States, should go back where they came from. The idea is that he doesn't at some deep level recognize that people who are not white and not Christian are still fully American.</p><p>ANDERSON: This from the Republican Jewish Coalition. Quote. It shows a great deal of disloyalty to oneself to defend a party that protects, emboldens, they say, people that hate you for your religion. Peter, I've got you back, Ben, which is fantastic. Peter and to you, Ben, let's look at polling, shall we, from the Pew Research Center. Because I want to get to the heart of why we think Donald Trump is doing what he is doing at present. In 2018 midterm election, nearly 8 in 10 Jews vote Democratic. So, Peter, what is he really trying to accomplish here?</p><p>[11:10:04] BEINART: I don't think there's any significant chance that the percentage of American Jews voting for the Republican Party is going to change. American Jews have been essentially voting Democratic since literally the days of Franklin Roosevelt. And the reason is -- and this is what Donald Trump and maybe my friend here Ben don't understand -- American Jews in our bones as a historically oppressed marginalized group identify with groups and people that are underdogs and that are oppressed. Because we know that ultimately our fate is bound up with theirs.</p><p>This narrow exclusivist bigoted vision of national identity that Donald Trump and many of the Republican Party pedal is dangerous for Jews. Has been dangerous throughout history. A total of 36 times says know the heart of the stranger because we are strangers in the land of Egypt.</p><p>FERGUSON: Peter, I've got my mike backup.</p><p>ANDERSON: OK, go on, Ben.</p><p>FERGUSON: Just give me a moment here to respond. There's a lot of things that you said. First off, the reality is what Donald Trump is saying and making clear to the American people is the Democratic Party is not the same friend of Israel that they're claiming. If they were, they would be condemning the remarks that have come from Democratic members of Congress who have referred to Israel as a racist oppressive state. They've also stood side by side with organizations that support Hamas and Hezbollah and terrorist groups that actually do terrorist actions against Israel.</p><p>The President's point that he's making here is we are friends with Israel and these two Congresswomen, for example, are not friends of Israel. They're attacking Israel. They're wanting to de-fund Israel. So what he is saying to Democrats and what he's saying to people that are Jewish and vote Democratic, is we've seen clearly in these polls is, before you go in there and you vote for the Democratic Party thinking that they're actually advocates of Israel and Israel being an independent state and being safe, free and secure against terrorists around them is, look at the Democratic Party. They are not willing to stand up to their own members who are actively advocating for groups and terrorists and also de-funding Israel and funds that come from America and protect themselves.</p><p>ANDERSON: Ben, let me put this to you. Donald Trump says he is the chosen one, make of that what you will, but is it smart, appropriate for the U.S. President to be fanning this narrative, whether you agree with this position or not?</p><p>FERGUSON: Look, I think the President is tongue in cheek a lot on Twitter. I think his point was hey, I'm a friend of Israel. I'm defending Israel. I'm going to protect Israel. They are one of our strongest allies in the world, certainly in the Middle East. And we are going to stand side by side with Israel.</p><p>That's the reason why you saw many Israeli who love this President. His point is I'm the guy to protect and defend and make sure America has your back. I don't have a problem with the President saying that. I think it's a little bit too extreme to go to the point you say he is fanning something when in fact, he is a huge advocate for Israel. He's a huge fan of Israel. He is one of their biggest protectors and defenders in the world and he wants Israel to stand on their own two feet and be able to protect themselves and their interests without having to worry about terrorists coming after them.</p><p>ANDERSON: -- go on, Peter.</p><p>BEINART: What I think Ben is missing here, is that is it entirely possible to both be pro-Israel, pro-Zionist and also fan flames of anti-Semitism. Throughout history, Alfred Balfour, the British foreign minister, who signed the Balfour Declaration, partly supported the establishment of a Jewish state because he didn't want Jews in England. So Donald Trump may take positions the Israeli government loves, but when he implies that American Jews are loyal to another country and not loyal to the United States, that reverberates out in the country, right. We've already had a mass shooting of a man who basically assumed that Jews were disloyal to the country.</p><p>FERGUSON: Becky, let's be clear about this. What the President is saying here about this, is what he's saying is if you go out and ask people in America -- American citizens that are Jewish -- if they support and protect and want to defend Israel. Overwhelmingly they'll say yes in polls. The President's point is if you want to be loyal to Israel, if you want to protect Israel, which many of you claim that you want to do.</p><p>BEINART: But we're not loyal to Israel, Ben. We are American citizens. I don't understand why you can't --</p><p>FERGUSON: I clearly stated, I clearly stated -- because I knew you would say that. I said American citizens who are Jewish. The point is what he is saying is you want to protect and defend Israel. You're an American citizen. You are Jewish. You want to make sure that people in Israel are protected. Then you need to stand with me because I'm doing exactly that, and not what the Democratic Party is doing. Which is allowing members of their own party in Congress to actively advocate, to take away power, money, funding from Israel to protect themselves with arms deals. And also advocating for terrorist organizations in Palestine.</p><p>ANDERSON: OK, Peter I just to move on because I'm running out of time here. And it's fascinating to listen to the two of you. I just want to look, Peter, at the latest polling on President Trump.</p><p>[11:15:00] His overall approval rating has dipped three points since June. According to a new CNN poll, it's now 40 percent. More than half of Americans don't like how he's handling his job as President. So that has raised the narrative that what he is doing at present that potentially is playing distraction politics. Is he? Is the chosen one as he is self- declared playing distraction politics or something more at this point?</p><p>BEINART: I think we tend to impute too much strategy to what Donald Trump says. I think he is highly impulsive. And I think he likes to be at the center of the news cycle. Many things he's done that have put him in the center of attention, have clearly been bad politically. Like when he shut down the government. Donald Trump could win re-election. It's hard to defeat incumbent Presidents. But it's a mistake I think to think that there's some brilliant three-dimensional chess behind a lot of what he does. I think there just isn't. I don't think is that smart.</p><p>And with that we're going to leave it there. Thank you to you both. We'll have you back. Always a pleasure. Thank you. CNN political commentator's Ben Ferguson, Peter Beinart. I wish we had more time. But we've to get to these other stories in for you folks.</p><p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is taking his Brexit message to Paris where he continued his European tour. He is trying to make a case to the French President Emmanuel Macron for flexibility and a new approach as the U.K. seeks to remove what is known as the Irish back stop from the EU withdrawal agreement. President Macron, well he's having none of it.</p><p>It follows a meeting between Mr. Johnson and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Wednesday. Where she struck a more accommodating tone, giving the British Prime Minister 30 days to come up with an alternative plan. Melissa Bell has more for us from Paris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Becky, what Boris Johnson was hoping to find as he made his way around European capitals this week for the first time as the British Prime Minister, was what kind of room for negotiation there was, even at the late stage on the back stop. Essentially what he's been told -- with a slightly different tone from Berlin to Paris -- as ever Emmanuel Macron proving to be the more hardline European partner on this question of Brexit negotiations. Was that he had 30 days to come up with some kind of alternative, but that the agreement itself that was struck by his predecessor Theresa May and the rest of Europe was simply not up for re-negotiation.</p><p>Emmanuel Macron repeated it here in Paris today. We will not move very far from the basis of what's been agreed. All of this of course happens in the context of the G-7 meeting taking place this weekend. With Emmanuel Macron warning the British Prime Minister that what he risked in the case of no deal Brexit and by turning to the United States is becoming the country's vassal.</p><p>TRUMP: Well we do have a very special relationship. In fact I'll get that little piece of dandruff off.</p><p>BELL (voice-over): At first, the bromance seemed to flourish. The French President determined to be Donald Trump's friend in Europe, despite differences in both style and policy. But key issues, including threats of terrorists soon cooled the relationship. Now another European leader could prove a more natural ally for the American President and not just for pragmatic reasons but ideological ones too.</p><p>TRUMP: I spoke with Boris Johnson. I think he's going to be a great Prime Minister. I think he's going to do a fantastic job. I've known him. A lot of people know that we have a very good relationship. I think he'll be far superior.</p><p>BELL: The last time Donald Trump visited the United Kingdom Theresa May was Prime Minister. Now it is the Brexiteer, Boris Johnson, taking on Brexit negotiations with wary European partners. Stopping in Berlin Wednesday before heading to Paris to meet Macron and then onto the G-7 in Biarritz where the man some called the British Donald Trump will meet the actual Donald Trump. Two populist, certainly, but what about policy?</p><p>CHRISTIAN LEQUESNE POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, SCIENCES PO: If you look at the foreign policy positions of the United Kingdom on Iran, on Middle East, even on Russia, they are closer from Berlin and Paris than Washington, D.C.</p><p>BELL: But even more than Theresa May at the last G-7, Boris Johnson needs that special relationship with the United States rekindled post Brexit more than ever. At this week's G-7 in Biarritz, Trump and Johnson will be at the table. And even if there are divisions, there will be much that unites them, including a dislike of European Union.</p><p>(on camera): And perhaps in the greatest sign so far, Becky, that it is simply impossible to predict how this shifting dynamics are going to play out over the weekend in Biarritz, the French have ditched the long-term habit tradition of having a pre-signed communique agreed even before the leaders get together. This time it is anyone's guess what will be agreed - - Becky.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[11:20:00] ANDERSON: Melissa Bell in Paris for you.</p><p>Still to come this hour, we are live in Brazil as fires rage across the Amazon. Questions linger over just who is to blame for them. And the Brazilian President points his finger at one group you'd perhaps not expect. That coming up.</p><p>And --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Using information warfare --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cambridge Analytical claim to have 5,000 data points on every American voter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Are fair and democratic elections at risk? Directors of the \"Great Hack\" join me to discuss data and democracy. That after this.</p><p>ANDERSON: Right now while I talk to you, large parts of the Amazon are on fire. The largest rainforest engulfed in flames, sending plumes of smoke into the sky for three straight weeks. That is a record. The fires are so widespread that a lot of experts think they will have a significant impact on the fight against climate change.</p><p>Let's look at the new satellite images. This is one from European space agency's Sentinel satellite. This one from NASA shows how many fires were burning last week. And this picture from this week shows just how much the situation that gotten worse. Quite a worrying situation. But hasn't stopped Brazil's President from pointing the finger of blame against some of his favorite political targets. For more on this, let's get to Sao Paulo where Shasta Darlington joins me now. And from where earlier, Shasta, smoke from though fires plunging the city into darkness.</p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, JOURNALIST: That's right, Becky. This has really sparked a war of words with the President blaming NGOs, with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro. But what has been so crucial here is with the fires ravaging the Amazon at this alarming pace. We've really seen and felt it so far from home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DARLINGTON (voice-over): Brazil's largest city plunged into darkness. Black clouds filling the sky, blanketing Sao Paulo Monday afternoon. Thick smoke billowing from more than 2,700 kilometers away, where fires are consuming the world's largest rainforest.</p><p>The Amazon basin is burning at a record rate, according to Brazil's research center. More than 72,000 fires have scorched the country this year. And over 80 percent increase compared to the same period in 2018. Flames destroying one and a half football fields of rainforest every minute of every day.</p><p>[11:25:03] Smoke spreading across nearly half of Brazil, visible from space more than a week ago. Even spilling into neighboring Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay. Now the haze stretches across South America, spreading the East Atlantic Coast. Though fires are common here in Brazil's dry season, climate scientists say this is far from the norm. Instead environmentalists point to land raised at unprecedented levels, as a new government encourages industry to develop the Amazon region.</p><p>Brazil's right-wing President has brushed off environmental concerns as he vows to open the rainforest to business interest. Since he took office in January, rates of deforestation have soared as Jair Bolsonaro remains indignant to international criticism.</p><p>Take your money and reforest Germany. Bolsonaro bristled at Germany and Norway's decision to suspend funding to Brazil. Now his attention turns to wildfires surging at unprecedented rates, Bolsonaro is deflecting blame without evidence. He points to nongovernmental organizations.</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT: Regarding the fires in the Amazon, I am under the impression that it could have been set by the NGOs, because they had asked for money. What was their intention to bring about problems for Brazil?</p><p>DARLINGTON: Home to hundreds of indigenous tribes, the Amazon Rainforest is rich in wildlife and natural resources. Often called the lungs of the earth, the rainforest supplies 20 percent of the world's oxygen. If it burns to a point of no return, environmentalists warn it could turn into a dry savannah and begin emitting carbon instead. Plunging the planet ever deeper into a climate change crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DARLINGTON: Now that might not be imminent, but the flippant response by Bolsonaro has really just gotten a lot of backlash here with NGOs and environmentalists setting up a petition. More than 100 different organization have already signed it. Declaring Bolsonaro's comments lies and really urging some quick action to halt the forest fires and to reestablish some serious Amazon policy -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Thank you very much indeed. Shasta is in Sao Paulo for you on what is a very worrying story. For more on how these wildfires our planet, let's get you to our meteorologist Chad Myers at the CNN Weather Center. What have you got for us, Chad?</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Becky, I think It's important, the number was thrown out in the last little package. 20 percent of every oxygen molecule that's around you now, was generated in the Amazon. And if you burn that down, then all of a sudden you don't have as much O2 in the atmosphere.</p><p>74,000 fires so far to date. That's 85 percent more than last year and a show you that just date by date by date. Same year from 2012 all the way up to current. What we see now all the red spots are hot spots that the satellite sees. Now some of them may be power plants. But there aren't that many power plants in Brazil operating right now.</p><p>The carbon dioxide output from these fires surpasses all of the other years since we have been keeping track since 2003. And we're only about one- third of the way through fire season.</p><p>Something else to worry about. You know, when you look at the cars, and the trains, and the planes, and the buses, all of that transportation across the globe is only 14 percent of your greenhouse gas emissions. The rest is industry, energy, making electricity for homes, heating homes.</p><p>But 24 percent is something to do with agriculture. Whether It's growing livestock or for that matter taking away CO2 by just eating grass and plants and a grain fed economy, or a plant fed economy, and then if you burn down the O2, generating's -- which is the trees -- then all of a sudden your CO2 goes up and CO2 has just gone up. May, it was two. 2019 was 415 parts per million. And just about six or so years ago, we were well down below 350.</p><p>Now it is the dry season in Brazil. Things wouldn't be growing right now anyway. And farmers do burn farm -- the grasses, things to get ready for the new growing season. So we don't have much rainfall coming down. Probably less than 50 millimeters this month alone.</p><p>But It's truly the fires and smoke of what we're seeing here. This is 2000 -- I will make it bigger, I promise -- this was 2012 what the fires looked like in Brazil. This is going to be really fast. Let's go to 2013, fires down in the South and Paraguay. 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and now 2018 and 2019, so all of a sudden you see the number of fires, that's signatures on satellite, certainly up this year compared to what we've seen over the past five years -- Becky.</p><p>[11:30:07] ANDERSON: Chad's in the House. Thank you, Mr. Myers. Live from London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson.</p><p>Coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your interactions, your credit card swipes, web searches, locations, likes. They're all collected in real time into a trillion dollar a year industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Data is more valuable than oil. But is it more valuable than democracy? Directors of the \"Great Hack\" join me next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These platforms which were created to connect us have now been weaponized. It's impossible to know what is what because nothing is what it seems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Disinformation, election meddling, weaponized narratives. Those are the realities of our digital generation. Some of the tactics that according to some help fuel Brexit and perhaps gave added momentum to the self-declared chosen one, Donald Trump's ascent to the White House. Those two stories of course dominating our show today.</p><p>It's also the subject of a new and frankly terrifying Netflix documentary called \"The Great Hack\". Karim Amer and Jehane Noujim directed this film join me now from New York. Thank you for joining us, guys. This film focuses on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But has a wider message showing how our data can be harvested and weaponized. Is data overtaking democracy at this point?</p><p>KARIM AMER, CODIRECTOR, \"THE GREAT HACK\": I think it's safe to say that data has become the most valuable commodity on earth, and data is shaping our realities. And we don't really have a consensual relationship with data. And worse than that, we have a President of the supposed free and fair world that is propagating disinformation and using these platforms to weaponize the conversation further for his own white supremacist agenda.</p><p>ANDERSON: And we're going to come to the U.S. President in a moment. Jehane, before we do that, the EU have strict data privacy laws. France passed a fake news law. What are the solutions going forward?</p><p>[11:35:02] You've clearly done so much work ahead of and during the shooting of this great documentary. Did you come up with any solutions?</p><p>JEHANE NOUJIM, CODIRECTOR, \"THE GREAT HACK\": Well, you bring up a good solution with Europe. In Europe you have to opt in if you want your information shared, if you want your name or address shared. In the United States, you have to opt out. And It's very difficult to opt out.</p><p>ANDERSON: Let's talk about the self -- OK, I get what you're saying. I want to move this to Donald Trump. Because Karim, you brought him up. And he's calling himself the chosen one, so self-declared. Back in July former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Russia is poised to interfere in the next presidential campaign. Have a listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. WILLIAM HURD (R-TX): In your investigation did you think this was a single attempt by the Russians to get involved in our election or did you find evidence to suggest they'll try and do this again?</p><p>ROBERT MUELLER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL COUNSEL: It wasn't a single attempt, they're doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Karim, can 2020 be a fair election?</p><p>AMER: I mean, I wish it could be. I think it can if we take the right measures. But unfortunately as Mr. Mueller's testimony provides light to, and our film shows as well, both Russian interference and Cambridge Analytica point to one thing. Which is that Facebook has become a crime scene and Facebook has not taken the proper measures to protect the free and fair conversations that are happening. And allow audiences to understand the differences between misinformation and disinformation and operate a more healthy internet highway.</p><p>And I think that when we see the action taken in the U.S. government to prevent any legislation that could protect the integrity of the democratic process moving forward, it's very upsetting to see this. And the British Parliament ruled after a yearlong investigation into what was happening there that electoral laws are simply not fit for purpose and they called Facebook digital gangsters in their approach to handling the situation.</p><p>ANDERSON: You guys are behind \"The Square\", an Oscar award nominated documentary about Egypt's Tahrir square protests. I want to bring a little of that up for viewers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In all of this, it was just to remove him and put someone exactly like him in his place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Jehane, Facebook was a positive tool in the movement. It connected the isolated, the silenced. We watched it happen in front of our eyes. By the way, \"The Square\" is a fantastic documentary. What changed?</p><p>NOUJIM: Thank you. I think at that time we saw Facebook and Twitter as enablers of democracy and as tools. But they were tools to be able to gather people in public squares, not only in Tahrir but around the world. And now we've seen a pendulum swing. And so now we're seeing these same tools as potentially destructive of democracy.</p><p>AMER: It's been quite a shift.</p><p>NOUJIM: It has been an extreme shift where now we're looking at the fact that we have become the commodity. So we have to really think about what is for sale here. Is our democratic process for sale? Is our personal data for sale? And so, these are big questions that we have now and looking towards 2020.</p><p>AMER: And we also have to looked at how we've become complicit. You know, we've accepted that the admission fee to the connected world is giving up all our data unfiltered, without really understanding much about it. And I think that's become quite problematic.</p><p>And I think we're seeing a clamoring around the world of what the stakes are when you look at what's happening in China and Hong Kong with disinformation tactics and weapon eyes information. When you look at what's happening with the Rohingya crisis. And when you look at what's happening in the United States. And also you look at how we're complicit in continuing to give echo to a lot of the disinformation.</p><p>I mean, here we are talking about what the President is doing. Are we complicit in enabling him further in doing so? These are questions we have to address and talk about in this era where information warfare is the way of the future.</p><p>Where in \"The Square\", it was the public square that these platforms brought us together. Now It's in the cloud. So this is our public square that we have to figure out how we're going to regulate so that people aren't making a profit over dividing people and creating negative advertising.</p><p>[11:40:00] ANDERSON: You make a good point. To both of you then -- and I'll start with Karim. If there was one take away from the documentary or both -- you guys are making great content as I said. If there was one take away from work that you are doing, what would you hope it would be for your viewers or consumers?</p><p>AMER: I mean, my hope would be that people realize that big data has the ability to transform our lives for the better. We need technology to expand our capacity as humans but we need ethics to preserve our humanity. And we deserve a world in which we don't have to choose between the two. And that's why we're trying to tell stories about citizens around the world who are using these same tools to fight back and hack the system back.</p><p>Because this is a conversation about power. This isn't about data rights. This isn't just about elections. This is who controls what we see and who determines how we see it. And that is how we shape our own reality.</p><p>NOUJIM: I would say simply that if you're not thinking for yourself, somebody is going to be thinking for you.</p><p>ANDERSON: With that were going to leave it there. We thank you very much indeed for joining us.</p><p>NOUJIM: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: We're going to take a very short break. Back after this.</p><p>ANDERSON: In tonight's Parting Shots for you, it is an optical illusion that has got all of the internet buzzing. Look at this one way and it's a cute rabbit getting its nose scratched. Squint your eyes and it's a blackbird getting a bit of a head rub. The scientists at the University of Oslo in Norway is the trickster who opposed this puzzling piece. Now the reveal. This internet sensation is an African white necked raven. Named quite appropriately, mischief.</p><p>I'm Becky Anderson. That was CONNECT THE WORLD. Wherever you are, I hope you have a very good day. Thank you for watching from London.

Three separate hearings in three different congressional committees over the next two days will reveal the extent to which Big Tech has lost all its allies on Capitol Hill, and whether it will be able to escape real scrutiny of its practices anyway. Two of the three hearings concern Facebook's digital currency Libra, amid bipartisan consternation. </p><p>After Libra was announced last month, I expressed concern[1] that nobody in Washington was taking it very seriously. My concern has lifted. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers[2] that Libra raised 'serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.' This perhaps responded to bipartisan concern[3] that the Fed, by dragging its feet on a faster payment system, left a back door open for Facebook and other monopolists. If the Fed created a public digital wallet to exchange dollars, Facebook wouldn't have an entryway. 'We cannot allow giant companies to assert their power over critical public infrastructure,' wrote Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in a letter last week. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin piled on[4] yesterday, adding national security to the bill of particulars by suggesting Libra could finance terrorism[5]. 'We will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows,' Mnuchin said. Even Donald Trump added to this chorus with a notably articulate[6] series of tweets last week, asserting that Libra 'will have little standing or dependability' and arguing that it must obtain a banking charter to operate. Liberals share common cause[7] with Trump on this point. 'I'm suspicious,' says Representative Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia (D-IL), a member of the House Financial Services Committee that will hear from Libra representatives Wednesday. 'This sounds too good to be true. We will look at the growing role of Facebook and the possibility of creating a parallel system of banking without regulation.' Garcia will introduce legislation this week aimed at making it more difficult for banking and commerce to fall under the auspices of one company by closing a series of loopholes, including the 'industrial loan company[8]' designation that enables commercial firms to obtain a bank charter. The legislation would put some constraints on Libra, but a far more targeted bill[9] from Maxine Waters and committee leadership, called the 'Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act,' would outright prohibit large tech platforms from becoming financial institutions and operating digital currencies, with a fine of $1 million per day for any violations. 'My worry is that they're going to target communities like mine,' another Financial Services Committee member, Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), tells the Prospect. Indeed, Facebook has been selling Libra on the basis that it would increase financial inclusion for those without access to financial services. How it would do this is unclear, as those poor families would still not have the resources to acquire Libra. 'My residents are not going to be ready, they're not going to fully understand what the implications here are,' Tlaib says. Like Waters[10] and others on the committee, Tlaib favors a moratorium on Libra until regulators can give it more scrutiny. 'Facebook, what are your intentions here, what is the long-term plan here, and why are you only focused on these communities,' she says. With Trump staking out opposition as well, it's unclear whether anyone in the Senate Banking or House Financial Services committees will grant Libra a friendly reception. That Facebook vice president David Marcus, the only witness in the Libra hearings, appeals to rank nationalism[11] in his prepared testimony[12], suggesting that if Facebook isn't allowed to establish a parallel currency that could contract credit and torpedo the global economy[13] then China will, doesn't bode well for his confidence in persuading lawmakers. Claiming that Libra's decisions will be made 'democratically' when the decision-makers are a handful of large corporations suggests confusion with democracy itself. He's already backtracked to say that Libra will not launch until it receives 'appropriate approvals,' and that day may never come. Meanwhile, whatever meager credibility Facebook had on managing secure transactions ended when it agreed to a reported $5 billion fine[14] for violating a 2011 consent decree on user privacy with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook stock actually increased when this fine was announced in a Friday news dump; the market clearly signaled that the Federal Trade Commission failed to hold Facebook accountable. That regulatory abandonment\u2014punctuated by a fine instead of structural reforms\u2014in many ways why the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust has embarked on an investigation of digital platforms like Facebook. Today, the subcommittee will hear[15] from representatives of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook, along with a separate panel of mostly critics, including Curse of Bigness author Tim Wu[16], Yale law professor Fiona Scott Morton[17], and Institute for Local Self-Reliance co-director Stacy Mitchell, a frequent Amazon critic. The hearing's focus is innovation and entrepreneurship, and in her prepared testimony, Mitchell savages Amazon as a dominant colossus seeking to extort from rivals and involve itself in everyone's transactions. If the platforms themselves don't fare well in the hearing, the second panel will deliver a punishing blow. As Open Markets Institute director of enforcement Sally Hubbard notes[18], the subcommittee investigation itself, more than public hearings, will drive recommendations for reshaping tech platform markets. With fewer friends in Washington, tech firms will have to rely on high-powered lobbying[19] to protect its dominance. And the platforms have employed less orthodox methods to reach those skeptical lawmakers. A new report[20] out today from the Google Transparency Project details a non-profit named the Connected Commerce Council[21], or 3C, pitching itself as 'the voice of small business.' Curiously, they only seem interested with Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Since launching in 2018, 3C has testified[22] before Congress twice[23], filed public comments[24] in seven separate matters before regulatory agencies, held several events[25], unloaded reams of Big Tech-friendly writing[26] at its website and in newspaper op-eds[27], and met with over 50 members of Congress[28], always defending Big Tech. 'Google is essential to my business,' said the purported publisher[29] of Madeworthy Magainze after a hearing on Google's effect on journalism. 'Members of Congress should know the value Google unlocks for publishers like me.' Here comes the obvious punch line: 3C is an astroturf group for Big Tech. While the small businesses look to be genuine, many happen to have extensive revenue deals with tech firms; one was an event planner at Google's Washington office[30]. Others have been featured speakers[31] at events[32] funded by the platforms. Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Square make up 3C's 'Partner Council[33],' which 3C admits provide 'general support' (i.e. money) for its operations. At least six of 3C's staff and consultants worked for Google, Amazon, or trade groups they financed. Communications groups who get Google and Amazon work are crawling all over 3C's operations. The president of 3C, Jake Ward, spent six years at the Application Developers Alliance[34], another front group of small businesses that had the involvement of Google, and runs another[35] Google and Facebook-funded front group simultaneously. Even an allegedly independent report 3C sent to Congress[36] supporting 'access to digital tools for small businesses' was actually commissioned by Google. The obvious self-dealing from the likes of the platforms might explain the bipartisan revulsion[37] at its tactics. Whether this has reached a tipping point will be on display at the hearings. Does Big Tech have any defenders left in Washington that aren't on the payroll?

He has just published a book called, \"Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America\" in which he denounces Facebook's practices and its impact on society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Wylie laments the sheer level of power Facebook has attained over people's lives. He characterizes it as an unfair battle in which Facebook's users are inevitably the unwilling (though also quite often willing) victims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given Facebook's presence and power over people's lives, society as a whole finds itself in a position of weakness. \"You are more vulnerable, because there's an imbalance in power, because one entity, or one person, knows a lot more about you than vice versa,\" he says.</p><p>Here is today's 3D definition:</p><p>Imbalance:</p><p>The ideal and most eagerly sought situation for anyone with a taste and a reason for wielding power, the most common reason being to extract money from people who have no choice and no ability to counter their power</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contextual Note</emphasis></h><p>Wylie is a true whistleblower intent on pursuing his mission to help people understand what he sees as the threat Facebook represents to the fabric of civilized society. That may sound extreme, but if the idea of democracy is to retain any credibility, Wylie's thesis merits serious discussion. Watching the video of the complete Yahoo interview can be instructive.</p><p>Wylie begins by mentioning Mark Zuckerberg's \"habit of avoiding scrutiny.\" Citing the Facebook founder's defiance of the legal authorities in the UK and Canada, he opines that Zuckerberg may feel \"more comfortable at Congress because he can lobby it more effectively.\" As everyone in the business world knows, corporate money talks in Washington, often tending to drown out other voices.</p><p>After considering the hubris behind Facebook's planned launch of a universal cryptocurrency, Wylie sums up his criticism in these words: \"I question the wisdom of allowing a company to concentrate so many aspects of our society into one product.\" While some people defend Facebook's right, as a profit-making enterprise to innovate in its own interest, Wylie sees its strategy as an effective attack on the cultural integrity and sovereignty of society itself.</p><p>The author focuses on the true political implications of the issue, not just the electoral ones. Influencing elections is bad enough but, according to Wylie, Facebook has been undermining public discourse. He complains that Facebook is \"relegating our democracies around the world and relegating our media and our public discourse to a private company, which is not accountable to people.\" In other words, in its adherence to capitalist orthodoxy, Facebook has achieved a position of virtual cultural monopoly, with the sole aim of making a profit.</p><p>His interviewers in the Yahoo team, intent on defending the principles of capitalism, remained unconvinced. They expressed a point of view that can be summed up in the idea that if it's only about profit, then it shouldn't be considered about abuse.</p><p>One of the interviewers asked Wylie whether he shouldn't take into account the fact that there's \"a benefit to this as well,\" on the grounds that Facebook's capture of data allows it to deliver more personally appropriate information and advertising. \"It's all about transparency, it's all about disclosure,\" he replied. \"It's all about us understanding how this game works in the playing field.\"</p><p>In his view, if Facebook informs people about how they are being manipulated, no harm will be done. Attempting to show that he wasn't about to let Zuckerberg off the hook, he identified Facebook's crime as simply not being transparent enough. To cap his argument, Wylie offered the classic cliche: \"It's all a question of a level playing field, isn't it?\"</p><p>Wylie countered with a telling analogy about an architect who designs a building without fire exits but posts a notice at the entrance \"transparently\" explaining in technical detail the lack of that essential safety feature. The main interviewer then resorted to the \"opt-out\" argument, claiming that there isn't a problem if the consumer can make another choice and go somewhere else. Wylie said that the choices are limited and perhaps nonexistent. A person's online identity has now become an essential feature of their social and professional life. Opting out is tantamount to running away to live in the wilderness. It's possible but self-destructive. \"To exist in modern society,\" he tells us, \"you don't really have a choice but to use these platforms.\"</p><p>He then repeats his essential point: \"The internet is part and parcel of democracy now, whether you like it or not  Do we need rules that we as a society agree on, with independent regulators who are on our side, not on shareholders' side?\"</p><p>Historical Note</p><p>Christopher Wylie's attack focuses on Facebook, but much of what he says concerns the entire historical evolution of social media and the internet and, to some extent, capitalism itself since the 18th century. Much of what he says converges with the description of current trends offered by Shoshana Zuboff, author of the recently published book, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\" Zuboff defines the phenomenon that Wylie calls \"imbalance\" as \"institutionalized asymmetries of knowledge unlike anything ever seen in human history.\"</p><p>Critics like Wylie and Zuboff present what may be called a traditional, pre-capitalist or humanist view of society that has now been overtaken by late-stage capitalist ideology. It has elevated aggressive profit-making and monopolistic thinking to the rank of essential public virtues, to be admired and emulated. The two authors appear to heretically believe that society can benefit from balance and symmetry, or what in Chinese and other Asian cultures people call \"harmony,\" the highest of their core values. What Wylie and Zuboff demonstrate is that the working principle for successful companies today - a principle that most people tacitly approve of and the ambient culture has accepted - is imbalance, asymmetry and extreme dissonance.</p><p>We can situate the origin of the current respect for dissonance, disruptive emotions and polarized thought in the triumph of an increasing radicalized economic ideology that has, over time, consistently and progressively rewarded the accumulation of power. Capitalist apologists cite the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith as the founder of their ideology. Smith described the workings of national economies in his time, at the very beginning of the industrial revolution, when outside of trading companies - such as the East India Company - economic and political power was rarely concentrated. </p><p>Over the next two centuries, the growing respect for concentrated power undermined and imperceptibly perverted Smith's original premise. Smith's vision reflected his adherence to the idea of a well-regulated society that, because of its internal harmony, could benefit from the famous \"invisible hand,\" a natural effect of local competition that permitted continual adjustment and optimization of the roles of rational economic actors. He could not imagine the degree of concentration of power that would be enabled by future industrial development. He equally could never have imagined that modern ideologues would use his theory to justify the obsessive concentration of power we see today in both politics and business, elevating the principle disharmony to the level of a coveted ideal.</p><p>Today's big tech companies cultivate the science of creating and defending monopolies. It has become easier than in the past because superficially they do not appear to be as absolute or easily identifiable as the monopolies and trusts that early 20th-century reformers attacked and often successfully dismantled. Tech companies have to work hard to achieve their monopolistic status. Defense suppliers and banks have an easier time occupying their monopolistic niches because they depend on governments and governments depend on them. The 18th-century virtues of fair and efficient competition were basically phased out over the next two centuries.</p><p>The Yahoo interview demonstrates how thoroughly the media, and particularly its specialists of finance, have bought into the outdated capitalist ideology and use it to avoid thinking about modern problems. They believe there is \"choice\" when there is none. They cling to the idea of homo economicus, man as a rational decision-maker who will make the decisions that guarantee a \"level playing field.\" They voluntarily ignore the cynicism of monopolist leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, even when he spells it out in his leaked audio.</p><p>As a final illustration of how good theories (Smith's) can be turned into their opposite and benevolent intentions turned into malevolent ones, in his book, Wylie describes what happened when Steve Bannon became associated with Cambridge Analytica, at a time when Wylie felt inebriated after having discovered the wonderful powers of data collection that he imagined could be mobilized to solve identified social problems, including detecting and defeating terrorism:\"When Steve Bannon got introduced to the company, he realized that a lot of that work could be inverted. And rather than trying to mitigate an extremist insurgency in certain parts of the world, he wanted to essentially catalyze one in the United States.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FROBSR-0049958845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FROBSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X95-44G1-DXMP-K309-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1580\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fair Observer, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fair Observer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump himself hasn't yet commented (that could change any moment), but Reuters reports[3] that he's given ByteDance 45 days to strike a formal agreement. Before continuing: Yes, it is abnormal for a U.S. president to dictate the timeline (and maybe terms) of a U.S. company-led acquisition. </p><p>It also remains unclear what mechanism Trump planned to use to block TikTok. This is not playing very well on Chinese social media, where ByteDance's CEO has been accused of betraying his country.'It's less about this particular app and more about what this app can be used to leverage in the future,' meaning new apps and possibly the collection of more sensitive data, a source familiar with the CFIUS process tells Axios' Ashley Gold. What comes next? Negotiation, and lots of it. Microsoft and ByteDance have not yet agreed on a price, per a source familiar with the situation.Microsoft said in its statement that its plans would be to own and operate TikTok in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Either that list will expand, or Microsoft and ByteDance will need to work out content sharing between the Microsoft-owned version of TikTok and whoever ends up owning the rest (particularly places like the U.K. and Japan). And obviously this would impact price.Microsoft will still need to prove to U.S. regulators (and to ByteDance) that it can basically reengineer the TikTok code, since the White House effectively wants new software in addition to a new mailing address.Microsoft also said it may invite other U.S. investors into the deal 'on a minority basis.' Unclear if this would involve letting existing ByteDance backers like General Atlantic roll over their shares, but it does seem to indicate that Microsoft may plan to operate TikTok as an independent entity that can eventually go public on its own. A wildcard: Amazon. I've got no intel that Amazon wants to buy TikTok, but I'd be surprised if it's not at least kicking the tires. It's the only other U.S. company with the cash, tech capacity, and lack of obvious antitrust issues that could get it done.Plus it has an obvious interest in social content, as evidenced by its Twitch purchase, and its involvement could help at least bid up the price for Microsoft. The bottom line: Microsoft's market cap is up around $60 billion in early trading, which means it might have already 'paid off' this deal.Go deeper: <url

Ours is without a question a nation divided, but ours is also a prosperous nation, and all Americans from all walks of life are benefiting from this Trump economy that shared rising prosperity is also raising President Trump's popularity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The number of people who approve of the president's handling of the economy is rising. And so are those who clearly oppose the open border policies of the radical left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We'll take up this new prosperous America and its effect on our political economy and the presidential fortunes and fate of 24 Democrats and this incumbent president.</p><p>Also tonight, the Dems moving deeper in disarray on this the eve of Robert Mueller's return to Capitol Hill. Jerry Nadler, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee now claims Mueller doesn't have to abide by the rules set by the Department of Justice and his committee doesn't have to abide by the rules and guidelines of the house.</p><p>And Mueller himself is the one who asked for those rules from the Department of Justice. The Radical Dems letting it be known today Mueller's top aide on Russia witch-hunt will be allowed to sit beside the former special council as he testifies tomorrow.</p><p>And this breaking tonight, the Justice Department announcing its antitrust division is now investigating how big tech companies, search companies, online retailers, social media are doing business specifically, whether they are breaking antitrust laws, whether they are restricting competition, and ultimately harming consumers and users.</p><p>The Department of Justice announcement rock the tech sector and after-hours trading, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook stocks all selling off, most down are full percentage price. Edward Lawrence in Washington tonight with this breaking story, Ed?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Lou. The Justice Department announces will be a broad review of whether the dominant tech firms engage it basically monopolistic behavior.</p><p>Now, we're talking about firms like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google, and the Justice Department wants to know if they engage in behavior that stifles competition, that reduces competition, stifles innovation, and harms consumers.</p><p>The review will look at what the president has been talking about for a long time that one voice gets amplified in social media in online searches and other one silence and big tech firms decide which is which.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. You have to have free speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And in announcement, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust says that quote, \"Without the discipline of meaningful market based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>Now the goal of the review is to assess whether the competitive conditions in online marketplace exist. They want to make sure that Americans have access to free market.</p><p>Now, if there are violations in this, the Justice Department says that they will act appropriately, that could be, Lou, that they could break up the big tech giants if the violations they find, if they find any are big enough. Back to you.</p><p>DOBBS: And big enough is the question isn't it? Silicon Valley, whether it's Facebook, whether it is Twitter, whether it is Google, and the list unfortunately goes on in a variety of lanes in technology in this country.</p><p>The question is, whether or not they will have any competition because right now at least the top companies whether they be Amazon, Facebook, whether it be Google flat out, they don't have competition?</p><p>LAWRENCE: Right. And part of this Lou will be the practice of those companies gobbling up their competition. You know the smaller firms, that people who innovate, who created good idea. Instagram is a good example of that.</p><p>Facebook couldn't beat Instagram so they bought Instagram and that's kind of what the big tech giants have been doing and the Justice Department will review this kind of mergers or acquisitions.</p><p>DOBBS: And I don't recall there being an intensive review of that acquisition of Instagram by Facebook. That is one place where we probably will see a substantial difference in the way this Department of Justice along with many other areas where we hope there will be big changes as well.</p><p>Edward Lawrence, as always thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Lawrence, reporting from Washington. Five months after President Trump declared a national emergency at our southern border. DHS Acting Secretary, Kevin McAleenan today decided he will follow orders, at last.</p><p>DHS expanding a 1996 program allowing customs and border protection to quickly deport illegal immigrants who do not have an asylum claim or immigration court date pending.</p><p>McAleenan saying this, quote, \"We are pass the breaking point and must take all appropriate action to enforce the law along the U.S. borders and within the country's interior.\" Now, mind you this is five months since the President declared a national emergency.</p><p>\"This designation makes it clear that if you have no legal right to be here, we will remove you.\" The principle question is of course five months after the president declared that national emergency, why is he's acting DHS Secretary only now prepared to fully enforce immigration laws?</p><p>Our first guest tonight says the expansion of expedited removal will cut even further into the numbers of illegal border crossers that's part of the plan.</p><p>Joining us tonight president of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd. Brandon, good to have you with us. Your thoughts on this announcement that the immigration laws are going to be enforced?</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: This is another piece of the puzzle that we were looking for to get put into the broader picture. If we enforce the immigration laws such as expedited removal, we expand that out, we're allowed to remove people immediately upon crossing the border illegally rather than releasing them, the catch and release program and waiting two to five years.</p><p>When we remove that magnet, when we get rid of that incentive, it drops illegal immigration. I take you right back to 2017, the reason why we dropped to 45 year laws is because people thought that they were going to be removed immediately.</p><p>Unfortunately, DHS didn't have the political will to implement the proper policies and that's why we saw an increase. Now, you see the administration taking this head on saying, we're not going to accept excuses anymore from DHS. We're going to force them to do the right thing and now they are and that's going to drop numbers.</p><p>DOBBS: This seems to be a without question, an inflection point in the administration. McAleenan, it seems to me at least, this is purely my opinion, seems to for the first time be talking about driving the enforcement of immigration laws and meaning business whether it be interior enforcement, whether it be at the border?</p><p>JUDD: We go back to 2018, and DHS didn't even ask the 9th circuit Court of Appeals to revise its review of whether or not we can hold children for longer than 20 days.</p><p>I mean it took well into 2018 to do it. So now you're seeing the administration stepping up and saying there's no more excuses, we're not going to accept excuses from our agencies, from our agencies heads.</p><p>You will step up and you will do the job. And that's exactly what's happening here. The agency heads are now stepping up and they're doing their job and frankly it's simply because President Trump put the right people in.</p><p>When he puts Mark Morgan as the head of CVP, when he puts Cucinelli the head of CIS, these then forces McAleenan to do the right things and we're expecting to see good things out of it.</p><p>DOBBS: And where is our friend Tom Homan?</p><p>JUDD: I don't know where --</p><p>DONNS: Immigrations are to be?</p><p>JUDD: I think so, I mean that's again, I certainly hope that is what's going to happen. I know that Tom should --</p><p>DOBBS: I hope so for the nation's sake.</p><p>JUDD: Yeah, absolutely. The talks are ongoing, and I think that's going to happen. You know Lou, you're leading into your program was talking about free speech and you played a clip for President Trump saying that free speech has to happen.</p><p>If we had an honest discussion in this country with the mainstream media and we talked about what's really happening with illegal immigration, this is absolutely winning issue.</p><p>The vast majority the American public does not want to have open borders. The problem is the vast majority of American public just doesn't know what's truly happening because the mainstream media isn't tracking about it.</p><p>When we talk about illegal immigration and we talk about what's really happening on the border, the American public wants it done.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's talk about what's really happening. What's really happening is we have already had more border crossing apprehensions this year as of right now then all of last year.</p><p>So the rhetoric continues, new programs, new operations, we heard a lot of discussion about interior enforcement. And I will take this administration at its word that this time it means to have interior en enforcement.</p><p>But we haven't seen it yet and it goes on and on. This is repeating a pattern of the past. Now a year, it is absolutely -- it's absolutely unacceptable to the American people, to the president's base. It's deleterious to his political fortunes.</p><p>In my opinion, I know that there are very wise and clever people serving this president who have much better informed opinions, but I'll tell you this, they're going to be just as wrong as the pollsters were in 2016 if they pursue this nonsense.</p><p>JUDD: No, and they will. And that's again why I'm so excited about the expansion of the expedited removal program. Again when you look at the entire landscape, we have a bunch of puzzle pieces that are separated.</p><p>We have to make those pieces and we have to put them together. Expedited removal is one of those major pieces and when we remove people from the country, numbers will drop. President Trump understands that, he knows that.</p><p>He's been pushing for it. Unfortunately, he's been getting push back from those agency heads that frankly don't want to implement his policies and his agenda.</p><p>DOBBS: Who the hell do they think they work for those agent heads?</p><p>JUDD: And that's the problem, that's the swamp. Lou, that is exactly the swamp. These are the people that think this is a machine. In D.C. it is a well-oiled machine and to break that machine up is very, very difficult.</p><p>We're fighting against that machine day in and day out. But if we continue to fight and we don't give up, we can get to where we want be.</p><p>DOBBS: And I'm still very confident that we will do just that because of this president, and because of men like you and women throughout the border patrol, through DHS, and the entire government work to do and promises to keep. Brandon Judd, as always great to have you with us. Thanks.</p><p>JUDD: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news tonight, Fox Business confirming now that the United States and China are about to face-to-face trade talks in China this coming Monday.</p><p>A senior administration official telling us that U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin will be meeting with the Chinese Vice-Premier and the be Commerce Minister in Shanghai.</p><p>There is no reason given for changing venue from Beijing, the capital of course of China and switching to Shanghai but we will share that with you as soon as we learn the reason, the purpose for doing so.</p><p>This is the 12th round of talks amid further signs of a weakening Chinese economy reports that more than 50 companies have now moved or are considering moves their supply chains out of China all together because of U.S. tariffs.</p><p>Well, up next Attorney General Bill Barr, cutting through the radical left lies about Robert Mueller's upcoming testimony. We will take it up with Congressman Jim Jordan here next also.</p><p>Sleepy Joe Biden, the president calls him contradicting one of his own biggest selling points. That contradiction may amount to a lie. Is that what it is? We'll find out. We take that up and much more right after the break, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Well another blunder from Joe Biden, the 2020 hopeful says he can beat President Trump next year but he doesn't know whether he would have fared very well in the past.</p><p>When asked from the New York Times Magazine if he could have beaten Trump in 2016 Biden said this, \"I don't know.\" Since then President Trump is a master record of success setting himself apart from Biden, the rest of the Radical Dem hopefuls for 2020.</p><p>And oh yes, his achievements outnumbering those of any modern president that preceded him. A majority of Americans demonstrating support for President Trump's America first economy and opposition to the open border policies of the Radical Dems.</p><p>The NPR, Marist poll finds 53 percent of American adults approve with the president's handling of the economy when it comes to question of decriminalizing illegal border crosser 66 percent of Americans oppose that idea.</p><p>And 62 percent oppose national health insurance for illegal immigrants. Joining us tonight Former Reagan White House Political Director, leading Republican Strategist, Fox Business Political Analyst the savant himself, Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, GREAT AMERICA PAC CHAIRMAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed, good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Poll after poll, we've got a lot to talk about here tonight. And I don't see in any of it good news, but we're going to get your view here in just a moment. I want to ask you first, Joe Biden saying he didn't -- he doesn't know whether he could have beaten Trump in 2016. Is that just a Biden blunder?</p><p>ROLLINS: I can answer this question, he couldn't. He couldn't beat Hilary last time and the one place that he decided he was going to go plant the flag. He's going to Scranton which is where he came from in Pennsylvania and Trump won his home county as he won the state.</p><p>So my sense is we're starting to see Biden at his finest which is he's not a good campaigner, never has been and he's starting to stumble all over the place. So I don't believe he's going to be the nominee. I've said that over and over again. If he is, I think crumples pressure.</p><p>DOBBS: Well to be seen and with that forecast from the savant, I wouldn't give Biden much of the chance. Let's turn to this latest NPR Marist Poll and let's take a look at the president's approval rating on the economy.</p><p>This is it looks to me very hard for this president to get beaten by one of these 20 some odd Democrats?</p><p>ROLLINS: Now, what he has to do is he has to stress. You know, the polls were all going to be in 44, 45 percent at this point in time which is where he's been throughout his presidency and that means that 90 percent of Republicans support him, 90 percent of Democrats --</p><p>DOBBS: Let's put up that -- excuse me, let's put up that Marist Poll pm the economy and the president's approval rating if we would please? There it is.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, he get into the substance which is the economy which has been the great strength that this president and obviously it's been his policies that have pushed this economy forward. Then people say my life is much better, I'm doing well, and that should be total strength of this campaign.</p><p>So you know, the bottom line is when you've divided like we are as a country, it comes down to those independent voters and Trump is a little behind there today a couple of points.</p><p>But once those people focus, that last ones you need to focus on how well their life is today as oppose to what it was four years ago. I think the president is going to be just fine.</p><p>DOBBS: And let's take a look at the president's tweet on his handling of that economy. He said this, the newest poll -- if we could put up that tweet please?</p><p>The newest poll, 11 percent in favor of starting ridiculous impeachment hearings. Think about that, 11 percent. We'll let's see, we have the best economy in history, the best employment numbers in history by the way, each of this is a factual statement.</p><p>Most people working in history, highest stock market in history, biggest tax and regulation cuts in history. And there you are, that's what each one of these dreamers has to contend with.</p><p>ROLLINS: And Chairman Nadler has wanted this since the day he became chairman. He has put a staff together. He is the only one who's pushing this hard. There's about 70, 80 Democrats that have signed on, I don't think it's as high as 90 out of majority.</p><p>And so I don't think it's going anywhere and I think tomorrow could finish it all because Mueller is going to basically do what's in the report. If you read the report, there's nothing in that report.</p><p>DOBBS: And also the opposition to open borders policy within the same poll. Let's put up, decriminalizing illegal immigration. This is a fascinating number. If we could put that up please on the full screen, pretty please?</p><p>We'll be very patient. I promise you we'll be brief, I apologize. There it is.</p><p>ROLLINS: There it is.</p><p>DOBBS: 66 percent of moderate say it's a bad idea. Think about that, a moderate say it's a bad idea.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: Providing health cares to illegals, 62 percent oppose it. If we could put that up as well. The Dems, I have already, I mean, they're just putting themselves in a corner from which they have no escape right now.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, worse than that, they've got 20 candidates who want to talk about issues, and all the issues that they've talked about are either outdated or cost an enormous sum of money as they get explored.</p><p>So my sense is they have nothing to run against Trump on to be better sort of being a total anti-Trump ticket. But at the end, they're not going to win that either but they're not going to beat him on policy, they're not going to beat on economic policy either.</p><p>DOBBS: Mueller tomorrow and I want to remind our audience that the Fox Business will be without question carrying that hearing throughout.</p><p>But this thing about having his chief of staff sitting next to him, changing the rules here in the last day which maybe a violation as Congressman Doug Collins says of the house's rules itself. I have to say, Mueller looks weak and certainly uncertain.</p><p>ROLLINS: His heart is in this, he didn't want to testify made it very clear from the start. He wrote his report, he pass on the bar. He has fought daily his among way up there. He certainly doesn't want to be up there in man of hours he has to do.</p><p>And my sense is he doesn't know everything that's in that report. I think he's read it I'm sure and he signed off on it. But at the end of the day, the details on how it all came about then what it is he wasn't involved at all that.</p><p>So my sense is he's not going to be a new witness in the sence that what's in that report is --</p><p>DOBBS: Is he going to say anything new?</p><p>ROLLINS: No, absolutely not. My sense is he testified 88 times in the past, he's always by the book kind of guy. And my sense is that will be the script and he'll dock and dodge all day long when the Democrats try and push him one way or the other.</p><p>The key thing I hope is the Republicans push hard and basically just keep it on the straight and narrow.</p><p>DOBBS: And they certainly have some questions for Mr. Mueller?</p><p>ROLLINS: They should have.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Rollins, thanks for answering my questions.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Appreciate it, as always. President Trump today reacting to news that Boris Johnson has been named the new prime minister of Great Britain.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He's tough and he's smart. They're saying Britain Trump. They call him Britain Trump and people saying, that's a good thing that they like me over there. That's what they wanted.</p><p>That's what they need. That's what they need, he'll get it done. Boris is good. He's going to do a good job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The president, an enthusiastic Boris Johnson supporter. Johnson replaces Theresa May and he takes office tomorrow. The new head of the conservative party promising a do-or-die Brexit deadline of October 31, meaning very simply he will get them out of the E.U. come hell or high water.</p><p>Up next, the radical left allows Robert Mueller to make last minute changes to tomorrow's appearance before the house judiciary committee. Congressman Jim Jordan joins us right after this break. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: The drug cartels operating near the Mexico's northern border, our southern border, are aggressively recruiting young teenagers to their organization.</p><p>Authorities in Mexico telling Breitbart they've noticed a spike in juveniles, some as young as 12 years old now carrying guns, drugs, and lots of money.</p><p>They put that -- they put it out that many of those kids just stay in a minimum-security juvenile center for a few days when they are arrested, then they're back on the streets and back working for the cartels.</p><p>A new poll tonight finds immigration is the most important issue in this country. A record 27 percent of Americans now telling Gallup that they see the challenge of illegal immigration as the country's toughest, toughest challenge that's up from the previous record of 23 percent set just last month.</p><p>Joining us tonight, a congressman with new legislation to deal with the border crisis, Republican Lance Gooden of Texas joining us tonight.</p><p>REP. LANCE GOODEN (R-TX): Thanks.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with the legislation that you've introduced and how important do you think it will be in this fight against the cartels, open borders and illegal immigration?</p><p>Sure, the reason for this legislation is we have a problem right now with traffickers bringing children over. Because by having a child, you can claim that you're a family unit and you get preferential treatment, you can only be detained for up to 20 days. And so, child traffickers are snatching up these children south of the border and using them and then sending them back across the border after they have shuttled a group across and recycling these children.</p><p>What this bill does is it requires a DNA test to be performed. It's just a mouth swab at the border that determines if there really is a familial relationship. If you can't pass a DNA test, then you've got to provide documentation that says that these children are supposed to be in your care custody and control. And if you can't provide that, then you're child trafficker and we don't want you. And we're going to lock you up and then we're going to take care of those children. We're hoping to discourage trafficking across our southern border.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. And the number somewhere around a third of all children travelling with adults turned out not to be related to those -- to those other adult illegal immigrants. This goes back to the Obama administration when DNA testing, the foundation for it had been put into action. And for whatever reason, the administration decided not to pursue it. Your thoughts on both their reasons and why it's taken so long to bring this to the forefront.</p><p>GOODEN: You know, I'll go -- I'll go back to that third number you cited, that's just what we know about. We don't even know about what we're not catching at the border. And so, what this aims to accomplish is discouraging child trafficking. I don't know why the Obama administration got away from stopping this before. It festered into the problem that we have today. But I know that Republicans and I believe Democrats also stand with me against child trafficking. Surely this concept would be bipartisan. Surely Democrats would come to the table and say this is a solution to end child trafficking, this is not an immigration hot-button debate issue as much as it is a humanitarian issue that everyone should rally behind.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, border security as you know, illegal immigration, they are humanitarian issues. They are humanitarian issues 70,000 deaths in this country from overdoses. Most of those as a result of opioids that have crossed that border from Mexico. This primary source of methamphetamines, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, Mexico. All of that money flowing by the tens of billions to the drug cartels of Mexico, some 20 of them.</p><p>GOODEN: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: Seven major cartels. This is a war with those cartels and the money they're making off illegal immigration, it's unconscionable.</p><p>GOODEN: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: And the radical Dems, the Schumer's and the Pelosi's have refused to step up and close loopholes and to help this president enforce the security of that border and end illegal immigration.</p><p>GOODEN: It's a shame that it's come to this point. If there's any good that comes out of any of this, it's that Donald Trump's going to be reelected. But until then, why make these children suffer? Why do we even have to deal with this? Why have Democrats allowed it to get to be as bad as it is?</p><p>And I believe this bill will address that. I look forward to a debate in Congress and I really do challenge my Democrats to come across the aisle, put aside their partisan politics, put aside their leftist agenda. And say, you know what, if we're serious about child trafficking, let's come together and actually solve it.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, congressman, you're giving the radical Dems led in your -- in your body by Nancy Pelosi the speaker an opportunity to act in the national interest instead of continue their ways as the party of hate. It is -- it's time for them to turn and to change.</p><p>GOODEN: I agree.</p><p>DOBBS: And thank you for giving them in the country the opportunity.</p><p>GOODEN: Thank you for your show, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman Lance Gooden, thank you, appreciate it.</p><p>Up next, there could be a special guest at Robert Mueller's testimony tomorrow. We'll tell you all about that, much more, straight ahead right after this quick break, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler misinformed as to the facts concerning Robert Mueller's upcoming testimony before his committee. Nadler blasted the Justice Department for its letter instructing Mueller to limit his testimony to the boundaries of the public special counsel report. Attorney General William Barr today said, it's Mueller who asked for those guidelines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, as you know, at his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that. And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position. And they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them what our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance they had requested.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And Robert Mueller it turns out, will have someone joining him at the witness table during tomorrow's Judiciary Committee hearing, it will be Aaron Zebley. A longtime aide and counsel to Mueller who served on Mueller's special counsel team.</p><p>President Trump has by the way just now reacted to all of this on Twitter, saying this, quote, just got back only to hear of a last-minute change allowing a never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. Very unfair, should not be allowed. A rigged witch-hunt. The president's words tweeted out just moments ago.</p><p>Our next guest here tonight says you shouldn't get to change rules right before the beginning of a -- of a hearing, especially after a 22 month $30 million investigation. Joining us tonight is Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, member of the House Judiciary Committee, House Oversight Committee and the Freedom Caucus. Congressman, great to have you with us.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You too, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you agree with the president? Zebley showing --</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, he's a -- he's a hundred percent right. You don't get to change the rules 10 minutes before kickoff, that's what they're doing. Even Secretary Clinton when she testified for hours and hours in front of the Benghazi Committee, Cheryl Mills wasn't sitting beside her.</p><p>This just shows the lengths that Jerry Nadler will go to get after this president. It's -- I mean, it's all about trying to -- trying to stop the -- stop President Trump, this is ridiculous. Zebley was his chief of staff, Zebley was a partner of his at WilmerHale. Zebley even represented the person who set up Hillary Clinton's server. I mean, so and yet he's going to be right there front and center. And the president's exactly right, I have never seen this in my 12-1/2 years in Congress.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, one thing is very, very positive in this, is there should be no doubt in anyone's mind what Mueller is, what Zebley is and the fact that as the president has said from the outset, this has been a witch-hunt, a partisan witch hunt from the very beginning. And he has much to answer for -- are you going to be able tomorrow to ask Zebley and his client Robert Mueller the important questions?</p><p>JORDAN: Oh, yes, we are. And my question is going to be directed direct to Robert Mueller. They're not going to be to Aaron Zebley. In fact, I want Robert Mueller to answer that questions --</p><p>DOBBS: I said it that way for your (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, his name is the -- (INAUDIBLE) he was the Special Counsel, he did the 22 month investigation. But this just underscores something in spite of the fact that you had 19 Democrat lawyers out to get the president, they still found nothing, no collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>And remember, it wasn't just the 22 month investigation that Bob Mueller did for 10 months prior to that. They opened this investigation July 31st, 2016.</p><p>DOBBS: The FBI investigation.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, they go 10 months. When we deposed Jim Comey, when we deposed him after he had been fired, he said, up until the point he was fired, they still didn't have anything. So they found nothing after 10 months. Bob Mueller with 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 witnesses, 2,000 subpoenas, $30 million, 22 months, does another 22 month investigation, they find nothing.</p><p>So, 32 months and they find nothing but now, this big hearing, they're going to bring in Zebley to sit beside director Mueller hoping the Democrats, hoping that he'll say something that can be helpful to their crazy impeachment effort.</p><p>DOBBS: I have -- I have to as I rarely do argue with you about one point, they found something. They found someone that needs to be held accountable for breaking laws, for breaking the guidelines of the Department of Justice. And in every instance, it's a -- it is a member of the Department of Justice, are the FBI who should be right now being prosecuted.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: They are not. I'm sure Mueller would like to speak to that. Will he be given the opportunity to --</p><p>JORDAN: Well, --</p><p>DOBBS: -- account for the this nonsense? I mean, it's a complete ruse.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, no, you're right. And I love what the Attorney General said. Attorney General Barr, he said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI, and this is so true.</p><p>Comey fired, Andy McCabe fired, lied three times under oath. FBI chief counsel Jim Baker, demoted then left. FBI counsel Lisa Page, demoted then left. FBI Counterintelligence had Peter Strzok demoted then fired. These were the five key people.</p><p>So there was a real problem there. Not with any type of collusion whatsoever between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the election.</p><p>DOBBS: And is the House -- are you House Republicans going to be able to do anything about the addition of Zebley to the -- to the table before your committee?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, like the president, we've been -- we've been protesting this all day. And again, a last-minute thing that they spring on you, I have never seen it in all my time in Congress.</p><p>Even like I said, even Secretary Clinton when she testified, Cheryl Mills or David Kendall, her lawyers weren't sitting at the table with her. So, this is not how it's done. So I've never seen someone actually sit at the witness table who wasn't in effect sworn in, but that's supposedly the arrangement tomorrow. We'll see when this thing kicks off tomorrow at 8:30.</p><p>DOBBS: At 8:30. What -- can you give us just an inkling as to how -- what you think will transpire. Do you expect revelations? Do you believe that the Zebley is basically there to keep the former special counsel out of trouble or to create more trouble?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I don't know. He may be there just to -- my concern is he only get five minutes. He may be there just to try to eat up time. Maybe if Director Mueller has a question he wants to consult with him, I hope that doesn't count against your time because you only get five minutes to question a pretty important witness.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Nadler strikes me as a very fair person, Congressman.</p><p>JORDAN: Well, we'll see. What I'm focused on is the five minutes of questioning I get to have trying to get the information out that I think is important for the American people to understand so let's see how it goes tomorrow. But you can -- you can rest assured Republicans I think are coming there to ask the important questions and hopefully get information for the taxpayers of this great country.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, we look forward to it. I know you are -- you are loaded for bear. Congressman Jim Jordan, thanks so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>JORDAN: Thank you.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments, follow us on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight. Up next, President Trump taking another shot at the radical quartet of freshman Democratic socialists. Stay with us, we'll have that and much more, we're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight, the Daily Caller's Editorial Director Vince Coglianese. Good to have you with us. And Emily Compagno, former Federal Attorney, Fox Business Contributor. Great to see you. And Emily, let's start with the president going after the House Judiciary Committee allowing Robert Mueller's former chief of staff to sit with him as the hearing goes on. What do you think?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Whatever stunts are pulled, whatever things happen tomorrow, we're not going to learn anything new and that's been obvious this entire time. And the Democrats will try to pull out sound bites that they will then shape into what they deem are smoking guns, but there isn't going to be that and it's not going to work.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you agree with that?</p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, DAILY CALLER: Yes. Either Mueller is a man of his word and sticks to just the report or he says something new and is a liar. Those are his options tomorrow. And if it's the former, then it's going to be a deeply boring hearing. And the whole point of this hearing, I'll remind everyone, is to sort of put Mueller's report as a book on tape.</p><p>Democrats are deeply dissatisfied with the way it impacted. The President's approval ratings have only gone up since the release of the Mueller report. This is a last-ditch effort to try and convince Democrats to turn against the president -- convince Americans to turn against the president by the Democrats in Congress.</p><p>DOBBS: I have to say, I wonder why the speaker is allowing this to go on because she's -- she has to understand she's -- whatever else she is, she's a smart politician. She knows the Democrats are taking hit after hit, after hit. There is no report conclusion of collusion. There can be no substantive obstruction. It's a fool's game that's being played here.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And because the Mueller will from what we know thus far stick to the reductive and published report, right, he will stick to the confines per DOJ and his statements in May, it means that it declines and denies the Democrats this opportunity to have him say anything different.</p><p>So if anything, they're setting themselves up for failure at every level because there's no wiggle room at all for there to be that thing that's not there.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, speaking of not there, not there will be James Comey but Comey manages to give us a sound bite from time to time that leaves us all scratching our head. So here is Comey, a couple of samples if we may.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What sort of exposure does Attorney General Barr have?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: Well, I don't think he'll be attacked by the witness or witnesses. I think he may be attacked by Democrats fairly in my view for misrepresenting what was in Director Mueller's report and how he handled the entire thing and the way he has slimed the FBI since.</p><p>If this were a case about someone who other than the president, they'd already have been indicted on at least several of these obstruction incidents, maybe all of them, I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Vince, your thoughts about Comey and what a sick puppy he appears to be.</p><p>COGLIANESE: James Comey is a man who sounds very nervous about what's going to come next. We're still waiting for an inspector general report that's going to detail some things and Comey's name reportedly may very well come up in that.</p><p>Remember, he was asked by the commander in chief to say three times that he was not under investigation to make that clear to the American public, and he refused to do that. The president eventually firing him and then this became -- he became the epicenter of all of this.</p><p>His scrutiny of Bob Barr -- of Bill Barr rather is kind of nuts because Bill Barr's summary was accurate. He said there was no collusion and he was -- and he rendered the judgment that there was no obstruction. That's exactly what the Mueller report says in many more pages.</p><p>But James Comey is upset about it because I think he's getting ready to be put through the wringer himself.</p><p>DOBBS: It's very clear that James Comey lacks the I.Q. points to be contesting with William Barr and so he looks even more absurd and in so many ways off as he tries to do so. Let's turn to that -- with William Barr Justice Department going after Silicon Valley, investigating their anti-trust behavior.</p><p>I think most people would stipulate that that is indeed the reality. Your thoughts about the announcement today.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Viewers need to understand this has been a long time coming. And in 2013, quite a while ago, remember that the FTC declined to both break up Google as well as change all of their efforts. They've been subjected big tech to more heightened scrutiny in Europe than they have here, right. They've been -- they paid $9 billion in fines over there. Here we've really barely scratched the surface.</p><p>Note to that the DOJ in the past couple years has really levied barely anything statistically against companies in the antitrust realm at all. So I think they were gearing up more and a lot to come.</p><p>DOBBS: And Vince, as we wrap up here, the President has rebranded the quartet or the squad whatever they want to call themselves. It's now AOC plus three.</p><p>COGLIANESE: That's right. Well, it's a -- look, this is a squad that the president is happy to elevate because Nancy Pelosi has a tremendous problem on her hands and so do the Democratic presidential candidates.</p><p>So long as these four Democrats represent the face of that party, Americans are not eager in any way to embrace the socialism, the destruction of the American economy, and the contempt for average Americans that they all exude. So this is a losing gambit for the Democratic Party so long as they represents them.</p><p>DOBBS: Vince, thanks so much. Emily, thank you. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler allowing Robert Mueller's Counsel and former Chief of Staff Aaron Zebley to appear at tomorrow's hearing with Mueller. President Trump today blasted the endless witch hunt conducted by these Radical DIMMs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No collusion, no obstruction, oh, that's not good enough. Let's go more. $40 million, interview 500 people, they got nothing. And yet it goes on. And they think this is helping them. I personally think it's hurting them. A lot of people think it's very bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: It's very bad because the -- it's the prosecutors and the FBI that have been found to have broken the law. That's it for us tonight. Attorney Sidney Powell, Victoria Toensing, Joe diGenova, and Congressman Louie Gohmert among our guests here tomorrow. Please join us for all of that. See you then. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2019072301cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-J761-JB20-G1NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They seemed to be trusted with the future of the company, responsible for creating tools to help us publish our stories and decode the data that came back to us about our readers. In meeting after meeting, low-ranking executives, accompanied by these code jockeys, would instruct editors on how to game SEO and social media algorithms, reminding us about the need to remain vigilant in the face of an ever-changing media landscape. No one really seemed to know how to fix the ailing media company, but that didn't prevent anyone from religiously paying tithes to the very technologies undermining our shared industry.1</p><p/><p>When I wasn't at work stressing out over the ticker counters that gave value to my toil, I was still trapped in this world. I looked at my feeds when I woke up, trawling through the news, memes, and life events; I swiped between photos of strangers on dating apps; and I signed away the rights to my privacy and image with each new app I downloaded. Sometimes I would accept invitations to parties from friends on the very social media apps that were ruining my industry, and I would find myself in penthouses owned by early employees of what were known in the tech world as \"unicorns\"-start-ups with a valuation of $1 billion or more. Feeling flattered and, at the same time, guilty to be invited, I would spend a lot of time gawking at the excess: free drugs, alcohol, and hired help. I would think that no one, especially no twentysomethings, should be this rich. I still partook in the luxuries on offer. Surrounded by my college-educated peers who had done the smart thing and sold out, I wondered if being an editor and writer was worth the trouble. I knew I wasn't alone in this, because a lot of my friends who came of economic age after 2008 were asking the same thing. Precarious, overeducated, and complicit in a rigged economic system we knew was undermining our own work, we wondered why we hadn't all sent in job applications to the next hot tech company. (I did, to be honest, and was rejected.)2</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis>, a remarkable memoir of her nearly five years working in San Francisco's start-up scene, Anna Wiener tells us what happens when you do end up in the tech world-and about the anguish it has caused. A liberal-arts-educated East Coaster and erstwhile denizen of New York's literary scene, Wiener provides an achingly relatable and sharply focused firsthand account of how a set of \"ambitious, aggressive, arrogant young men from America's soft suburbs,\" backed by vast capital investments and armed with data analytics technology, helped to refashion not just our economy but also our culture, aesthetics, and politics with the new digital tools they produced.3</p><p>At the center of Wiener's narrative is a story about a generation: For her, the great innovation of the young people behind the continuing second dot-com bubble has been to persuade the rest of the world to fetishize the prophetic power of data and to get us to trade away privacy for optimization. But as an employee guiltily benefiting from this gold rush, she gives us a cautionary tale about the dangerous work cultures these tech companies cultivated as well. While warning about the collection of data and the way it reaffirms some of the most invidious forms of inequality in our society, she examines how tech companies were run on a toxic cocktail of misogyny, prejudice, and rampant surveillance. Unlike several other recent nonfiction dispatches from Silicon Valley, her book is less interested in making sense of the tech boom through the eyes and foibles of start-up founders and more concerned with asking questions from the point of view of the young people they employed. Although her memoir charts her eventual escape from this world, it also reminds us that even if we don't work in tech and refuse to engage with the world that start-ups have created, we still need something far greater than rejection to resolve these issues. In this way, Wiener's book, while not explicitly political, gives us a road map to the ways we can turn our growing dissatisfaction with what tech has wrought into the backbone of an ideology.4</p><p>efore 2013, when she plunged headfirst into the start-up scene, Wiener was an assistant at a middling Manhattan-based literary agency, making $30,000 a year without benefits. This kind of job is not unfamiliar to anyone who has worked in publishing or journalism. It's an effective dead end: Often the only forms of advancement come from extrinsic forces. One could, as Wiener notes, move up by being able to \"[inherit] money, marry rich, or wait for peers to defect or die.\" None of these seemed likely to be happening soon, so she began to wonder if securing advance reader copies and enjoying the shabby glow of cultural capital-even while scraping to pay the rent each month-was really enough. Then one day she read an article about an e-book start-up that had raised $3 million in seed funding.5</p><p>The start-up's mild form of disruption was simple: Seeking to turn once public goods like library books into a private, curated service, it planned to offer \"access to a sprawling library of e-books for a modest monthly fee.\" For Wiener, the money that might come from working at such a company had its appeal, and this particular start-up offered the chance to retain a connection to the analog world she loved, so she wanted in. No one can live off \"taste and integrity\" alone, she tells us, and when she was offered a three-month trial run with the company, she accepted.6</p><p>Working as a kind of do-it-all assistant for the company's four-person team, Wiener spent her days not learning a new profession but instead buying the employee snacks, writing copy for the website, and trying to lend her literary taste and expertise to a group of boys who did not really seem to care all that much about books. In one pitch presentation the CEO asked the staffers to consult on, she notes-to herself-that he spelled \"Hemingway\" wrong. In the same pitch, the CEO insisted that books are not really the point of the app they're selling; they are monetizing a kind of lifestyle. As Weiner writes, the CEO and by extension his cofounders never really \"acknowledged that the reason millennials might be interested\" in buying (really renting) these experiences no longer linked to physically owning books had anything to do with \"student loan debt, or the recession, or the plummeting market value of cultural products in an age of digital distribution.\" They were just worried about making money.7</p><p>As her trial period ended, Wiener could see she was a bad fit not just with this start-up but maybe with all start-ups. She was criticized for being too nice and not assertive enough (criticisms that followed her on her journey). She wrote the e-book boys a long, heartfelt e-mail hoping to convince them that her skills were indispensable, but they let her go anyway. The guys felt bad-they meant well, after all!-and helped her parlay her experience into an interview with a start-up they thought was more exciting than their own: a data analytics company in San Francisco that industry chatter had anointed as the next unicorn.8</p><p>Wiener flew to San Francisco, and after a rather humiliating interview (she was given an LSAT practice test because the interviewer didn't have any questions for her), she landed a customer support gig that would pay her double what she made as a literary assistant. If fitting in was the problem at her first start-up job, Wiener soon realized that she had a whole new world to master: Leaving aside the strange tech lingo and office rituals, the company she was about to work for, with its sexist and often classist workplace, would reveal how rotten the Internet industry had become. The two years she eventually spent at the analytics start-up were an eye-opener not just for her; the period also charted how an industrywide, government-supported embrace of data collection rewired the US economy and redefined life both on- and offline.9</p><p>iener left New York for San Francisco at just the right moment-at least for a young person with literary aspirations. In 2013, Penguin and Random House merged to become one of the largest publishing companies in the world, employing about 10,000 people, commanding a combined value of over $2 billion, and creating a vast conglomerate that could affect the livelihoods of smaller houses, writers, and workers around the planet. But the mega publishing house was no match for what else was happening in the US economy. Not long before, Facebook went public with a valuation north of $100 billion, and Amazon facilitated one-half of all book sales. Amazon was also running an even more \"lucrative sister business,\" Wiener writes, of \"selling cloud-computing services-metered use of a sprawling, international network of server farms-which provided the back-end infrastructure for other companies' websites and apps.\" In earlier eras, this kind of infrastructure might have been built by and for the public, but now it was privately owned and rented out, making it \"nearly impossible to use the internet at all without enriching\" Amazon. In the ecosystem Wiener was about to immerse herself in, Amazon's ruthless and ingenious business model was much admired and provided a way to understand the world that start-ups were helping to create. It operated with the idea that there was no \"crisis\" in this vision of the future, \"only opportunities.\"10</p><p>Wiener's new start-up job focused on helping the data analytics company's clients troubleshoot problems with the implementation of the company's products, a powerful suite of tools designed to help websites and apps collect user data. Quickly, Wiener realized the tools for data collection weren't the only things for sale. For the company's clients, user data, as much as any of the services on offer, was itself a valuable good that could be packaged and sold. \"The right findings,\" Wiener tells us, \"could be golden, inspiring new products, or revealing user psychology, or engendering ingenious, hypertargeted advertising campaigns.\" To turn these insights into an economic windfall, the analytics start-up divided the data that its clients collected into highly granular morsels. Clients could break down and segment user engagement in a way that enabled them to predict user behavior and either sell this information to other companies or retain it for their own projects.11</p><p>The start-up's employees were expected not to snoop around the private information that they were enabling clients to collect. But by using a setting called \"God mode,\" Wiener implies, she and her colleagues could easily \"look up individual profiles of our lovers and family members and co-workers in the data sets belonging to dating apps and shopping services and fitness trackers and travel sites\" that worked with the start-up. Even if there was an ironclad rule against such prying, Wiener continues, she'd heard stories of people at other start-ups not acting with such discretion. At a ride-sharing company, employees would frequently \"search customers' ride histories, tracking the travel patterns of celebrities and politicians.\"12</p><p>With this power at her disposal, Wiener not only learned how widespread data collection had become but also began to grow a bit paranoid. \"It wasn't the act of data collection\" that gave her pause, she writes; she was already resigned to that. What disturbed her was \"the people who might see [her data] on the other end-people [like her].\" She \"never knew with whom [she] was sharing\" information, and soon she began to see how the collection was not just a business strategy but something far more dangerous. It created a wealth of unchecked power for those companies that ended up with its vatic information. If they could predict user preferences and behavior, they could also manipulate the entire economy.13</p><p>Still, in her early days at the analytics company, Wiener tried to brush away many of these fears. The money was just too good, and for the first time in her adult life she was saving and climbing a career ladder. Even when a grave new development connected Silicon Valley with the upper echelons of the US government's War on Terrorism, she didn't at first see how the work she did was implicated.14</p><p>On the day Edward Snowden's NSA leaks became public, Wiener and her coworkers weren't particularly interested: \"In general, we rarely discussed the news, and we certainly weren't about to start with this story. We didn't think of ourselves as participating in the surveillance economy. We weren't thinking about our role in facilitating and normalizing the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behavior.\" But Wiener's growing unease was vindicated. Not only corporations but our government (and others around the world) were now wielding these powers to spy on their citizens and enemies alike on a scale never seen before. \"We facilitated the collection of the information,\" a former coworker tells her, \"and we have no idea how it will be used and by whom. For all we know, we could have been one subpoena away from collaborating with intelligence agencies. If the reports are accurate, the veil between ad tech and state surveillance is very thin.\"15</p><p>After the Snowden revelations, things began to sink in for Wiener, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> tracks each step she took in connecting the dots. She moves from the rise of cloud computing (\"The idea of the cloud, its implied transparency and ephemerality, concealed the physical reality: the cloud was just a network of hardware, storing data indefinitely. All hardware could be hacked\") to the links between corporations and the US national security state (\"The servers of global technology companies had been penetrated and pillaged by the government. Some said the technology companies had collaborated wittingly\") to the terrible version of the Internet we all live with now. And while these passages can illuminate for readers the intersections they might not already know, they carry a tinge of paranoia that can veer into near-conspiracy theory. But in fairness to Wiener, she makes clear how jobs like hers incentivize people to be ignorant of the world around them. \"It was perhaps a symptom of my myopia, my sense of security, that I was not thinking about data collection as one of the moral quandaries of our time,\" she writes. \"For all the industry's talk about scale, and changing the world, I was not thinking about the broader implications. I was hardly thinking about the world at all.\"16</p><p>part from her growing fear of the dangerous implications of data collection, Wiener was also confronted with the arrogance, classism, and misogyny of Silicon Valley's workplaces. Without the aggression and petulance of a workplace culture that compared everything to conquest and brutality, she suggests, her colleagues might have paused to consider whether the products they worked on were directly connected to industry or government surveillance programs.17</p><p>At the data analytics company, in particular, Wiener got a crash course in the bullying rhetoric and office culture of the start-up world. The company's internal slogan, \"Down for the cause,\" was used to chastise her and her coworkers if they failed to live up to the vague mandates of growth and devotion. The staffers were haunted by the company's oracular CEO, an IndianAmerican college dropout who talked almost exclusively in the language of war. After one happy hour hosted by the company, a coworker attempted to grope Wiener in the backseat of a cab. Another colleague made a pass at her in the middle of the workday and told her that he \"loves dating Jewish women\" because they are \"so sensual.\" While such workplace abuses are widespread across all industries, Wiener shows how the casual misogyny and truculence of her workplace-and tech businesses in general-are two of the reasons the Internet has become an unwelcoming place for women, people of color, and those who are down and out. Having refashioned the Internet in their image, start-up executives have made it a hostile environment for everyone else.18</p><p>Wiener eventually moved on to a third start-up, where she worked as a kind of content moderator, trawling reports of \"pornography or neo-Nazi drivel\" and determining if the posters violated the company's free speech policies. For Wiener, this work proved to be the breaking point. The way her peers in tech treated San Francisco was another. On an unnamed blogging platform, a varying set of \"engineers and aspiring entrepreneurs\" captures the general mood among pigheaded tech bros there. In one post, a man compared the city's temperamental weather to \"a woman who is constantly PMSing.\" In another, a tech dude joked about \"monetizing homeless people by turning them into Wi-Fi hotspots\" and excoriated the poor for \"clinging to rent control and driving up condo prices.\" One of her first realizations about her new home-and the one that stuck with her throughout her years there-was the depth of its contrasts: \"I had never seen such a shameful juxtaposition of blatant suffering and affluent idealism.\"19</p><p>For Wiener, the city, the workplace, and the Internet had an appalling commonality. Wrapped up in the start-up machismo about disruption so prevalent in all these spaces was a stomach-churning disgust for the poor, for women, for basically anyone not employed by a tech company. The coders-many of whom were white and college-educated and were from middle-class homes-preferred a world that reflected their own comforts and needs and then projected those preferences not only into the workplaces that Wiener and many other women and people of color had to share with them but also into the technologies and surveillance tools that helped drive the economy. \"Silicon Valley might have promoted a style of individualism,\" Wiener observes, but its scale \"bred homogeneity. Venture-funded, online-only, direct-to-consumer retailers had hired chatty copywriters to speak to the affluent and overextended.... Homogeneity was a small price to pay for the erasure of decision fatigue. It liberated our minds to pursue other endeavors, like work.\"20</p><p>About four years after moving to San Francisco to enter the tech world, Wiener quit her last job there. She managed to escape with a nest egg of about $200,000 after exercising her stock options, around a year after the election of Donald Trump.21</p><p>he big-picture takeaways of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> are compelling, though they are not Wiener's alone: For the last few years, we've seen a cottage industry of books detailing the personal and political effects of surveillance capitalism and tech-world excess. But the literary texture of Wiener's narrative makes it particularly valuable as a primary document of this moment. Her voice, alternating between cool and detached and impassioned and earnest, boasts an observational precision that is devastating. It is whip smart and searingly funny, too. The book contains a six-page tour de force on Internet addiction, algorithms, and all of the attendant feelings of dread that is one of the best summations of an average day online I've ever read.22</p><p>There is also a powerful and often surprising combination of joy and ambivalence running through Wiener's story. She is careful not to say that all tech is bad, all start-up bros evil, and she marvels at the magic of both understanding and deploying a line of code. She also allows space to those who upend her preconceptions of tech culture, among them her boyfriend Ian, a Google engineer, and Patrick, an erudite young start-up founder she befriends. That Wiener squeezes all of this-along with passages on urban theory, tracts on electronic dance music, and thoughts on contemporary novels-into some 275 pages is quite a feat.23</p><p>Still, it's impossible to leave this book not feeling drained spiritually and politically, even as its wealth of knowledge helps orient the reader in a world so closely tied to the ups and downs of Bay Area billionaires. Throughout <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis>, there is a sense of crushing defeat. The world that Big Tech has given us feels almost foreordained, with few alternatives to serve as a counterweight to its dominance over the tools that facilitate everyday life. Wiener found her escape route, eventually becoming a writer for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Yorker, </emphasis>where she quickly established herself as a trenchant observer of the tech industry. In this way, one can read <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> as a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K\u00fcnstlerroman</emphasis>, a tale of our heroine returning to her literary ambitions after all. But like a lot of recent books on the hellscape that is the Internet, her personal story gives us little room to imagine how we all might escape this new, malignant, corporate-controlled space, where data collection, advertising, and surveillance are the status quo.24</p><p>For Wiener, this may be part of her goal. The clarifying anger that infuses her book also points to the larger politics that we will need if we are to make the Internet a more humane gathering place. Breaking up the Silicon Valley monopolies, unionizing their workplaces, and imposing effective new government regulations need to happen to begin fixing the Internet (and the world).

I used to work at a large multinational media corporation that desperately wanted to be a tech start-up. #8216;Data,#8217; #8216;metrics,#8217; and #8216;product#8217; were the terms du jour: They drove, however ambiguously or cynically, many of the decisions made by the magazine makers and website producers who paid me to line-edit what throughout the industry is now simply called #8216;content.#8217; The company's coders were poached from prestigious firms to build publishing-focused software, and their offices, located a few floors below ours, offered a cornucopia of amenities that exceeded those of the #8216;content producers#8217;: They had higher salaries, nicer workstations, the presumption of job security, and free snacks. </p><p>They seemed to be trusted with the future of the company, responsible for creating tools to help us publish our stories and decode the data that came back to us about our readers. In meeting after meeting, low-ranking executives, accompanied by these code jockeys, would instruct editors on how to game SEO and social media algorithms, reminding us about the need to remain vigilant in the face of an ever-changing media landscape. No one really seemed to know how to fix the ailing media company, but that didn't prevent anyone from religiously paying tithes to the very technologies undermining our shared industry.1 Ad Policy[1] Books in Review  When I wasn't at work stressing out over the ticker counters that gave value to my toil, I was still trapped in this world. I looked at my feeds when I woke up, trawling through the news, memes, and life events; I swiped between photos of strangers on dating apps; and I signed away the rights to my privacy and image with each new app I downloaded. Sometimes I would accept invitations to parties from friends on the very social media apps that were ruining my industry, and I would find myself in penthouses owned by early employees of what were known in the tech world as #8216;unicorns#8217;\u2014start-ups with a valuation of $1 billion or more. Feeling flattered and, at the same time, guilty to be invited, I would spend a lot of time gawking at the excess: free drugs, alcohol, and hired help. I would think that no one, especially no twentysomethings, should be this rich. I still partook in the luxuries on offer. Surrounded by my college-educated peers who had done the smart thing and sold out, I wondered if being an editor and writer was worth the trouble. I knew I wasn't alone in this, because a lot of my friends who came of economic age after 2008 were asking the same thing. Precarious, overeducated, and complicit in a rigged economic system we knew was undermining our own work, we wondered why we hadn't all sent in job applications to the next hot tech company. (I did, to be honest, and was rejected.)2 In Uncanny Valley, a remarkable memoir of her nearly five years working in San Francisco's start-up scene, Anna Wiener tells us what happens when you do end up in the tech world\u2014and about the anguish it has caused. A liberal-arts-educated East Coaster and erstwhile denizen of New York's literary scene, Wiener provides an achingly relatable and sharply focused firsthand account of how a set of #8216;ambitious, aggressive, arrogant young men from America's soft suburbs,#8217; backed by vast capital investments and armed with data analytics technology, helped to refashion not just our economy but also our culture, aesthetics, and politics with the new digital tools they produced.3 At the center of Wiener's narrative is a story about a generation: For her, the great innovation of the young people behind the continuing second dot-com bubble has been to persuade the rest of the world to fetishize the prophetic power of data and to get us to trade away privacy for optimization. But as an employee guiltily benefiting from this gold rush, she gives us a cautionary tale about the dangerous work cultures these tech companies cultivated as well. While warning about the collection of data and the way it reaffirms some of the most invidious forms of inequality in our society, she examines how tech companies were run on a toxic cocktail of misogyny, prejudice, and rampant surveillance. Unlike several other recent nonfiction dispatches from Silicon Valley, her book is less interested in making sense of the tech boom through the eyes and foibles of start-up founders and more concerned with asking questions from the point of view of the young people they employed. Although her memoir charts her eventual escape from this world, it also reminds us that even if we don't work in tech and refuse to engage with the world that start-ups have created, we still need something far greater than rejection to resolve these issues. In this way, Wiener's book, while not explicitly political, gives us a road map to the ways we can turn our growing dissatisfaction with what tech has wrought into the backbone of an ideology.4 Before 2013, when she plunged headfirst into the start-up scene, Wiener was an assistant at a middling Manhattan-based literary agency, making $30,000 a year without benefits. This kind of job is not unfamiliar to anyone who has worked in publishing or journalism. It's an effective dead end: Often the only forms of advancement come from extrinsic forces. One could, as Wiener notes, move up by being able to #8216;[inherit] money, marry rich, or wait for peers to defect or die.#8217; None of these seemed likely to be happening soon, so she began to wonder if securing advance reader copies and enjoying the shabby glow of cultural capital\u2014even while scraping to pay the rent each month\u2014was really enough. Then one day she read an article about an e-book start-up that had raised $3 million in seed funding.5 The start-up's mild form of disruption was simple: Seeking to turn once public goods like library books into a private, curated service, it planned to offer #8216;access to a sprawling library of e-books for a modest monthly fee.#8217; For Wiener, the money that might come from working at such a company had its appeal, and this particular start-up offered the chance to retain a connection to the analog world she loved, so she wanted in. No one can live off #8216;taste and integrity#8217; alone, she tells us, and when she was offered a three-month trial run with the company, she accepted.6 Working as a kind of do-it-all assistant for the company's four-person team, Wiener spent her days not learning a new profession but instead buying the employee snacks, writing copy for the website, and trying to lend her literary taste and expertise to a group of boys who did not really seem to care all that much about books. In one pitch presentation the CEO asked the staffers to consult on, she notes\u2014to herself\u2014that he spelled #8216;Hemingway#8217; wrong. In the same pitch, the CEO insisted that books are not really the point of the app they're selling; they are monetizing a kind of lifestyle. As Weiner writes, the CEO and by extension his cofounders never really #8216;acknowledged that the reason millennials might be interested#8217; in buying (really renting) these experiences no longer linked to physically owning books had anything to do with #8216;student loan debt, or the recession, or the plummeting market value of cultural products in an age of digital distribution.#8217; They were just worried about making money.7  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/</url> As her trial period ended, Wiener could see she was a bad fit not just with this start-up but maybe with all start-ups. She was criticized for being too nice and not assertive enough (criticisms that followed her on her journey). She wrote the e-book boys a long, heartfelt e-mail hoping to convince them that her skills were indispensable, but they let her go anyway. The guys felt bad\u2014they meant well, after all!\u2014and helped her parlay her experience into an interview with a start-up they thought was more exciting than their own: a data analytics company in San Francisco that industry chatter had anointed as the next unicorn.8 Wiener flew to San Francisco, and after a rather humiliating interview (she was given an LSAT practice test because the interviewer didn't have any questions for her), she landed a customer support gig that would pay her double what she made as a literary assistant. If fitting in was the problem at her first start-up job, Wiener soon realized that she had a whole new world to master: Leaving aside the strange tech lingo and office rituals, the company she was about to work for, with its sexist and often classist workplace, would reveal how rotten the Internet industry had become. The two years she eventually spent at the analytics start-up were an eye-opener not just for her; the period also charted how an industrywide, government-supported embrace of data collection rewired the US economy and redefined life both on- and offline.9 Wiener left New York for San Francisco at just the right moment\u2014at least for a young person with literary aspirations. In 2013, Penguin and Random House merged to become one of the largest publishing companies in the world, employing about 10,000 people, commanding a combined value of over $2 billion, and creating a vast conglomerate that could affect the livelihoods of smaller houses, writers, and workers around the planet. But the mega publishing house was no match for what else was happening in the US economy. Not long before, Facebook went public with a valuation north of $100 billion, and Amazon facilitated one-half of all book sales. Amazon was also running an even more #8216;lucrative sister business,#8217; Wiener writes, of #8216;selling cloud-computing services\u2014metered use of a sprawling, international network of server farms\u2014which provided the back-end infrastructure for other companies' websites and apps.#8217; In earlier eras, this kind of infrastructure might have been built by and for the public, but now it was privately owned and rented out, making it #8216;nearly impossible to use the internet at all without enriching#8217; Amazon. In the ecosystem Wiener was about to immerse herself in, Amazon's ruthless and ingenious business model was much admired and provided a way to understand the world that start-ups were helping to create. It operated with the idea that there was no #8216;crisis#8217; in this vision of the future, #8216;only opportunities.#8217;10 Wiener's new start-up job focused on helping the data analytics company's clients troubleshoot problems with the implementation of the company's products, a powerful suite of tools designed to help websites and apps collect user data. Quickly, Wiener realized the tools for data collection weren't the only things for sale. For the company's clients, user data, as much as any of the services on offer, was itself a valuable good that could be packaged and sold. #8216;The right findings,#8217; Wiener tells us, #8216;could be golden, inspiring new products, or revealing user psychology, or engendering ingenious, hypertargeted advertising campaigns.#8217; To turn these insights into an economic windfall, the analytics start-up divided the data that its clients collected into highly granular morsels. Clients could break down and segment user engagement in a way that enabled them to predict user behavior and either sell this information to other companies or retain it for their own projects.11  Related Article The start-up's employees were expected not to snoop around the private information that they were enabling clients to collect. But by using a setting called #8216;God mode,#8217; Wiener implies, she and her colleagues could easily #8216;look up individual profiles of our lovers and family members and co-workers in the data sets belonging to dating apps and shopping services and fitness trackers and travel sites#8217; that worked with the start-up. Even if there was an ironclad rule against such prying, Wiener continues, she'd heard stories of people at other start-ups not acting with such discretion. At a ride-sharing company, employees would frequently #8216;search customers' ride histories, tracking the travel patterns of celebrities and politicians.#8217;12 With this power at her disposal, Wiener not only learned how widespread data collection had become but also began to grow a bit paranoid. #8216;It wasn't the act of data collection#8217; that gave her pause, she writes; she was already resigned to that. What disturbed her was #8216;the people who might see [her data] on the other end\u2014people [like her].#8217; She #8216;never knew with whom [she] was sharing#8217; information, and soon she began to see how the collection was not just a business strategy but something far more dangerous. It created a wealth of unchecked power for those companies that ended up with its vatic information. If they could predict user preferences and behavior, they could also manipulate the entire economy.13  Still, in her early days at the analytics company, Wiener tried to brush away many of these fears. The money was just too good, and for the first time in her adult life she was saving and climbing a career ladder. Even when a grave new development connected Silicon Valley with the upper echelons of the US government's War on Terrorism, she didn't at first see how the work she did was implicated.14 On the day Edward Snowden's NSA leaks became public, Wiener and her coworkers weren't particularly interested: #8216;In general, we rarely discussed the news, and we certainly weren't about to start with this story. We didn't think of ourselves as participating in the surveillance economy. We weren't thinking about our role in facilitating and normalizing the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behavior.#8217; But Wiener's growing unease was vindicated. Not only corporations but our government (and others around the world) were now wielding these powers to spy on their citizens and enemies alike on a scale never seen before. #8216;We facilitated the collection of the information,#8217; a former coworker tells her, #8216;and we have no idea how it will be used and by whom. For all we know, we could have been one subpoena away from collaborating with intelligence agencies. If the reports are accurate, the veil between ad tech and state surveillance is very thin.#8217;15 After the Snowden revelations, things began to sink in for Wiener, and Uncanny Valley tracks each step she took in connecting the dots. She moves from the rise of cloud computing (#8216;The idea of the cloud, its implied transparency and ephemerality, concealed the physical reality: the cloud was just a network of hardware, storing data indefinitely. All hardware could be hacked#8217;) to the links between corporations and the US national security state (#8216;The servers of global technology companies had been penetrated and pillaged by the government. Some said the technology companies had collaborated wittingly#8217;) to the terrible version of the Internet we all live with now. And while these passages can illuminate for readers the intersections they might not already know, they carry a tinge of paranoia that can veer into near#8212;conspiracy theory. But in fairness to Wiener, she makes clear how jobs like hers incentivize people to be ignorant of the world around them. #8216;It was perhaps a symptom of my myopia, my sense of security, that I was not thinking about data collection as one of the moral quandaries of our time,#8217; she writes. #8216;For all the industry's talk about scale, and changing the world, I was not thinking about the broader implications. I was hardly thinking about the world at all.#8217;16 Apart from her growing fear of the dangerous implications of data collection, Wiener was also confronted with the arrogance, classism, and misogyny of Silicon Valley's workplaces. Without the aggression and petulance of a workplace culture that compared everything to conquest and brutality, she suggests, her colleagues might have paused to consider whether the products they worked on were directly connected to industry or government surveillance programs.17 At the data analytics company, in particular, Wiener got a crash course in the bullying rhetoric and office culture of the start-up world. The company's internal slogan, #8216;Down for the cause,#8217; was used to chastise her and her coworkers if they failed to live up to the vague mandates of growth and devotion. The staffers were haunted by the company's oracular CEO, an IndianAmerican college dropout who talked almost exclusively in the language of war. After one happy hour hosted by the company, a coworker attempted to grope Wiener in the backseat of a cab. Another colleague made a pass at her in the middle of the workday and told her that he #8216;loves dating Jewish women#8217; because they are #8216;so sensual.#8217; While such workplace abuses are widespread across all industries, Wiener shows how the casual misogyny and truculence of her workplace\u2014and tech businesses in general\u2014are two of the reasons the Internet has become an unwelcoming place for women, people of color, and those who are down and out. Having refashioned the Internet in their image, start-up executives have made it a hostile environment for everyone else.18 Wiener eventually moved on to a third start-up, where she worked as a kind of content moderator, trawling reports of #8216;pornography or neo-Nazi drivel#8217; and determining if the posters violated the company's free speech policies. For Wiener, this work proved to be the breaking point. The way her peers in tech treated San Francisco was another. On an unnamed blogging platform, a varying set of #8216;engineers and aspiring entrepreneurs#8217; captures the general mood among pigheaded tech bros there. In one post, a man compared the city's temperamental weather to #8216;a woman who is constantly PMSing.#8217; In another, a tech dude joked about #8216;monetizing homeless people by turning them into Wi-Fi hotspots#8217; and excoriated the poor for #8216;clinging to rent control and driving up condo prices.#8217; One of her first realizations about her new home\u2014and the one that stuck with her throughout her years there\u2014was the depth of its contrasts: #8216;I had never seen such a shameful juxtaposition of blatant suffering and affluent idealism.#8217;19  Related Article For Wiener, the city, the workplace, and the Internet had an appalling commonality. Wrapped up in the start-up machismo about disruption so prevalent in all these spaces was a stomach-churning disgust for the poor, for women, for basically anyone not employed by a tech company. The coders\u2014many of whom were white and college-educated and were from middle-class homes\u2014preferred a world that reflected their own comforts and needs and then projected those preferences not only into the workplaces that Wiener and many other women and people of color had to share with them but also into the technologies and surveillance tools that helped drive the economy. #8216;Silicon Valley might have promoted a style of individualism,#8217; Wiener observes, but its scale #8216;bred homogeneity. Venture-funded, online-only, direct-to-consumer retailers had hired chatty copywriters to speak to the affluent and overextended. Homogeneity was a small price to pay for the erasure of decision fatigue. It liberated our minds to pursue other endeavors, like work.#8217;20 About four years after moving to San Francisco to enter the tech world, Wiener quit her last job there. She managed to escape with a nest egg of about $200,000 after exercising her stock options, around a year after the election of Donald Trump.21 The big-picture takeaways of Uncanny Valley are compelling, though they are not Wiener's alone: For the last few years, we've seen a cottage industry of books detailing the personal and political effects of surveillance capitalism and tech-world excess. But the literary texture of Wiener's narrative makes it particularly valuable as a primary document of this moment. Her voice, alternating between cool and detached and impassioned and earnest, boasts an observational precision that is devastating. It is whip smart and searingly funny, too. The book contains a six-page tour de force on Internet addiction, algorithms, and all of the attendant feelings of dread that is one of the best summations of an average day online I've ever read.22 There is also a powerful and often surprising combination of joy and ambivalence running through Wiener's story. She is careful not to say that all tech is bad, all start-up bros evil, and she marvels at the magic of both understanding and deploying a line of code. She also allows space to those who upend her preconceptions of tech culture, among them her boyfriend Ian, a Google engineer, and Patrick, an erudite young start-up founder she befriends. That Wiener squeezes all of this\u2014along with passages on urban theory, tracts on electronic dance music, and thoughts on contemporary novels\u2014into some 275 pages is quite a feat.23 Still, it's impossible to leave this book not feeling drained spiritually and politically, even as its wealth of knowledge helps orient the reader in a world so closely tied to the ups and downs of Bay Area billionaires. Throughout Uncanny Valley, there is a sense of crushing defeat. The world that Big Tech has given us feels almost foreordained, with few alternatives to serve as a counterweight to its dominance over the tools that facilitate everyday life. Wiener found her escape route, eventually becoming a writer for The New Yorker, where she quickly established herself as a trenchant observer of the tech industry. In this way, one can read Uncanny Valley as a K\u00fcnstlerroman, a tale of our heroine returning to her literary ambitions after all. But like a lot of recent books on the hellscape that is the Internet, her personal story gives us little room to imagine how we all might escape this new, malignant, corporate-controlled space, where data collection, advertising, and surveillance are the status quo.24 For Wiener, this may be part of her goal. The clarifying anger that infuses her book also points to the larger politics that we will need if we are to make the Internet a more humane gathering place. Breaking up the Silicon Valley monopolies, unionizing their workplaces, and imposing effective new government regulations need to happen to begin fixing the Internet (and the world). Yet while she only briefly engages with the prospect of tech unionization, the entirety of the book is spent grappling with the limits of her coworkers' and her own political imagination in the face of the tools they've created. She shows us all this because she knows something has to change. Uncanny Valley may tell the story, from one woman's perspective, of how the tech industry has come close to ruining the world. But Wiener's book is also proof that it hasn't succeeded yet.25 [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy\">http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TNTN103220158013183785125876100030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2W-S6Y1-F03R-N508-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3875\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Nation Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Cloud Computing</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjkyRURBOERGNUNFNDVEQkFEQzI4QUVFRDJFNTczQ0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTJENDFFOTRERkUzNEM4RUFDNTJEQTY3QjQ1MDk5MzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp; SALARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D4VJ</classCode><className>BIG DATA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000CYWK</classCode><className>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The share prices of these companies all fell immediately.</p><p>Facebook was hit hardest, losing 1.7 per cent - though some of this could be attributed to the recent news that it was also facing a US$5 billion (NZ$7.5b) fine for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Amazon's share value dropped 1.2 per cent. Google's parent company, Alphabet, dropped 1 per cent and Apple also lost 0.4 per cent. So what brought all of this on?</p><p>The same thing that brings on most things these days. US President Donald Trump. Well, the Trump administration at least, according to a Reuters report.</p><p>The investigation does have bipartisan support, though. Democrat Senator David Cicilline, who will be heading the subcommittee, said: \"There is growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups that there is a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market with innovative products and services to challenge these incumbents.\"</p><p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook tried to claim that the company doesn't dominate any market. Hmm. Sounds a bit rich to me.</p><p>Apple wasn't alone in defending its position. Google, with its core search business - which makes up 92 per of the global market - told the House judiciary subcommittee it \"created new competition in many sectors\".</p><p>What it failed to state was that European Union regulators also fined Google US$5b last year for using Android's dominance to block competitiveness.</p><p>Facebook, and the Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp, kept schtum on the matter, despite being widely criticised for copying Snapchat's time-limited Story posts. A feature that's now available on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>There's been no immediate response from Amazon either. But just last year, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos claimed the online giant \"remains a small player in global retail\". Ha.</p><p>His rationale was that the majority of shopping still occurs offline.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disagrees. \"I think if you look at Amazon, although there are certain benefits to it, they've destroyed the retail industry across the United States so there's no question they've limited competition.\"</p><p>Does the Department of Justice have a case here? I'll let you answer that. Think of the service each of these tech giants provides and then think of a direct competitor a user can go to if they're unhappy with a brand.</p><p>Facebook's biggest rival is Instagram. Which it owns. Facebook Messenger's biggest rival is WhatsApp. And it owns that too. So it's not looking great for Mark Zuckerberg. Again.</p><p>Apple clearly has alternatives in the hardware sphere. If you don't like your iPhone, you can easily buy an Android equivalent.</p><p>However, the software side of Apple is more nuanced. Where do you turn if you don't want to use Apple's App Store? What should a (hypothetical) third-party app developer, with hundreds of employees, do if its property is suddenly removed from the App Store?</p><p>And while Amazon isn't a big thing here in New Zealand yet, it's a different beast in the US. A large chunk of users will start and end their online-shopping journey on Amazon.com.</p><p>Who's regulating how the Amazon search algorithm promotes products? Is it based on what's best for the customer, or what returns the most profit to Amazon?</p><p>Last but not least, we have Google. It has direct rivals in Bing, Yahoo and DuckDuckGo. But advertising, in search results and on web pages, is where it makes its money.</p><p>Can you think of an alternative company that offers local businesses a way to advertise their services next to relevant online content? I can't.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SSTAR-SUS19072800531149462281-DF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNM-JY01-DYTR-J1D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155918</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 \u00c2\u00a9 Stuff Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Star-Times (Auckland, New Zealand)</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And like crack addicts are to dealers, the users are the people that make the owners multibillionaires.</p><p>Five of the eight richest people in the world are owners of networks. None are Australian.</p><p>The outsized wealth of network owners is why many Australian leaders - from bank CEOs to start-up founders - are all wanting to emulate a fraction of the success of the network platform giants.</p><p>\"People love to criticise the tech giants, and there may be plenty to criticise, but every business leader would kill to have a piece of what Google, Facebook and Amazon have,\" says Richard White, CEO of ASX-listed logistics software darling WiseTech Global.</p><p>White's network savvy, particularly as it applies to understanding the physical to digital network dividend and leveraging Australian engineering talent to scale globally in the logistics space, has earned him an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion.</p><p>Winners take all</p><p>This winners-take-all \"network effect\" is as true for countries as it is for individuals and businesses.</p><p>In a regional and global context, Australia is a network user. The US and China are today's unrivalled network owners. Both are in an arms race for supremacy of a blitz-scaled world driven by big data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Yet after more than two decades, most Australian leaders have been watching this unprecedented shift from the sidelines. The generalities they proffer are a clear tell their understanding of network science and the properties that cause networks to scale or wither, remains paper thin.</p><p>\"It's a critical knowledge gap Australia needs to close. We've missed the first phase of the digital network revolution.\" says Adrian Turner, the CEO of Data61, the CSIRO's data science agency.</p><p>\"Most people are late to understanding 21st-century network scale because they don't have a good grasp of history and they have far less of a grasp of network science,\" says celebrated economic historian Niall Ferguson, a Senior Fellow of Stanford's Hoover Institution, a geopolitical think tank.</p><p>\"If you think that Lehman Bros failed because Dick Fuld [Lehman's last chairman] was an asshole, which was basically the thinking adopted at the time, you fail to see that Lehman was a hugely critical node in a highly complex network,\" says Ferguson with typical candour. \"The removal of Lehman Bros caused the whole thing to collapse.\"</p><p>We need to study-up on network science and quickly, because in the digital age, no country is an island, networks never sleep and they are highly calibrated engines for profit for the few and tribalism for the many, he says.</p><p>\"All these studies about inequality ??? Thomas Picketty [author of the best-selling book Capital in the 21st Century] missed the point entirely. The story of today's massive inequality is a story about network structure. It has far less to do with the rate of profit being higher than the rate of growth.\"</p><p>Risk of falling behind</p><p>If we don't understand network structures and theory, \"egalitarian\" Australia may be doomed to be a low-value edge player in a cut-throat networked global economy.</p><p>\"I thought that once everyone could speak freely and exchange ideas, the world was automatically going to be a better place,\" said Twitter co-founder Evan Williams. \"I was wrong about that.\"</p><p>He is not the only technocrat crying \"whoops\".</p><p>Since the revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and numerous privacy breaches and censorship snafus, Facebook CEO and chairman Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to placate angry users and regulators for the unintended negative consequences of networked social media.</p><p>\"Duh,\" says Ferguson. \"From the birth of the internet, the tech titans have uttered versions of this utopian cyber babble: 'We're all going to be Netizens, and everything will be awesome'. But networks - digital or otherwise - have always been instruments for great inequality and tribalism.\"</p><p>In his book The Square and the Tower, Ferguson looks at the world through the lens of successive network revolutions, not just industrial ones.</p><p>\"In the 15th century the chief disruptor was Martin Luther. He used the printing press to disrupt a corrupted Roman Catholic hierarchy in Europe.</p><p>\"What happened was that a Pandora's box had been opened and Europe was plunged into more than a hundred years of religious conflict, much of it staggeringly violent.\"</p><p>People as nodes</p><p>It was only the first of a succession of network propelled revolutions that followed, from the Enlightenment to the French and American revolutions to today's Silicon Valley-led digital version.</p><p>\"The Enlightenment wasn't just a revolution born of theorists and philosophers exchanging ideas. They were also networks of Freemasons and freemasonry was one of the most important hub institutions of the enlightenment. A surprising number of the US founding fathers were Masons,\" says Ferguson.</p><p>The 21st-century technocrats didn't invent networks, but they did automate and scale them. And despite calls for greater regulatory scrutiny and the break-up of big tech, they continue to do so at an alarmingly accelerated pace.</p><p>They achieve this by harnessing a deep knowledge of network science and behavioural science.</p><p>Network scientists see people as nodes. We, the nodes, have edges in terms of our relationships, and those edges connect us to other nodes. Some people have more edges than others. When you look at network structure, the thing to note is which nodes have hub-like properties and hierarchies - the highest point which all others must go through.</p><p>There are also millions of sub-networks reflecting our likes, dislikes and affiliations in sport, politics, work, parent groups and social groups.</p><p>Network and data scientists see the complex interactions and dynamics of nodes, hubs and edges in every human endeavour.</p><p>So, if you want to understand inequality, look to the winners-take-all network properties; if you want to understand financial markets, Islamic extremism or the innovation of Silicon Valley, look deep into their networks and at their hubs, spokes and edges.</p><p>Exploiting the network</p><p>Same with understanding the rise of Trump or the victory of the Brexiteers: Data science firms like Cambridge Analytica found armies of disaffected voters and weaponised them.</p><p>\"Trump brilliantly understood how to exploit the Facebook network, aided and abetted to a greater or lesser degree by the information warriors from the Kremlin network,\" says Ferguson.</p><p>Networks are everywhere, all around us and inside us. The prevalence of networks is probably why we throw the word around so casually but so often miss the important stuff, like pollsters missing the rise of Trumpism; or consistently predicting a Labor victory in the last Australian federal election.</p><p>Our brains are neural networks and while neuroscientists understand more of how the brain works, we still don't know how we arrive at an idea or an \"Aha!\" moment. Like \"innovation\", the output of many \"Aha!\" moments, the word \"network\" is overused and misunderstood.</p><p>The technocrats also know things don't go viral because they are good ideas, which is the common and dangerous assumption. Things go viral because of the properties of the network they enter. And because misery loves company.</p><p>It's also true of diseases and it turns out that ideas, good and bad, behave a lot like infectious diseases. Outrage, the inflamed language of fake news and hate speech spreads like wildfire and it is the structure of the networks that determines the speed of contagion.</p><p>As was clear in the spread of video from the Christchurch massacre, it is also impossible to control without also negatively impacting far more benign and educationally important expressions of free speech.</p><p>Australia's domestic economy is a sub-network of a super global network. But economists obsessed with macro models generally don't think about the economy as a network.</p><p>Global economy</p><p>One striking visualisation of the global networked economy is <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Harvard's Atlas of Economic Complexity.</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Since 2011, a team at Harvard has been developing and refining this data visualisation tool that maps the dynamics of global trade and ranks countries according to industrial capabilities and knowhow.</p><p>It includes data from 250 countries and territories, classified into 20 categories of goods and five categories of services. Combined, this results in coverage of over 6000 products worldwide, with coloured dots representing exports of $100 million.</p><p>Some products, like medical imaging or Swiss watches, are far more complex than others, like iron ore. The world's most complex economies are Japan, Switzerland and Germany.</p><p>How good is Australia? In terms of economic complexity, not very. It ranks 93 out of 140 countries assessed. More disturbing is that its ranking has dropped 23 places in a decade.</p><p>In a world of increasing product and market complexity the countries that show the fastest declines in the past decade have become increasingly dependent on commodities, (like Australia), or were affected by political instability or civil war.</p><p>National winners vulnerable</p><p>Our relatively low economic complexity and low penetration of international markets makes us vulnerable.</p><p>Seek Founder and venture capitalist Paul Bassett recently tweeted: \"Most of our largest companies are focused mainly on the Australia and New Zealand market [banking and retail]. But in today's world many markets are won globally not locally. As a result, our national winners and our economy are vulnerable to disruption.\"</p><p>This has been true for some time and it's starting to bite. Australia is in per capita recession with low innovation output, low internationalisation, stagnant wages and high household debt crushing consumer confidence.</p><p>We need to up our game with 21st-century skills, products that can scale globally.</p><p>There are pockets of network science expertise in Australian research and business, though this knowledge is not nearly diffused enough.</p><p>Many of the CSIRO's Data61 400-plus PhD's and researchers are experts in network science, machine learning and AI. Data61 even goes so far as to self-reference as a network and not an institution.</p><p>Federated model</p><p>But on the width and depth of the agency's interactions with business leaders about the properties of networks and how to apply them, CEO Adrian Turner he admits it does not happen nearly as often, nor as structured as he would like. But not, he says, through lack of trying.</p><p>\"To leap ahead in the next generation of the networked economy, we need to disrupt today's vertically integrated platforms with more open, federated, global data co-operatives. They allow for more participants in a value chain to share in the new value created from their data, and to train AI systems to remove the scale advantages of today's platform companies.\"</p><p>Turner says this \"federated\" model will allow access to larger-scale datasets.</p><p>This is important. Big data is critical to training artificial intelligence systems and countries with large populations and low privacy protections, like China have unassailable advantages.</p><p>A federated approach could help Australia to compete and to avoid becoming a mere colonial digital outpost of either China or the US. But it also presents enormous new complexities, not just in harnessing scarce skills and enterprise to pursue such a strategy, but also as it relates to myriad surveillance and privacy issues.</p><p>Last month, Data61's parent organisation, CSIRO, produced its four-yearly research treatise, the Australian National Outlook 2019 report. Billed as a \"Call to Arms\" for Australians, the 172-page CSIRO/NAB ANO models alternative futures for Australia to 2060.</p><p>The ANO offers a binary choice: a business-as-usual path of slow decline, or a collective effort toward something called the Outlook Vision.</p><p>No prizes for guessing which future the CSIRO, NAB and its 21 additional partner companies - consultancies, think tanks and NGOs - want us to embrace.</p><p>But how we get there is unclear. The report has no policy recommendations or specific milestones and action items to pursue or monitor.</p><p>Science meets business</p><p>When launching the ANO report, CEO Larry Marshall crowed it was a product of \"science meets business\".</p><p>But the platitudinal language of the report demands a giant leap of faith. It conveys a sense that science has been captured by the wishful thinking of legacy and domestic oriented businesses rather than science and tech-driven megatrends pushing businesses out into the world.</p><p>\"Although not modelled, the Outlook Vision assumes inclusive economic institutions and markets, defined on the basis of participant feedback and existing literature, supported by a broader cultural shift,\" the report states.</p><p>\"These inclusive institutions encourage people to participate in a choice of vocations that make the best use of their skills, create opportunities for all, regardless of their social and economic status at birth, and improve living standards while fairly sharing the benefits of increased prosperity.\"</p><p>Most glaringly, there was barely a mention of the structure and science of different network models and how Australia may build the kind of next-generation networks Data61's Turner mentioned above.</p><p>The two primary phases of network disruption between the first phase in the 15th-century printing press era and the second 1970s phase with the birth of the personal computer were separated by a return to hierarchy in the late 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p>Why? Because the technology of the period - steamship lines, railroads, the telegraph and telephone favoured centralised control.</p><p>\"It wasn't just in the communist world. Everything was hierarchical,\" says Ferguson. \"In the mid-20th century, every corporation wanted an organisation chart like Alfred Sloan's for General Motors\"</p><p>The rise of Silicon Valley in the 1970s happened not just because of the technology but because the existing hierarchy was weak. The commercial internet flourished because the US government had little interest in innovating it beyond its research origins, allowing the venture capital and private tech sector to have at it.</p><p>\"There was also a Soviet internet at the same time, but it failed because of Soviet hierarchy. It's a crucial story in the book,\" says Ferguson.</p><p>Reason to be unsettled</p><p>China's 21st-century communist hierarchy is hell-bent on not repeating that mistake. Its aggressive digital and AI-driven global expansion ambitions have deeply unsettled the US.</p><p>It should unsettle Australians too. Although the rhetoric of today's big tech titans speaks of a flat world full of opportunity for all, the fact is that the global network platforms originating in both the US and China are highly centralised.</p><p>Australia is wedged, economically and geopolitically, between a tech war between these network superpowers. The intractable issues in the current trade war are about intellectual property rights and theft and technology transfer restrictions and obligations. We confront a choice between two worlds, says Ferguson. Neither very appealing.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley's world in which data are available indirectly to the highest bidder because everything is about is essentially about advertising revenue; and a Chinese model in which everything is about maintaining the power of the Communist Party and your data are available on-demand to Xi Jinping. That's not a great choice.\"</p><p>History shows us that creating mass interconnectedness is not going to bring universal harmony to the world. It all comes down to friction between squares and towers and the relationships between networks and hierarchies.</p><p>How it turns out for Australia, a culture that has long believed in a social contract based on egalitarianism and the fair go is ours to answer.</p><p>The CSIRO ANO report was right to say a future prosperous Australia requires a cultural and intellectual shift. But just how do we maintain our democratic roots and values in a winners-take-all networked economy that we have had little role in designing and scaling is the key question of our time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520160695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-19R1-JBJ7-N0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2758\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Quiet roads, empty skies and family bike rides have replaced the constant pounding of 21st century life. Where complaints about politics and policy, boredom and balance are overridden by an incomparable gratitude for good health. But it's an uneasy tranquillity. One that is disrupted with every death announcement, technological malfunction or glimpse of a shuttered shop which some fear may never reopen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On an individual level coronavirus is having catastrophic consequences that stretch beyond the immediate health issues. In Britain, the fallout from lockdown is filtering through the economy, starting with the retail, hospitality and leisure industries and rippling up the property and banking sectors. Unemployment is rising and threatens to explode when the government's unfathomably expensive furlough scheme is inevitably lifted. Public sector employees - among them those who are providing life-saving services at the peak of the pandemic - will pay for the spending splurge with salary freezes in the years ahead.</p><p>But just as Captain Tom battled personal challenges to walk 1,000 laps of his garden (and in doing so warmed the hearts of a nation), there are plenty of encouraging stories of fortitude in business: gyms that have gathered new members by offering online classes; restaurants offering delivery services for the first time; a return in demand for local corner shops; and the farm that made more money in April 2020 by loaning its goats for entertainment in online conference calls than it did in April 2019 when it merely offered traditional farm visits.</p><p>Covid-19 has magnified weakness and exposed opportunities. That is why this crisis could be the first since the second world war with the potential for 'creative destruction' - the term used by economist Joseph Schumpeter in the 1940s to describe innovation as a means of ripping up the status quo to make way for something better.</p><p>Schumpeter used Henry Ford's moving assembly line - which resulted in a dramatic reduction in the cost of manufactured goods and laid the path towards modern consumer culture - as an example of entrepreneurship at its finest. Creative destruction has since been used to describe any innovation that paves the way for a better way of operating: Amazon (US:AMZN) and automated warehouses, for example; Netflix (US:NFLX) and the shift to content streaming; 3D printers and their potential to render global supply chains worthless.</p><p>It is true that destruction doesn't necessarily give way to creativity and innovation. On too many occasions, policymakers and corporations have failed to constructively rebuild when weaknesses have been exposed by trauma. But sometimes trauma (such as that caused by a major pandemic) provides a muchneeded catalyst for innovation.</p><p>Coronavirus has exposed gaping holes that need to be repaired. Applying the same sticking plasters used time and again to fix new wounds won't work. To build a better world in the wake of the destruction left by coronavirus, we need a change in thinking.</p><p>Economics from history Starting with the economy. Government responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have been monumental. The fiscal measures (government spending and tax cuts) to help businesses and families passed by US Congress will cost $2.2 trillion (\u00a31.81 trillion). Finance ministers from the European Union approved a half-trillion-euro fiscal package, bringing economic support by the EU and member states to (EURO)3.2 trillion (\u00a32.87 trillion) in aggregate.</p><p>When announcing the UK government's \u00a3330bnworth of support for businesses, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak noted it was an intervention unprecedented in peacetime. The eventual cost to the UK government of all measures, including its furlough scheme to pay workers put on leave, is still to become clear. In 2020 alone, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates government borrowing could be \u00a3177bn - more than treble the estimate before the crisis.</p><p>Questions are now, rightly, being asked about the source of all this capital and how long it will take to pay back. In the UK, the extraordinary spending is a worrying reminder of the 2008 financial crisis, when the government borrowed heavily and then attempted to stimulate the shattered economy by slicing interest rates and initiating a quantitative easing programme. True, the banking sector was saved and is today arguably more stable than it was prior to the crisis, but the overriding outcome of the repair was 10 years of austerity and sluggish growth.</p><p>Once again, monetary and fiscal measures are not the answer to the country's economic challenges. Central bank base rates were already so low before the pandemic that further cuts aren't expected to provide much stimulus. Quantitative easing is also not the solution when demand has fallen just as rapidly as supply - there is no point in making it easy for people to spend their money if they are in lockdown. Meanwhile, austerity might succeed in bringing down the national debt, but it won't help stimulate growth.</p><p>There is also an individual economic fallout to consider. Base rate cuts and quantitative easing won't help the millions of workers who are facing job losses as the companies they work for scramble to save cash, or the private business owners who have had to close for good. Talk of V-shaped or U-shaped economic recovery is futile if continued austerity stunts consumer spending and cannibalises growth for another decade. Ministers can learn a lot from the UK's post-war economic boom. In the late 1940s Britain's debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio peaked at over 230 per cent. But rather than clamp down on spending, investment increased in the post-war years, catalysed by the formation of the welfare state and the National Health Service (NHS). And as government spending as a percentage of GDP rose steadily, national economic growth went with it. The same was true in the US where the benefits of President Roosevelt's 'New Deal' helped drag the country out of the Great Depression.</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious examples of post-war economic creative destruction come from Germany and Japan - two countries severely shaken by the fallout of war. Without the burden of policymakers or lobbyists, entrepreneurship and innovation thrived, leading to two of the strongest industrial economies of the post-war world.</p><p>The Green New Deal But innovative industrialisation isn't the answer to the economic concerns of the 21st century. Today, economists are troubled by uncontrollable population growth, resource competition and their role in exacerbating inequality and damaging the environment. It has taken a global pandemic and strict lockdown measures to reveal just how fragile the global economic system is. The threat of repeated virus outbreaks in a world where frequent international travel has become the norm raises questions about the role of globalisation and international supply chains.</p><p>The response, argues economist Joseph Stiglitz, should be greater investment in green initiatives that not only help rebuild, but \"transform the economy into the 21st century kind of economy that we need\". Mr Stiglitz is a strong advocate of a Green New Deal, which aims to address the issues of climate change and inequality to help stimulate the US economy, just as Roosevelt's New Deal did after the War. Closer to home, climate ministers from several member countries (now including France and Germany) are calling for the EU-wide stimulus packages to emphasise the transition to clean energy in a post-coronavirus world.</p><p>But perhaps policy is not as crucial in the war on climate change as we once thought. The rapid mobilisation against the coronavirus certainly raises questions about the lethargy in action against rising global temperatures, which the World Health Organisation links to an estimated 150,000 deaths per year. If governments are willing to leave themselves further indebted to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, in what amounts to a war effort against Covid-19, why has the possibility of a climate Armageddon been met so meekly by comparison? The difference is summarised by EDHEC-Risk Institute finance professor Riccardo Rebonata: \"Covid-19 is a very 'clear and present danger', and this creates a dynamic of strong and ready political acceptance, very different from a 'slow-burning' problem such as climate change.\" Urgency, therefore, rather than policy is crucial to shifting the trajectory of global temperatures. Research from the London School of Economics argues that we should be moving away from the narrative of hardship and disaster that has dominated climate talks for several decades and instead focus on innovation, growth and investment opportunities. Emphasis of the universal benefits of green initiatives beyond climate impacts could also help shift behaviour: reduction in emission of air pollutants to improve respiratory health, more green space in cities and better walking and cycling routes for fun and commuting. Coronavirus has highlighted that we can exist in a world that is more carbon friendly. Sure, we're not going to be maintaining all the same behaviours that we have during lockdown, but demand for travel, especially for work, could reduce significantly in the 'new future'. Global populations might be more open to new work and travel solutions in the post-coronavirus world. The opportunities for innovation in the war on climate change is arguably more exciting than it has ever been.</p><p>And recent co-operation between governments and companies in the war on coronavirus is encouraging in terms of what is possible. The social impact finance team at legal firm Reed Smith notes how the likes of home appliance maker Dyson and the Mercedes Formula One team have helped design and manufacture ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients. Diageo (DGE) has used its expertise in alcohol to increase supply of antiviral hand wash. Burberry (BRBY) has been producing gowns for nurses and doctors. This collaboration could set a precedent for dealing with climate change.</p><p>Viruses can spread west It's not just the health of the planet that has been thrown into sharper focus by the coronavirus. Human health has unsurprisingly become a central concern as, for the first time in over a century, the western world faces a brand new medical threat.</p><p>That's not to say that pandemics are a new concept. Indeed, epidemiologists have been warning that international travel and global supply chains have threatened to facilitate the spread of an infectious disease for many decades. We have also had plenty of warning - swine and bird flu hit western shores in the mid-2000s, and the catastrophic consequences of Ebola in western Africa in 2014 captured global attention. The question is therefore pressing: why were we not better prepared? Perhaps the containment measures of recent virus outbreaks lulled western populations into a false sense of security. Accusations of unnecessary panic in the wake of swine flu and bird flu might explain why government responses in both the UK and US were delayed and confused. Control and containment measures have often felt sudden and reactive rather than carefully planned. Poor availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators for hospitals has revealed how reliant some western healthcare systems are on global supply. Coronavirus has offered those systems an opportunity to reassess their operations. One thing is clear, rainy day preparations need a complete rethink.</p><p>It's no accident that some of the best responses to Covid-19 have come from countries in Southeast Asia, where the Sars and Mers outbreaks are a recent and painful memory. Local populations were quick to heed their governments' warnings about hygiene and social distancing. Testing and tracking - the two measures the British government is scrambling to put in place - were already in use in regions such as Hong Kong and Singapore and have helped to control infection and death rate. And that has added a new dimension to the argument about use of personal data.</p><p>The changing face of big tech When 2020 started, the biggest cloud hanging over the US tech sector was potential regulation. Alphabet (US:GOOGL) executives were expected to spend most of the year answering questions about how it uses people's data (in the same way Mark Zuckerberg did in 2019). Amazon was being hammered for monopolising industries and consumers were worried about Alexa listening to conversations. Social media sites were being criticised for using individual data to make money and failing to clamp down on the spread of misinformation.</p><p>Much has changed in a few short months. We're now talking about Google's increasing role in education, Amazon delivering vaccines, Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Apple (US:AAPL) tracking the spread of coronavirus around the world. Meanwhile, these companies aren't taking a penny from embattled governments. Their cash position means they can give freebies to struggling customers and money to help the coronavirus effort. In a crisis, cash-rich, data experts are the type of companies we want. The pandemic therefore offers an opportunity to reset how we think about technology and the responsible use of data.</p><p>Personal, anonymised data tracking is currently being used predominantly by advertisers, but its potential use stretches far beyond its current capacity. Data will help us reopen economies faster in the wake of coronavirus, keep tabs on future surges, and help distribute PPE and ventilators better. It is true that we need to be very careful about putting our data in the hands of a few conglomerates,. But rather than regulate it, perhaps we should be spending money protecting it - better telecoms networks which don't rely on Chinese state-funded companies and government-funded cyber security could ease the concerns surrounding company data use.</p><p>The response of big US tech companies during the coronavirus has also added a new dimension to the debate around monopolistic powers. Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft have all faced regulatory pressure in the past few years for their dominant roles in their respective industries. But no one is complaining about how those dominant roles have allowed them to generate such lofty profits that they are able to support us all in times of catastrophe. Meanwhile, companies across many tightly regulated industries, including telecoms and airlines, have relied on taxpayer-funded support to help them through coronavirus and the subsequent economic fallout.</p><p>Schumpeter argued that monopolies were a way of emboldening innovation. Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet provide clear evidence of that. All three have monopolised their own industries and the retail, software and advertising markets respectively have provided them with extraordinary profits. Those profits have in turn been ploughed into innovation. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are therefore going toe-to-toe in some of the most creative areas of technology - cloud computing and artificial intelligence, for example. Their profits have allowed them to compete fiercely for a breakthrough in 'the next big thing'. Thus, in the wake of coronavirus perhaps we should all be focusing on the new rather than desperately trying to protect the old. The breadth of industries that could benefit from creative destruction is reflective of the scale of the damage caused by coronavirus and the number of industries whose imperfections have been magnified by a major trauma.</p><p>The world that is waiting for us on the other side of coronavirus could be very different to the one we have left. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing.</p><p>'Economists are troubled by uncontrollable population growth, resource competition and their role in exacerbating inequality and damaging the environment'</p><p>Green investing is about more than just a fuzzy feeling</p><p>In the past few years, a hunt for altruism in a market that seemed to be on a never-ending mission upwards has sparked a rise in demand for</p><p>ethical investing. Companies are being given scores which reveal how well their environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles align with United Nations goals. Fund managers, ratings agencies and index providers have packaged up these companies into new products for investors. Sceptics have often called it a marketing method for a period of strong market growth.</p><p>But although there are undoubtedly limits to what ESG investing can achieve, its principles could provide the basis for a real shift in the way we think about investing. For example, bad ESG scores have the potential to force up the cost of long-term borrowing on bond markets and will reduce the price a company can issue new shares for on the equity markets (which means it costs the company a greater share of its business to raise the same sum of money). If the cost of capital is increasing because a company is recognised to cause externalities that hurt the</p><p>environment and society, then it has a real incentive to improve. During the Covid-19 pandemic, companies that score well on ESG have tended to suffer less badly in the dips. Research by the Bank of America noted that the top fifth of S&amp;P 500 stocks by ESG score had by 25 March outperformed their peers in 2020 by 5 per cent. Going forwards, many of the old companies with less sustainable business models in terms of their environmental and social impact, are facing further challenges thanks to the legacy the coronavirus and measures to</p><p>combat it will leave. The companies with better ESG scores won't be immune to some of the same problems, but they are less likely to be weighed down by increases to their cost of capital. By investing in such businesses, investors can help reduce the cost of funding for companies that play a positive role in society and the struggle against climate change. Combined with</p><p>a proactive role by government and lessons on public-private partnerships learned fighting Covid-19, doing good for your portfolio can also help save the planet. JN</p><p>Covid-19 and the response to it has left a trail of destruction. Lives have been lost or permanently altered. Economies are bruised, job losses have soared and public sector deficits are set to serve as an unpleasant reminder of the trauma for many years to come. Many are now asking what comes next, and whether life will ever be quite the same again.  ;  ;  But from the rubble of the destruction, opportunities are emerging to rebuild economies, industries and systems with new and innovative ways of thinking, as has been done so repeatedly in the past: towns that rebuild better after earthquakes, or Japan and Germany's thriving post-war economies, or business innovations such as Henry Ford's assembly line or Microsoft's Windows operating system.  ;  ;  In exposing many of the weaknesses in the world's healthcare, economic and financial systems, the virus has offered both the opportunity to build back better and a roadmap for how we may do that. Companies and countries with the nerve to take those chances and create a new and improved future are likely to be well rewarded. Destruction can clear the path to innovation.  ;  ;  In a new series of fortnightly features, we will be looking on a sector-by-sector basis - from healthcare to financial services - at how investors can navigate this simultaneously exciting and disruptive change that the world needs.  ;  ;  Welcome to The New Future.  ;  ;</p><p>'Creative destruction has been used to describe any innovation that paves the way for a better way of operating: Amazon and automated warehouses, for example'  ;

FOUNDER FRANK LUNTZ </p><p>MICROSOFT PRESIDENT BRAD SMITH </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CALIF.), MINORITY LEADER </p><p>AXIOS CO-FOUNDER MIKE ALLEN </p><p>[*]ALLEN: Welcome to this Axios virtual event. I'm Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios. Welcome to my home in Arlington, Virginia. I'm looking out my window, the Key Bridge into Georgetown. This is the second of two events that we are doing of Microsoft on the future of employability during the Republican National Convention. We thank Microsoft for making these conversations possible and we thank you for taking a break during this busy newsy week to join us on Axios.com, to join us on Axios on Twitter with hashtag #axiosevents, on Facebook, and on YouTube. </p><p>Our first guest, Dr. Frank Luntz is someone whose advice is craved by corporations, candidates, and office holders on every continent. I've been to conferences, seminars, he's extremely popular. He's well known for his international bestseller Words that Work, Frank Luntz, thank you for joining Axios. </p><p>LUNTZ: Mike, it's an honor, it's a pleasure, and what we're going to talk about really does matter. </p><p>ALLEN: Well, thank you. Again getting the Axios lingo there. One this is one of the great serendipities. You and I were talking and it turned out you've done some real intense research on our exact topic today, which is the importance of broadband, the importance of tech and lifelong learning and one of the ways you think about it is getting people to think about the difference between a job and a career. </p><p>LUNTZ: We did a project, a major national project for working nation, and that organization is devoted, really focused on making a difference in teaching workers that they have to be skilled, they have to be trained for the careers of the future. And I think what makes working nation different is that it is completely nonpartisan, as is the issue.  </p><p>Whether you're talking about broadband for young people to get them started on the information superhighway or you're talking about lifelong learning, which adults appreciate and are beginning to not only understand but embrace, that this is not a political issue. This is not a partisan issue and this is not based on income or education. That any worker at any time could lose their job because of automation or because of globalization or outsourcing and that you have to be prepared and that elected officials on the federal and state and local level have a responsibility to provide these programs so that people do and are able to make a difference in their lives. </p><p>And you mentioned the difference between job and career. And I don't know if you've got that statistic in front of you, but it's one of the great findings of the working nation survey. The idea that we think we have a job by 50 to 45 percent, but what we really want by 3 to 1 is a career. A job is something you go to from 9:00 to 5:00. A career is something you do 24/7. A job is something you're looking for the next one. A career is something that you love and embrace and you want to stay with it. </p><p>ALLEN: Frank, one thing that you've done is talk to people about the difference between the good life and the American dream. What's the distinction people make there and how does access to broadband, future education play into that? </p><p>LUNTZ: Well, it's one of the reasons why this conversation is so timely. The consequence of COVID-19 is that there's been so much job and career dislocation, that people are not working in the office anymore, that sampled some people who thought they'd be protected have not been. And to me, the importance is about planning. It's about knowing that you can't--it's knowing the unknown, as Donald Rumsfeld used to say.  </p><p>And the working nation study is designed to help policymakers, designed to help businesses together, working together to ensure that we are prepared for any contingency so that young people have access to broadband so they can do their learnings, they can follow the lessons, they can read what they need to read and learn what they need to know to be competitive and to be prepared for college, career, and life and that working adults are prepared for any eventuality and that they actually embrace the future.  </p><p>And I think that's important. This is not a challenge for today at the Republican convention. This is a challenge for evermore and it's with the Republicans, Democrats, independents, whether you live in a rural community or the most urban of communities. These are things that affect all of us.  </p><p>ALLEN: Frank, your second slide looks at the fact that for those who don't have the right training, there could be so real serious unemployment based on outsourcing and automation. What's interesting is people really don't know who to blame, right? Just sort of walk us through your findings there. </p><p>LUNTZ: It's interesting to me that while globalization is one of the most discussed and polarizing issues and at both sides, both Republicans and Democrats try to turn it into an issue, what we learn from the working nation poll is that automation was a greater concern and outsourcing is number one. And we see this--we've become a global economy that there are some jobs and careers that aren't just simply easier to outsource, easier to fill in a global environment. </p><p>But that is no excuse for not getting the skills training, for not getting like long learning. And one of the--one of the aspects that is so essential is a politicians need to know the language that the public will respond to. And businesses need to provide those opportunities that the politicians and the government cannot do.  </p><p>And Mike, I want to emphasize that this is not just an issue nationwide. Governors have a role to play. Mayors have a role to play. And in the end, individuals themselves have a responsibility to get the skills they need for the careers that they want.  </p><p>ALLEN: Frank this is the most exciting part, the most interesting, juicy part. On this topic, what are the words that work and what are the words that bomb? How should companies, public officials, leaders be talking about this? </p><p>LUNTZ: Well, that's where the good life comes in. To a lot of people, the American dream is just that, a dream. But the good life has a different definition to it for some people. It's--it's a Sam Adams on the weekend. For other people, it's the right car or the right holiday. But what always matters is the idea that through systems like we have right now, through online training, through person to person skills providing, through conversations like you and I are having right now, that provides the basics for what we need to learn and what we want to know.  </p><p>And the idea that lifelong learning beats every other phrase for describing what this process is and I'm eager that we teach young people that high school is just a step towards college or towards career training and once you graduate from college that's just a step towards the first job you have and once you have that job, that's just the stepping stone to the career that you want, that this is a seamless progression and that we realize that no matter what decade we're in, and I'm in my 50s, that I still have things to learn, I still have skills to enjoy, and that whatever job or career I have right now may be radically different than what I have in the future, but that's okay. In fact, I think we should embrace this it.  </p><p>Working Nation is working with Republicans and Democrats working with the Congress, mayors, and governor is to ensure that we have a different mindset, and that's why I'm so grateful to be on this call that Microsoft sponsored because they are a great example of a company that is deeply involved in making the difference for their workforce so that they will be more successful for the long term. </p><p>ALLEN: And Frank, as we say goodbye, you've been going to the White House is more times than you could ever count, but at the end of the Republican National Convention, you're going to be there at the White House for President Trump's acceptance speech. What are you going to be listening for? What should we be watching for? </p><p>LUNTZ: Well you know, I'm a journalist in addition to being a practitioner and a pollster. And it was important to me that my Twitter followers embrace this. So I asked them yesterday 7500 interviews, more than 7500, 68 percent said go. Thirty-two percent say no. So I got on a plane last night. I'm here in Washington right now and I want to see if Donald Trump learns anything from Melania Trump's speech.  </p><p>It was very highly regarded by the left and the right. CNN embraced what she had to say and how she said it because she showed heart. She expressed her condolences and her sympathies for those who have suffered with or even lost their lives because of COVID. We all know that Donald Trump is tough. The question is how big is his heart? And I'm going to be listening for whether he demonstrates empathy tonight rather than just strength tonight.  </p><p>ALLEN: Frank Luntz, thank you for those words that work. Your Twitter feed at Frank Luntz is an awesome place to follow the convention. Frank Luntz, thank you for joining Axios.  </p><p>LUNTZ: Mike Allen, it was an honor. </p><p>ALLEN: We'd like to thank Microsoft for making these conversations possible. Our next guest is Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft. He's the chief legal officer. He has an empire of 1400 people in 56 countries. He's a big ideas guy. Brad Smith, welcome to Axios. </p><p>SMITH: Well, thanks, Mike. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. </p><p>ALLEN: Well Brad, it says you're in Redmond, Washington. You're supposed to be in Charlotte with me. Quite a change in the plans for the convention. And I know that you have been at many recent conventions and Microsoft and technology have really played quite a role for both party's conventions. </p><p>SMITH: Well, I think these conventions play such an important role in American politics. Really, they're part of our culture. They've been a fundamental part of our history, if you just think about what happened in Chicago in 1860 when the Republican Party surprised everyone by nominating Abraham Lincoln.  </p><p>Over the last 20 years, technology has played a vital role. They made the conventions more accessible to the American public. They made so many of these things more interactive. That's why I was in Tampa in 2012 and Cleveland in 2016. We've been playing an important role in supporting the conventions. I had hoped to be in Charlotte this week.  </p><p>ALLEN: So Brad, since I didn't have to travel, I had a little extra time so I curled up with a book. I curled up with this book. It's a great book. I recommend it. Tools and Weapons. This of course is Brad's book. And in there, you write about rural broadband. And Brad, you talk about rural broadband--broadband as the electricity of the 21st century. Do tell. </p><p>SMITH: Well first of all, I think it's right to think about broadband as the electricity of our age. If you want to use a telehealth service, you need broadband. If you want to take a Community College course online, you need broadband. If you're a small business and you want to grow and you want to create jobs, frankly, you've got to be in a place that has access to broadband. But in so many of our rural communities in the United States today, that is missing.  </p><p>We have to close the broadband gap. It's why we are really passionate about it. Perhaps especially in the rural parts of our country because I think without this, we're just going to miss out on the opportunity to create the opportunities for people that they deserve. </p><p>ALLEN: And Brad, I think we have a picture of a truck showing some of the work that's being done in the field, showing some of the ways that the technology is being pioneered. Tell us about this fancy truck.  </p><p>SMITH: Well, this captures a visit to one of our favorite places. Carol Ann Browne, my coauthor and I, we both work at Microsoft and this is in Ferry County in Northeastern Washington State. It's like a number of really beautiful parts of the United States. It is more rural. There is no broadband, or there was I should say there was no broadband until Microsoft worked with partners.  </p><p>And specifically, that truck, I think it sort of reflects the best of American ingenuity. We provided a grant, but the person who put that truck together is one of the three County commissioners in Ferry County. And he used it to drive her around and literally test whether he could get a good connection with the TV white spaces technology that we have been helping to advance. This is basically wireless technology that uses terrestrial television, that part of the spectrum.  </p><p>So just remember, for everybody who grew up with sort of a TV antenna or rabbit ears, you could get a good signal. Well, now we can use unused parts of that spectrum for broadband and we partnered with another company. They've created now a device that is sort of the receiver. You just put it on the side of your house and it can connect with an antenna that's 10 or 15 miles away. You then bring a cable into your house and you have Wi-Fi at broadband speeds.  </p><p>This is what rural America needs either with this kind of technology or some other. It's actually I just think a fundamental importance to put the entire country on a level playing field in terms of real economic growth.  </p><p>ALLEN: Yeah, you can see how that would be life changing especially I think of a family with young kids. I think we also might have a shot inside the truck just to give a little sense of what happens inside there. </p><p>SMITH: Yeah, this was great. I had the opportunity to learn first-hand. Look, this also reflects I think the best of almost America and do it yourself electronic engineering because what you see there is a Windows laptop and you know it is amazing what, you know, people with a little bit of financial support can go accomplish when you give them the ability to be creative. And that's what's happening in Ferry County, that is what is happening increasingly in rural counties across the country.  </p><p>ALLEN: And Brad, some people had talked about COVID as sort of an X Ray on our society. You are way ahead on this issue, but I think we realize now with so much remote learning what a massive life changing imperative broadband becomes. </p><p>SMITH: I think that's very true. I mean, look, right now you actually can't go to school virtually in an effective way if you don't have access to broadband and you don't have a good computing device. There will obviously come a day when this pandemic will be behind us when kids will be back in class, in school buildings.  </p><p>But even when that happens, there is a huge homework gap that we need to close and we need to live in a country where every student can access all the resources needed to do research, to do homework, to collaborate with other people. So even post-COVID, I think the importance of the broadband gap is not going to abate one bit. It will remain just as important to our future as it is right now. </p><p>ALLEN: By the way, Brad, you said two of the most beautiful words in the English language, two words I haven't heard in quite a while, and that is post-COVID. We've got a hope, right? </p><p>SMITH: Well look, I think this is a time not to think not only about what we need to do now but what we want to do next. And what we should be doing is not just rebuilding, but re-imagining the kind of country in which we want to live. The day will come when this is behind us. None of us knows for certain when the day will arrive, but the sooner we start envisioning what we want to build, the more we can harness the free market, call on small businesses, give them what they need to succeed. I think the better off we're going to be as a nation. </p><p>ALLEN: So Brad, you're not in Charlotte, but you have an exciting project going on there. You have a smart city initiative going on in Charlotte. And one of the big investments intentions of this investment was to help close the digital divide.  </p><p>SMITH: Yeah, Charlotte is an important city for Microsoft. North Carolina is an important state for us as a company because we have thousands of employees who work in Charlotte, they support people across The United States. We invested last year more than $20 million to expand our presence in Charlotte. We--we're adding over 200 new employees and part of what we want to do is not just grow our employee presence, but really strengthen our commitment to the city and the state.  </p><p>And you know, what we're doing in North Carolina is a part of what we're doing across the country. Specifically, we are bringing free digital learning opportunities to people. People, perhaps especially, who are looking either to find a new job who may have lost their job, or just wanted to progress in their own career.  </p><p>So we've combined access to free resources online, low-cost tests and certifications so people can show employers what they've mastered. One of my favorite things through LinkedIn, which Microsoft owns is we created, you know, new courses. So if somebody wants to sort of get better about interviewing for a job through a PC they can take a course on sort of tips on how to do a better job of interviewing and then we even have artificial intelligence that will give people feedback about how they did so people can practice and learn. And I think that's just, you know, one example of how we can put digital technology to work to frankly help people succeed in the current environment and add to the digital skills there likely should need to be successful in the decade ahead.  </p><p>ALLEN: Brad, I'm getting the hook here, but real quick, I wanted to squeeze this in. As I read about the Charlotte project, what I was most excited about was smart transit. Can you just give us one sense about smart transit? </p><p>SMITH: Well, when you think about it, we live in a world where data can help us with almost everything we do. It can promise you know, called cities, manage their transportation infrastructure, it can help individuals do a better job of avoiding traffic jams, at least in the days when people are driving more again and going back to the office, you know, just if you think about what it means to have a smart city. You know, we're all going to want, what we're going to see in the coming decade is a transportation infrastructure that is guided by data and I think especially for the public sector to build and maintain a transportation network. This can be a game changer. </p><p>ALLEN: And Brad, as we say goodbye at the end of our newsletter can we always like to have one fun thing, end on a lighter note and not many of us had had a guest off of airplane lately? You had an actual guest who got off an actual plane.  </p><p>SMITH: Well, I was really fortunate. My father came to visit in the Seattle area this past weekend. It was great to have a guest in the house. He lives in southeastern Wisconsin. Yeah, we're all having to be very careful and, you know, be very safe, but at the same time, I think my father, my family, like so many American families we're yearning for a little bit of that normalcy that defined our lives before the year 2020 began. </p><p>ALLEN: Brad, for those who care about the Internet and society and technology, we all do, your Twitter feed is great. It's Brad Smith. And I should mention that your LinkedIn is also Brad Smith. And so Brad Smith of Microsoft, thank you very much for a great conversation. </p><p>SMITH: Sure. B-R-A-D-S-M-I. I look forward to connecting with people. Thank you as always, Mike.  </p><p>ALLEN: Thank you for joining Axios. And now, batting cleanup, the House Republican Leader, Kevin McCarthy is a California. He's very wired into the Silicon Valley community. He is a tech early adopter himself. He's the real deal. Native Bakersfieldian, fourth generation from Kern County. Grandson of a cattle rancher, some of environment, and as if he doesn't have enough titles already, for in this week, he is chairman of the Republican National Convention. Mr. Leader, Mr. Chairman, welcome to Axios. </p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you so much for having me. Glad to be back.  </p><p>ALLEN: So does it being chairman give you some great perks? </p><p>MCCARTHY: You know, you've got to work and do a lot, but I did get it one big part. I got this big gavel, so I like that. I got a little gift. </p><p>ALLEN: And that's Reagan behind you, right?  </p><p>MCCARTHY: That's Reagan behind me and then some pictures of my family. I love Reagan. You know if you ever wondered what this--the painting of Reagan is in color and he's smiling because if Reagan would tell conservatives anything, to be a happy conservative. If you believe your policies bring people more freedom and liberty, don't be angry about it. Be happy about it. And I think that's coming forward in this convention this week. It's been very good.  </p><p>ALLEN: That's good advice for all of us. I mentioned you're an early adopter. And early on in this pandemic, you ordered a couple of dozen fitness trackers. You found an innovative use for them. Do tell. Do show.  </p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, it is called a Whoop. Whoop.com. It's a company, a wearable. But what I found with this, it measures your sleep, it measures everything about your body. But you can tell by your respiratory, the changing of your respiratory rate, and that's an early indication of COVID. Even a couple days earlier than showing any symptoms.  </p><p>I wanted to get it for all my staff, but the Congress denied me that, so I got it for all my campaign. So they--the way to say hey, if your respiratory rate moves two points, don't come into work that day. Stay home. And it's a way that we can stay safer together. We are wearing masks and others, but how can we have any early indication of it? And this is one of the wearables that you can do. PGA is actually-- </p><p>ALLEN: As we think about-- </p><p>MCCARTHY: --Yeah.   </p><p>ALLEN: As we think about the way that the pandemic has changed our life, you have an opinion piece in the Financial Times talking about some of the real risk that the pandemic has exposed in America, a danger of this over dependence on foreign supply. There are some things the government can do, tax incentives. What do you think business should do to help close that gap?  </p><p>MCCARTHY: Well you know when I was in business school getting my MBA, we'd always study Malcolm Baldwin, Just in Time, right? You want more efficiency and everything. But now we have to rethink that. How dependent have we become on China? And with China lying to the world and hoarding the PPE, what about the critical minerals like we don't make penicillin, we don't make vitamins anymore. What about a national stockpile? I think we should rethink a stockpile.  </p><p>In the past, we would buy product and store hit in some government facility thinking you're going to send it out. By the time you ever need it. It's expired, it's been there 20 years. Let's think differently. What if we go to business? And let's take an example. Say 3M makes a million masks a year. Why don't we pay them to make 1.2 million masks, they store it and then the next year they result those masks and they put new fresh ones in?  </p><p>So there's--in the world today, they can ship anything within 24 hours, so give the businesses an incentive to have it. And if you're already in China producing items, don't move to Vietnam. You should move to North America.  </p><p>The one thing I've learned from this pandemic and what we're going through, you can still track things backwards--back and forth. And there are critical minerals and critical items that it's too important to sit back. And I'm a free marketer, but I don't want to be dependent on anybody else, especially when it comes to America.  </p><p>So there are things we need to rethink to make sure we still have control here. And we are doing that when it comes to the vaccine and therapeutics, but you have to be able to make them in America and get those essential items here. Never again should we be dependent on some other country and those critical items that we need for our own health and security. </p><p>ALLEN: And one of the big factors that you point to in this overdependence is China and we've seen what China has done in Hong Kong. How worried are you about what China is going to be doing with Taiwan?  </p><p>MCCARTHY: I'm very scared about this. It's not something because of COVID. Remember, 30 years ago you watched a million kids go to Tiananmen Square. They build the goddess of democracy that looked like the Statue of Liberty across from the portrait of Mao and you watched what China did rolling the tanks. You watched that young man stand in front of the tank that was willing--we knew he was going to lose his life. We don't know who he is today because we know he's not alive but he was willing to give that up for the idea of freedom.  </p><p>And when you think of America, we are more than a country, we are in idea. An idea that inspires people 30 years ago at Tiananmen Square, inspire people for millions in the last year in Hong Kong that would come out for crave the idea of freedom of speech or the shipyard workers in Poland more than 30 years ago or the individuals that tore down a wall that divided two Germanys. We are watching China use a crisis in the world that they created to expand their own beliefs.  </p><p>We watched what they do in the South China Sea, we're watching what they're doing now with shooting missiles, we watch as they build islands, say they weren't going to weaponize them and they do. We watch what they had stolen from us in the past, the IP. Now watching the FBI tell us that they wanted to influence our election to actually elect Joe Biden.  </p><p>So I think China should be a critical element of what this election is about, but I went a year ago to the speaker to ask that could we get a bipartisan committee together, same number of Republicans, same number of Democrats not just looking at IP theft, but could we have one American strategy for what we're doing for the next 100 years? Because China does.  </p><p>You know, in China, if you want to fly somewhere, you may have the money, but they won't sell it to you simply because it's what you have said or family members have. They give you a social score and they're going to put that on everybody. The if the NBA won't stand up to them, what's going to happen in the future? So I think the one perspective--we need one plan as Americans on what we're going to do with China. And I think all the allies would join us based upon COVID.  </p><p>ALLEN: I mentioned at the top that you have close relations with the Silicon Valley. An issue that you were early on you were concerned about censorship of conservatives. How do you think that the big tech companies are doing in trying to assuage the fears in Washington? Washington definitely has the Valley in its sights. What's the advice you're giving those companies? </p><p>MCCARTHY: They're doing worse than they were before. They were letting politics run yet instead of the fairness of the business. They now have Democrats and Republicans very concerned. Their power is only getting larger. And in the world of COVID, it's getting larger because they have more influence.  </p><p>But I don't think they were forthcoming in a lot. I have real concerns of what Google has been doing and I think you're going to hit a point--I've warned them time and again, you're going to hit a point where people are going to say you're a monopoly. If 90 percent of every search on the Internet goes through Google and you can control what people see and what people say and you want to influence an election, I don't think you're going to be able to maintain. If you're on the second page of Google and 90 percent of it drops off, that you've got a real problem.  </p><p>If you're directing was it driving to sites and others, you're going to have a problem and people are going to think they're going to have to level the playing field. And I see a concern on both sides of the aisle. So I think they need to rethink what they're doing right now.  </p><p>ALLEN: So it sounds like you strongly think that there is regulatory legal, legislative action coming big tech's way. </p><p>MCCARTHY: Yeah, and there's two different ways to handle this, which I disagree with what the Democrats want to do. They want to regulate it like it's that utility and then we get no innovation, nothing else. I want to have a competitive playing field, right? I mean, when you look at what Amazon is able to do--you know who should have been Amazon? Sears. They had the catalog, they sold you everything, but they failed. But competition proved something better.  </p><p>What I see now from this big tech is there not allowing competition to come up. We see that time and again from their practices. That's where government really should come in because technology improves every single day. I mean, before Google, there was Yahoo and other search engines, right? And government came in and actually allowed Google to move up but now Google goes out and kind of quashes many times that we found any new small company from rising up. That's the place that we should really look at and to make sure there is a level playing field, there's competition that somebody is not controlling the market but utilizing it too control what people see and what people think. </p><p>ALLEN: And so just to put a bow on this, you're saying that Washington is more concerned about the tech companies than they were a year ago? </p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, yeah. Tech companies control more every single day. Think about it. From Instagram, from Google, from a search, from YouTube, from Facebook, those sound like four big companies. No, those are only two companies but they're controlling so much of our life and so much of what we see and know.  </p><p>And in a world of COVID, you're relying on technology more because you're not going out. That's concerning to me and everybody else. And in the influence of what they're trying to do to make people on what you say, their determining now what free speech is. I haven't seen them ban China on what China does, but they want to ban what Americans think or say in a--in a free speech world. I think they're overstepping their bounds. I watched that time and again with Twitter.  </p><p>ALLEN: All right, Mr. Leader, as we say goodbye, I'm going to ask you a question about human nature and I'm going to give you an example. So my nephew Morgan works at a coffee bar and he says that when you put a coffee in someone's hand, they don't even have to drink it, they're suddenly friendlier. They're nicer. It's purely psychological. At age 21, you started your first business. Kevin O's Deli. Tell me something you learned about human nature there that serves you as you campaign for House candidates, House members this fall. </p><p>MCCARTHY: It will be very interesting. You know, I won--I won the lottery, I invested, I took that money and opened a deli. I took a risk, right? Well, there are three lessons I learned. You're the first to work, last to leave, last to be paid.  </p><p>You're going to listen more because it's the customer. You're going to find ways to constantly improve every single day. But in the business of service, you connect with somebody, right? They trust you because they are providing their hard work money to purchase something from you. They want to make sure the quality is at that higher level. They want to make sure you surpass expectations and you want to be able to take them almost to a different place, have them try something in a sandwich.  </p><p>Some of my sandwiches are still around in other delis in Bakersfield today. They call it the McCarthy. It was Turkey, cream cheese, and artichoke hearts. Something that I never had ever made before and it wasn't something that I knew would be good, I just wanted it to try something new and expand somebody's taste. But they asked for something. I showed up on time, I made the quality better, and I made a connection with them that they knew my name. I put my name on the business, Kevin O's, so if they had a complaint, they knew who to come to.  </p><p>That bill, that trust, the respect that you have for one another has never left me. And the most important part, you're willing to serve somebody. I still go back today and I work behind the counter and other businesses because I think the ability to serve somebody, regardless of their wealth, regardless of the color of skin or gender says something about the character of who you are. </p><p>ALLEN: Mr. Leader, Mr. Chairman, we look forward to your speech tonight and thank you for joining Axios. </p><p>MCCARTHY: All right. It's over. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>ALLEN: Touche. We are adjourned. Thank all of you for joining the series. Thank Microsoft for these conversations about the future of employability. We appreciate your joining us in the two part series and huge shout out to the Axios events team. Incredible two weeks back to back of conventions programming that they pulled off. Most grateful to them. So thank--Microsoft, thank you all and look forward to seeing you on Axios.com. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PM-BTC1-F15W-H19X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Heads-up:  Every quarter Axios journalists highlight the trends they are watching in politics, energy, science, technology, business and more. As a subscriber to this newsletter, you'll see that in your inbox from Mike Allen tomorrow. The topic: \"A brewing storm for big tech.\"   Today's word count is a mere 712 words, or &lt;3 minutes.   What the White House billed yesterday as a high-profile counterpunch to \"Medicare for All\" turned out to be much less significant \u2014 a fairly normal, fairly vague policy statement with no real implications for 2020.   Between the lines: Trump is promoting Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that does matter for the program and the federal budget.  But it's not a new position, and not one that has much to do with the broader debate over the American health care system.  What they're saying: \"Proposals like 'Medicare for All,' as well as the public options, are not just impractical, they are morally wrong because they would demote American seniors to little better than second-class status,\" Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma told reporters yesterday.   Reality check: Plenty of what the Trump administration has said is hyperbole, untrue or unknowable. And the policy the administration rolled out has little to do with these big-picture issues.  \"I think this is the shapings of a political argument for why 'Medicare for All' is bad, not an alternative to 'Medicare for All,'\" said a health insurance executive familiar with GOP politics.  Details: Yesterday's executive order requires regulatory changes advantageous to Medicare Advantage, which is run by private insurers.  \"This is not any radical change by the administration, just a continuation of their push to increase flexibilities in MA and increase the supplemental benefits offerings for beneficiaries,\" said Avalere's Chris Sloan.  Go deeper:   The hospital industry isn't just consolidating among . Deals are happening frequently at the local level, too, Axios' Bob Herman reports.   Why it matters: Smaller hospital deals are just as important as large system mergers because local market power is paramount in health care \u2014 people usually get care close to where they live.  A combined entity reduces competition, which could give it the upper hand in negotiations with commercial health insurers in its area.  The big picture: The number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in the first half of this year tracked in line with 2018 and featured  with , according to an analysis from . Plenty of smaller transactions are rolling out now, too.   Between the lines: Hospitals contend their deals are about improving patient care. But their press releases and executives rarely, if ever, talk about the financial benefits of their new enhanced negotiating power.  If hospitals in smaller communities combine, commercial insurers will have a harder time excluding any one of them from their networks, even if a hospital has poorer quality or higher prices. This is commonly called \"all-or-none\" contracting, and it's been cited in the .  State and federal antitrust officials also have  to investigate these kinds of regional deals, making it easier for those with antitrust issues to go forward.   Bob has more .   Go deeper:   It's illegal for U.S. airlines to take off without a kit of lifesaving drugs on board, but the Federal Aviation Administration has been handing out exemptions because some of those drugs are facing shortages, the  reports.   Domestic and international flights must carry drugs for severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrest, irregular heart rhythm, slow heart rates and low blood sugar, Axios' Marisa Fernandez writes.  In 2016 more than 50 airlines  from the requirement to carry all 5 drugs in the medical kit, per NYT. Narrower exemptions are more common.  Health officials are especially concerned about epinephrine or adrenaline, which can be life savers for the tens of millions of people with food allergies.   Yes, but: Fainting, near-fainting and gastrointestinal problems are more common in flight than other emergencies, the Times reports.   New York says it has reached a \"milestone\" in halting the measles outbreak that started in October 2018, and U.S. public health officials now believe the U.S. has retained its measles elimination status \u2014 just barely meeting the year deadline, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.   Yes, but: Recent cases reported from returning international travelers demonstrate the danger of new outbreaks when there are still pockets of communities with low vaccination rates, Axios' Eileen Drage O'Reilly .  Despite measles being mostly preventable, the combination of the  and  places several communities at risk.  Related: \" Thousands of individual schools in the U.S. don't have high enough immunization levels to meet the threshold considered adequate to protect a population from measles,\" the Wall Street Journal .   Wonder what it must be like to be the ER doctor who's in charge of making sure Bernie Sanders' heart is healthy (or being in charge of any presidential candidate's health, for that matter)?   Some actual ER docs have wondered the same thing, Axios' Sam Baker writes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-40346604880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6B-6WV1-F07F-83JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Axios.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>WI Co Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>073570</className><className>KRX</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KR7073570004</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The company expansion will look to make the most of the local engineering talent.</p><p>Welcoming the announcement Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD said \"Axway's decision to expand its R&amp;D Centre of Excellence and create 15 high quality jobs is a clear indication of Ireland's importance as a key location for technology companies to expand and grow their business. Under our Action Plan for Jobs we have identified the technology sector as an area of great potential and I am committed to ensuring that we continue to attract further investments and create much needed jobs for this economy\".</p><p>\"There is a world class software engineering population in Ireland and we want to recruit from this talent pool. Dublin in particular is globally acknowledged as a hub of engineering excellence and we will be looking to recruit senior engineering staff for our R&amp;D Centre,\" said Laurent Bride, Executive Vice President of Research &amp; Development, Axway.\" Engineers joining us will be working on some of the latest computing technologies as we evolve Axway's enterprise software portfolio, to ensure we are at the forefront of the Cloud and Mobile innovation curve\".</p><p>Barry O'Leary, CEO, IDA Ireland said \"Axway is a leading global provider of Software business solutions.

Mike Capuano has conceded defeat to Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley in the Massachusetts primary for his U.S. House seat Tuesday, the latest upset to rock the Democratic Party and showcase a restive base eager for change. In his concession speech, Capuano said the district was clearly upset with the status quo and that he shared those feelings. Tales of the Trump White House in chaos are nothing new, but never have the stories come with the credibility that journalist Bob Woodward, of Watergate fame, gives them in his new book \"Fear.\" Woodward says he has documents and recorded conversations to back up the stunning claims. Brett Kavanaugh didn't say a lot on the first day of his confirmation hearings. But then again, how could he, with protesters constantly interrupting the proceedings (there were 70 arrests) and Democratic senators staging an aggressive, sustained attack to slow the march to his inevitable confirmation. Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall late Tuesday night west of the Alabama-Mississippi border, the National Hurricane Center said. A child was killed Tuesday in Pensacola when a tree fell on top of a mobile home. Big Tech executives are coming to Capitol Hill today to testify about election meddling. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss actions their companies have taken to thwart foreign influence campaigns targeting the 2018 midterm elections.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:30:00] MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This August, just a few weeks ago, he was up by 13 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She brought people out that don't typically vote.

The president suggesting, baselessly in one tweet, the award-winning veteran journalist is a Democratic operative because the book, released two months before the midterms, betrays chaos inside the White House.</p><p>CNN's Jamie Gangel has more on Woodward's meticulously reported book.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Dave and Christine, this explosive new book from legendary journalist Bob Woodward goes inside the Trump White House with Woodward detailing extraordinary measures that senior aides have taken to circumvent the president to, in effect, step in and stop what they saw as President Trump's most -- and this is quote -- \"dangerous impulses\" including stealing and hiding documents right off his Oval Office desk.</p><p>There are also some stunning revelations about the Russia investigation. Woodward recounts a dramatic session the White House in which Trump's then-personal attorney John Dowd puts the president through a mock interview to see if he is capable of testifying to special counsel Robert Mueller without perjuring himself. Woodward reports that Trump fails the test.</p><p>And what's even more remarkable is that Dowd and Trump's current attorney Jay Sekulow then go and reenact the scene to Robert Mueller himself in an attempt to convince Mueller that Trump is incapable of getting through an interview.</p><p>According to Woodward, Mueller isn't convinced and responds, quote, \"I need the president's testimony.\" And then, Mueller says, \"I want to know what was his intent on Comey. I want to see if there was corrupt intent.\"</p><p>Dave, Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: All right, Jamie. Thank you.</p><p>Some of the most startling quotes in Woodward's book come from two of the president's top aides.</p><p>Chief of staff John Kelly reported in the book to have called President Trump an idiot, erratic and unhinged. Woodward reports an irate Kelly ranted at a staff meeting \"We're in Crazytown. This is the worst job I've ever had.\"</p><p>The book portrays Defense Sec. James Mattis as exasperated and alarmed by the president. Mattis quoted as saying, \"Trump has the understanding of a fifth or sixth-grader.\"</p><p>Both men among the chorus of administration officials pushing back. Chief of staff Kelly saying he and the president have, quote, \"an incredibly candid and strong relationship\" and calls the story, quote \"total B.S.\"</p><p>Mattis denying he uttered the contemptuous words attributed to him, describing Woodward's book as fiction. BRIGGS: One important player not appearing in the book is President Trump, himself, and that's why Bob Woodward decided to release audio recordings to prove he made an effort to interview the president and get his side of the story.</p><p>Listen now to the conversation between Woodward and Mr. Trump when they connected by phone three weeks ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB WOODWARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST, AUTHOR, \"FEAR: TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE\": And, as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Right.</p><p>WOODWARD: And I would have liked to have done that and I maximized my effort --</p><p>TRUMP: Right.</p><p>WOODWARD: -- and somehow it didn't get to you or --</p><p>TRUMP: It's really too bad because nobody told me about it and I would have loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Trump did later acknowledge Lindsey Graham told him in a private meeting that Woodward wanted an interview.</p><p>[05:35:04] Also note, the president concedes on tape there that Woodward has always been fair. Overnight, Mr. Trump suggested the legendary journalist included lies and phony sources in his book. Woodward says he stands by his reporting.</p><p>His first interview is Sunday morning.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's bring in \"CNN POLITICS\" digital editor Zach Wolf live in Washington.</p><p>Zach, Bob Woodward --</p><p>ZACHARY WOLF, DIGITAL DIRECTOR, CNN POLITICS: Good morning.</p><p>ROMANS: -- is meticulous, he is well-sourced. He is trusted by insiders in Washington and he paints this sort of picture of people around the president who are trying to protect the democracy from the president himself.</p><p>Is this a game changer, though, for this administration and this president?</p><p>WOLF: You know, I think you hear Trump come out and say it's totally fabricated. It's getting -- it's not like this book is an outlier. It's not like it sounds so much different than \"Fire and Fury\" did -- than any of the magazine accounts or the other accounts of former staffers who have -- who have come out.</p><p>The quotes in the book are incredible. The access that Bob Woodward had is incredible but it doesn't sound so much different. So it's getting very hard to not believe that this is sort of the state of things in the White House.</p><p>I'm not sure that that makes it a game changer because the president's supporters are so engrained with him, but it certainly just another tick that this is, in fact, what's going on there.</p><p>(Audio Gap)</p><p>BRIGGS: -- campaign and the \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" (audio gap). You could talk about Charlottesville, you could talk about Stormy Daniels and how many times people said is this a game changer.</p><p>ROMANS: And it wasn't.</p><p>BRIGGS: Call me skeptical. The truest thing he ever said was if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue he would not lose supporters. I'm not sure this changes the narrative or the game at all.</p><p>But what is a game changer, politically speaking, is what's happening in the Democratic Party last night -- a huge upset in Massachusetts. Ayanna Pressley coming from I guess the far-left to knock off the incumbent, a very popular Congressman Capuano.</p><p>Look, Tip O'Neill famously said all politics is local and demographics played a huge role there in that district.</p><p>What is happening nationally, though?</p><p>WOLF: I think that the -- it's clear that the party wants to be a younger party that looks a little bit more like the people it represents. This is a majority-minority district, meaning most of the people in this district aren't white. They have an older white man representing them and his policies seemed very close in line with his challenger Ayanna Pressley here.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: And she even kind of copped to that but -- that, you know, change, they were saying, needs to come and that the district needs to be represented by the people who are there. And you saw the same thing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York where they said that the district needs to look a little bit more like me. And a lot of that's happening, particularly for Democrats.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, then you look at Florida -- the governor race. You have a progressive mayor of Tallahassee there who's closing in really on the Republican for this -- the Republican who has tied his -- has tied his -- his, you know --</p><p>BRIGGS: To Trump. He is all Trump in this race. ROMANS: Absolutely, and look at that. Andrew Gillum, 50 percent to 47 percent. So very obviously, very close within three points.</p><p>But what's happening in that race?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, it's very close, it's very early. I think it will be interesting to see if that can sustain.</p><p>There are some ethics questions about Gillum that DeSantis, the Republican, is really trying to flog out there. I don't know if anything will come from that. And that there's also I think a very overt racial element to that race that writ large in the state of Florida.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: I'm not sure how that will play out --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: -- but that's certainly coloring that race in a -- in a way that the others have not been.</p><p>BRIGGS: Right, and if the polls are accurate in the first place, Gillum wouldn't even be the Democratic nominee.</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: They didn't give him much of a chance --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- to begin with.</p><p>Let's move to day two for Brett Kavanaugh -- the Supreme Court confirmation hearings. And day one was an absolute yes. As they call it here in the \"New York Post\" -- a \"Full Court Mess.\"</p><p>Here's what Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said about the proceedings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R-NE), MEMBER, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Judge Kavanaugh doesn't lust after dirty water and stinky air. No, looking at his record, it seems to me that what he actually dislikes are legislators that are too lazy and risk-averse to do our actual jobs.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: We saw the resistance on full display from the protesters breaking in to the request to adjourn before this thing even began over document requests.</p><p>Did the resistance lay a glove on Brett Kavanaugh or was it effective?</p><p>WOLF: Well, I mean, let's point out -- and I think you've said this already today -- that only in the U.S. Senate can you set aside an entire day and only get through opening statements.</p><p>ROMANS: I know.</p><p>WOLF: I mean, part of that is because of the delay from Democrats. I'm not sure that people will, in the annals of all of this, remember day one of this hearing.</p><p>There is some interesting video there and there was him refusing to shake hands with the Parkland victim's father. But ultimately, this hearing is going to come down to the coming days when we actually hear what he has to say about some things.</p><p>[05:40:04] ROMANS: All right, Zach Wolf. Nice to see you this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>Forty minutes past the hour.</p><p>BRIGGS: Thanks, Zach.</p><p>ROMANS: And, Tropical Storm Gordon making landfall late last night west of the Alabama-Mississippi border. It has -- it has already turned deadly. A child killed in Pensacola, Florida when a tree fell on top of a mobile home.</p><p>Strong winds from that storm also knocking out power in the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama leaving thousands in the dark.</p><p>Let's bring in our meteorologist Jennifer Gray. She joins us now from Gulfport, Mississippi. She's got the latest. Hi, Jennifer.</p><p>JENNIFER GRAY, AMS METEROLOGIST: Hi, Christine.</p><p>Yes, the worst of the storm definitely happened in places in southern Alabama as well as the Florida Panhandle.</p><p>The storm is now north of Hattiesburg, still carrying about 40-mile- an-hour winds, hanging on as a tropical storm. It will continue its route to the north and continue to weaken as it does so.</p><p>There's still a lot of rain though left with this across portions of Alabama as well as the Florida Panhandle where we had some flood advisories there. Two to four inches an hour possible, so still a little bit of a concern for flooding as this storm travels to the north. Also a concern will be brief tornados as this storm continues to push to the north.</p><p>Across Gulfport, things will be quickly getting back to normal today. Most of the activity happened to our east.</p><p>As far as the power outages go there are about 30,000 people without power across portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. Most of those being around the Mobile area so crews will be working to try to get their power restored -- Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, another busy day ahead for you. Thank you so much for that. Jennifer Grey for us in Gulfport. BRIGGS: All right.</p><p>Ahead, two titans of Silicon Valley head back to Capitol Hill for another grilling. A live breakdown just ahead on EARLY START.</p><p>[05:46:03] ROMANS: All right.</p><p>Executives from Facebook and Twitter head to Capitol Hill today. They'll defend their efforts to thwart foreign influence campaigns targeting the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>And, Twitter's CEO will likely push back on accusations of political bias against the right. Google executives are expected to be a no- show.</p><p>CNN's Samuel Burke joins us live from London.</p><p>And Samuel, it's so interesting. Yesterday we heard from Alex Stamos, the former Facebook chief security officer, and he said Congress has kind of been asleep at the switch here on these concerns about meddling in the election. I mean, really mired in their own political problems -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX STAMOS, FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, FACEBOOK: Considering how much things blew up later in the year, there was a lot less interest from Congress than I would have expected.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Really?</p><p>STAMOS: Yes, so most of the Republicans were not interested in revisiting what happening in 2016. And because we were not directly talking about activity by the Trump campaign it was of less interest --</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>STAMOS: -- to the Democratic side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Other than that, everything's great.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN MONEY, LONDON: Alex Stamos has also said that it's too late to safeguard our elections --</p><p>ROMANS: This year.</p><p>BURKE: -- the midterm elections --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: -- this year. He said, too late -- maybe 2020. But in terms of social media, well it's much too late to effectively rehabilitate the elections.</p><p>You see what he is saying right there -- election security for the 2018 midterms. \"There are straightforward steps the U.S. can take to prepare for potential attacks in 2020.\"</p><p>He says we need laws. The big problem here is that Congress has not laid out what all social media companies need to do, not just Facebook and Twitter, the big ones. There are also so many small ones.</p><p>I think there are two big things we're going to see today. One, foreign interference -- there are going to be discussions about that. And number two, is -- are these political platforms biased -- these algorithms biased in some way.</p><p>Here's what we're expecting the executives to say. You'll hear Sheryl Sandberg saying things along the lines of we took too long to spot the problems. We took too long to react to the problems.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: Jack Dorsey is going to say we've done studies, we don't see any biases.</p><p>And what for me is very interesting, don't expect the stock prices to move. The investors have seen these executives --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: -- be grilled before and they know that Congress doesn't understand technology that well and therefore, is unlikely to create many regulations that could affect these companies.</p><p>ROMANS: It's funny those companies lobbied for a really long time though not to be regulated also by --</p><p>BRIGGS: Well --</p><p>ROMANS: Washington doesn't understand how it works. So now they say oh, we need laws. We need -- we need laws to give us the rules of the road after for 20 years saying we don't laws.</p><p>BRIGGS: This will turn into partisan bickering just like every other Senate hearing we've seen over the last couple of years.</p><p>Jack Dorsey will also talk about the need for transparency.</p><p>But, Mark Zuckerberg preempted Sheryl Sandberg's visit in \"The Washington Post\" writing, \"We've made a lot of progress but companies such as Facebook face sophisticated, well-funded adversaries who are getting better (sic) over time.\"</p><p>But he ends with the key part here. \"It will take the combined forces of the private and public sectors to protest America's democracy.\"</p><p>Are we seeing a combined effort? Will we in the future?</p><p>BURKE: I think we are seeing a combined effort in the sense that we know that on the private side these companies have created more artificial intelligence.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: They've invested in more human moderators. Imagine that -- human beings looking at content and then flagging it.</p><p>But they are also working closely with private investigators -- these cybersecurity firms -- and law enforcement. But what we hear from folks like Alex Stamos, the former Facebook security executive, that there's just not enough investment on the government side.</p><p>They've been looking at things like the grid. We've gone on for years about the grid. Meanwhile, we've had this foreign interference in our elections on social media so our eyes were on the wrong ball.</p><p>I've just got to say don't underestimate Jack Dorsey. He's been on this media tour so he's had a lot --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: -- of practice on CNN.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg used to be the chief of staff for Lawrence Summers during the Clinton years, so she's got a lot of political experience.</p><p>[05:50:04] They're going to be very steady --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: -- in all estimations.</p><p>ROMANS: She does have a lot of Washington experience and she'll know how to talk to those -- to those lawmakers.</p><p>I think what's really important to underscore here is that the adversaries are diverse. They are well-funded as Mark Zuckerberg said. But also, they're working real hard right now to undermine the midterms and the general presumably in 2020.</p><p>BURKE: And to your point Christine, for two years we've been basically talking about Russia. And now, just a few weeks ago --</p><p>ROMANS: Iran.</p><p>BURKE: -- it looks like the influence campaign is coming from Iran. The threat --</p><p>BRIGGS: Right.</p><p>BURKE: -- is changing so fast. And so many countries have seen what Russia has been able to do so effectively and now they're wanting do to it not just against Americans but even for their own people. We're getting more and more documentation coming out about how governments are using these tools to manipulate and track their own citizens.</p><p>ROMANS: It's so depressing how well they have been able to push -- you know, just drive these wedges on race, on religion, on culture in America and just exploit that so well.</p><p>BRIGGS: Side bet on which senator interviews the empty chair for Google's presence that's not there. That will happen. It's about theatrics on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Thank you, Samuel Burke -- appreciate it.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you, Samuel.</p><p>BURKE: How a good day.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK.</p><p>North Carolina's unconstitutionally gerrymandered map will be used in the upcoming midterm elections. A federal court ruling there is insufficient time to redraw it before November and imposing a new schedule for the elections would likely confuse voters and depress turnout.</p><p>Republicans hold 10 of North Carolina's 13 seats in the House. A redrawn map could affect the overall balance of power in the House. The current North Carolina map will not be used again after November sixth.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>Famous filmmaker Tyler Perry stepping up to try to solve a 15-year-old mystery.</p><p>BRIGGS: And the mystery surrounding the most famous slippers in movie history is now solved.</p><p>[05:56:37] BRIGGS: Filmmaker Tyler Perry, along with civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, announcing a civil suit against a former sheriff's deputy they believe may be responsible for the disappearance of two men some 15 years ago.</p><p>Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos went missing in Naples, Florida -- one in 2003 and the other in 2004. Both were last seen with then- Deputy Steve Calkins who arrested them. He was later fired for giving conflicting statements to investigators but no charges were ever filed.</p><p>Tyler Perry doubling the reward he was offering at $200,000 for information leading to a conviction in the disappearance of the two men.</p><p>ROMANS: It wasn't the wizard but an FBI sting operation that recovered the most famous slippers in movie history 13 years after they were stolen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDY GARLAND, ACTRESS, \"THE WIZARD OF OZ\": Tap your heels together three times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: There's no place like home.</p><p>The ruby slippers that Dorothy wore in \"The Wizard of Oz\" were taken in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota. The purloined pumps, size 5 1/2, are one of four known pairs that Garland wore in that classic film. It is estimated they're worth more than $2 million.</p><p>Authorities are still looking for whoever stole the slippers. The slippers were returned --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- but the mystery remains.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. \"Oz\" turns 80 next summer.</p><p>ROMANS: Really?</p><p>BRIGGS: Finally, Fallon, Meyers, and Colbert not holding back on the president as portrayed in Bob Woodward's new book. Here are your late-night laughs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, NBC HOST, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\": In his upcoming book about the White House, reporter Bob Woodward says that President Trump regrets criticizing white supremacists and calls it the biggest f***ing mistake he's made.</p><p>Then Trump looked at Don, Jr. and said actually second biggest mistake. I'm sorry, Donnie. Come back, Donnie.</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, CBS HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": He is reportedly scolding his generals about Afghanistan, saying you should be killing guys. You don't need a strategy to kill people.</p><p>Yes, and who needs a strategy in war? We all remember what Eisenhower said at D-Day. \"Helter Skelter, little piggies.\"</p><p>SETH MEYERS, CBS HOST, \"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS\": Woodward's book also claims that when President Trump learned of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment he said, quote, \"Everybody's trying to get me. Well, not everybody.\" ROMANS: All right. While you were sleeping they had a field day with the Woodward book -- the comedians did.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, they're back from their break and they've got --</p><p>ROMANS: They are.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- plenty of material.</p><p>ROMANS: They are.</p><p>Thanks for joining us. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. \"NEW DAY\" starts right now. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESSLEY: It seems like change is on the way.</p><p>MARQUEZ: The blue wave took out a very blue member of Congress for a bluer one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Women and minorities are coming out in huge numbers this primary season.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People in the White House recognize the risk of this president in trying to protect his country.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: If he's got a problem with Sessions, just fire him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This book is not so much fake news as it's old news.

That case, if accepted, will be heard in Europe in 2017.</p><p>Parallel to this is a second case involving the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who wants a ruling on the validity of the special contractual clauses many companies have relied upon as an alternative to Safe Harbour or Privacy Shield. </p><p>These contracts and agreements are dependent on the US - and soon, post-Brexit UK - showing that EU data is given adequate protection. </p><p>Yet, the incoming Trump administration shows every sign of supporting increased secret surveillance. If so, the US will find it difficult to maintain that Privacy Shield is fit for purpose.</p><p>The UK has just passed the draconian Investigatory Powers (IP) Act, which in effect gives lawful permission for the secretive, wide-scale surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden - and the European Court of Justice just ruled unlawful the sweeping surveillance powers allowed in what has become the IP Act. </p><p>The looming question for 2017: can the US and the UK believably provide mandatory EU data transfer protections? If not, what happens to trade reliant on digital data transfers?</p><p>Make no mistake, this is a tier one business issue of resounding - unthinkable - potential impact. Data transfers quite conceivably could be halted, a scenario mostly ignored by the business world (large to small), legal advisers and politicians, all alarmingly under-informed on privacy and data-protection policy and politics.</p><h>Gig economics </h><p>Next: the \"gig economy\" and its millions of not-really-employees, who work under the aegis of \"disrupter\" companies that have been gorging on VC funding, such as Uber and Airbnb.  </p><p>The companies argue that they fall outside of the regulation placed on the (oddly similar) industries they disrupt.</p><p>Now, though, life for the disrupters is being disrupted. Many are facing a rake of lawsuits from unhappy consumers, officialdom and \"employees\" (who argue they are actually employees). </p><p>New regulations and requirements have been imposed in some locations. Some firms are losing money - Uber, valued at $69 billion, is said to be nursing an $800 million loss in the third quarter and could end 2016 a couple of billion in the red.</p><p>Will these disrupters simply be companies that exist in a short window when they take advantage of under-regulated industries before collapsing or turning into more traditional companies? Will they make or lose money for investors? The coming year will be interesting.</p><h>Algorithm adoration </h><p>Third on my list: the adoration of the algorithms. Until 2016, many people admired, or at most ignored, those adept, money-making computer algorithms developed by companies such as Google and Facebook, which shape our searches and determine what we see online.  </p><p>However, after Brexit and the US presidential election and the emergence - for some demographics, dominance - of fake or highly filtered news, algorithms are under fire.</p><p>Companies such as Google shamefully missed the depth to which their algorithms were being gamed and exploited for a worryingly long time - even to where the predominant returns on searches on the Holocaust on Google were sites stating the Holocaust was a hoax.</p><p>Some, including politicians, are now arguing that these ultra-secret algorithms, with their little understood calculations that silently dominate public discourse and private life to the point where elections could possibly be influenced, must be more transparent.</p><p>And a final jumble of issues I think will keep growing in 2017: first, multinational taxes. The EU to the left of them, bombastic Trump threats to the right - what's a big tech company to do? </p><p>Under threat of losing those ingenious tax breaks, they'll have to wait and see whether Trump actually does more than mouth off and whether the EU can force payments.</p><p>Second: what constitutes a media company in these internet-dominated days? This matters in terms of regulation, royalties, income and content production. </p><p>Right now, Google and Facebook eat up most online revenue for news actually produced by \"real\" media organisations. </p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has just conceded that Facebook is a sort of media company, if not a traditional one (see \"gig economy\", \"algorithms\" and \"data transfer\"). </p><p>For a long time, we have been told (as with Google) that the companies merely provide a technology \"platform\". The implications of being a media company eventually could be significant.</p><p>I've got one more that emerged over Christmas - but I am saving that for a full column next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.2919873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MH3-R231-JC8Y-83W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 29, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION COURTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922110EM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp;

The big picture: There were enormous business challenges, which resulted in an unprecedented number of layoffs, desperate product maneuvers and fire-sale deals. Driving the news: The impeachment of President Trump by the House of Representatives on Thursday was prompted by a whistleblower's complaint, but the stage was set by the dogged reporting of many journalists across the country. But despite those efforts, the economic outlook of the news industry is still grim heading into 2020. The impeachment process has proven that voters are starting to tune out[1] political coverage, which for the past few years has been the news industry's biggest money-maker. </p><p>That reality, coupled with an anticipated recession, has newsrooms on edge. Where things stand: 2019 was a particularly brutal[2] year for older news industries, like newspapers, magazines, television and radio. Revenue for television was down nearly 4% this year, and for print it was down nearly 20%. Legacy magazine brands that were once considered must-reads, like Sports Illustrated, struggled to find suitors. Magazine titans like Conde Nast are expected to miss[3] their revenue numbers given a bleak advertising forecast. Univision, one of the largest media companies that serves America's fastest-growing population, is looking[4] for a buyer to help it crawl out of a massive debt[5] hole, driven by a private equity investment gone bad[6]. Be smart: Legacy industries still continue to serve local news markets, which are mostly void of the same investments financially, and in tech and talent, as national outlets. The two biggest local newspaper holding groups \u2014 New Media (GateHouse and Gannett) and McClatchy, which collectively house over 700 newspapers \u2014 had a combined market cap value as of Thursday of less than $800 million. By comparison, Apple, which this year launched its own news product, is worth more than $1.2 trillion.Meanwhile, several other papers serving major markets closed, like the 150-year-old Vindicator[7] in Youngstown, Ohio and the beloved OC Weekly[8] in California. Regulators, aware of the realities that legacy industries and local media face in a digital world, continued efforts to level the playing field this year, mostly by trying to roll back decades-old rules[9] that may be keeping them from growing. But their efforts have proven mostly moot, as most consumers have already migrated away from those mediums to a handful of apps[10] owned by Silicon Valley titans. Policymakers did begin to more meaningfully consider[11] regulating internet giants in 2019, but a gridlocked Congress and powerful lobbying forces[12] have so far prevented any meaningful internet regulation from getting passed. In the markets, a string of highly-anticipated IPOs faltered[13] in 2019, which forced investors in private media companies to push for quicker paths to profit. Given that news is traditionally a slow-growth business, many desperate efforts to make money quickly, like launching half-baked subscription or video products, fell short.For some media upstarts, that pressure proved perilous. Splinter, the left-leaning news and opinion site, shut down[14] this year after its parent company, G/O Media, was purchased by a private equity company for less than half[15] of what it was worth just three years earlier.Its sister company, Deadspin, is now essentially defunct[16]. The big picture: As a result of these realities, investor sentiment in digital media has begun to slip, and investments in the sector are predicted to decline[17] in the next decade. That matters because over the past few years, private investment into media companies soared, at all levels. Many of the venture-backed media companies that were expected to go public eventually, like Buzzfeed and Vice Media, no longer seem heading in that direction. Disney this year wrote down[18] all of the $400 million it invested in Vice. Between the lines: These challenges took a human toll[19] on journalists and news industry employees around the country. By some estimates[20], nearly 8,000 people were laid off or lost their jobs in media in 2019. That level of attrition[21] is on pace to be the highest it's been since the 2009 recession. Yes, but: The challenges that most media companies face have forced them to innovate faster, and in many cases, reach new heights. Most media companies distribute content to far more people than ever before through dozens of new channels ranging from Netflix[22] to TikTok[23]. Many broke stories this year that will define our generation, like The Washington Post's investigation[24] into the decades-long lies told by officials about the war in Afghanistan or The Miami Herald's explosive reporting[25] about Jeffrey Epstein. The bottom line: But despite those feats, news media companies as a whole have mostly suffered \u2014 and there's no sign that the economic outlook is going to get better any time soon.

The sheer excess of unmoderated, uncurated media, among other reasons, has put YouTube at the center of ongoing debates about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/03/08/alt-right-vs-youtube-hitting-white-supremacists-where-it-hurts/\">online harassment</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/04/04/youtube-shooting-misinformation-spreads-by-inaccurate-report-and-lots-of-trolls/\">misinformation</url>. In an attempt to better understand what is happening in this video universe, Pew Research Center published a new report on Thursday entitled \"A Week in the Life of Popular YouTube Channels.\" In the report, Pew researchers analyzed 43,770 YouTube channels with at least 250,000 subscribers, and the videos they posted during the first week of 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their findings - which provide a fresh perspective on the actual content of YouTube's programming, - are disconcerting, to say the least. According to the analysis, these 43,770 YouTube channels produced a quarter-million videos over the course of the first week of 2019. These videos totaled 48,486 hours of content. Each video was an average of 12 minutes long, and received 14.2 billion views during the first week.</p><p>Of these videos, only 17 percent were in English, indicating that YouTube's popularity extends far across the globe. Insights into who is producing this content were also revealed.. A small share of the creators produced a majority of the content generated during the first week: 10 percent of the 43,770 YouTube channels produced 70 percent of all the videos posted by the channels analyzed.</p><p>Pew Research Center conducted a separate examination of the English-language videos, 37,079 of them in total, over the same period, in which they categorized each video and scrutinized the video titles and keywords. They found that videos targeting children were the most popular, along with videos that cast or presented children under the age of 13. The finding is crucial, the researchers explained in the study, because YouTube is not intended for children. \"It should be noted that YouTube explicitly states that the platform is not intended for children under the age of 13,\" the researchers asserted.</p><p>YouTube provides a separate YouTube Kids platform with parental controls.</p><p>The presence of so many videos targeted towards, or featuring children, is both puzzling and alarming. Obviously many YouTube videos contain political, advertorial or persuasive messaging in some form; psychologists have known for decades that children are far more persuadable than adults, which is why there is far more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2012/11/30/7_disturbing_trends_in_junk_food_advertising_for_children/\">regulation around advertising towards children</url>. Children also love       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/01/14/why-is-my-kid-obsessed-with-youtube-stars_partner/\">watching and mimicking other children around their age</url> for deep-seated social reasons.</p><p>The preponderance of YouTube videos for or by kids suggests that some creators may be taking advantage of these psychological windows of opportunity. The report goes into the specifics:</p><p>Notably, a large majority of the videos that featured children were not intended exclusively for a young audience. This analysis estimates that just 21% of videos featuring children were directed toward young children to the exclusion of other audiences. Similarly, only a minority of children's videos (13% of those posted) contained footage of a child that appeared to be under the age of 13. But the small share of videos at the intersection of these two categories - that is, videos that were both aimed at children and featured a child under the age of 13 - were one of the single-most popular video categories captured in this analysis, averaging four times as many views (416,985 vs. 96,416) as general-audience videos that did not feature a child (70,909 vs. 13,748 median). The majority of videos that included a child (79%) were oriented toward a general audience rather than children specifically.</p><p>In videos containing spoken English, the researchers also found that videos that were about politics tended to have an international focus, not an American one.</p><p>\"Videos explicitly related to current events or politics were relatively common, comprising 16% of all English language videos uploaded during the study period,\" Pew researchers asserted in the study. \"However, the majority of these videos were international in focus and did not mention events, issues or opinions related to the United States.\"</p><p>Finally, researchers found that videos involving video games \"was a fixture of popular channels on YouTube.\"</p><p>The report comes at a pivotal moment. On Tuesday this week, the Department of Justice announced it was opening an antitrust review of \"market-leading online platforms.\" It is the first probe of its kind, and could likely fuel more calls to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, YouTube's parent company.</p><p>While the content created and viewed on YouTube is immeasurable, its staggering financial clout is another story entirely. The lack of transparency around the company's financials has frustrated industry analysts.</p><p>\"I think their reticence to provide information borders on paranoia, as if they would be admitting failure if they allowed us to discover whether one of their businesses was performing more poorly than expected,\" Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/youtube-financial-disclosure-google.html\">The New York Times</url>.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1564081246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH2-0W51-JCBN-1105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Salon.com, LLC.

Because slowly, then all at once, it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It's probably no surprise, considering the complex problems the tech industry faces. As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:</p><p>  As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom's Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank's giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape -- $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis' funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.</p><p>  [Kara Swisher will answer your questions about this column on Twitter on Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern: @KaraSwisher.]</p><p>Facebook introduced a new home video device called Portal, and promised that what could be seen as a surveillance tool would not share data for the sake of ad targeting. Soon after, as reported by Recode, Facebook admitted that ''data about who you call and data about which apps you use on Portal can be used to target you with ads on other Facebook-owned properties.'' Oh. Um. That's awkward.</p><p>  After agreeing to pay $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an ill-advised tweet about possible funding (from the Saudis, by the way), the Tesla co-founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>proceeded to troll the regulatory agency on, you got it, Twitter. And even though the settlement called for some kind of control of his communications, it appears that Mr. Musk will continue tweeting until someone steals his phone.</p><p>  Finally, Google took six months to make public that user data on its social network, Google Plus, had been exposed and that profiles of up to 500,000 users may have been compromised. While the service failed long ago, because it was pretty much designed by antisocial people, this lack of concern for privacy was profound.</p><p>  Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It's an ethical swamp out there.</p><p>  That's why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business -- like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government's policy of separating immigrant families at the border.</p><p>  Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues.</p><p>  At a recent company event, he elaborated: ''We can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.''</p><p>23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer. In an interview I did this week with its chief executive, Anne Wojcicki, she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates, but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues. She acknowledged that the collection of DNA data is rife with ethical considerations, but said, ''I think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set, rather than just hire one person to determine this.''</p><p>  When asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics, some point out that legal or diversity/inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top -- the chief executive.</p><p>  Also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or, worse, get steamrollered. And, if the person was bad at the job, of course, it could drag the whole thing down.</p><p>  Others are more worried that the move would be nothing but window dressing. One consultant who focuses on ethics, but did not want to be named, told me: ''We haven't even defined ethics, so what even is ethical use, especially for Silicon Valley companies that are babies in this game?''</p><p>  How can an industry that, unlike other business sectors, persistently promotes itself as doing good, learn to do that in reality? Do you want to not do harm, or do you want to do good? These are two totally different things.</p><p>  And how do you put an official ethical system in place without it seeming like you're telling everyone how to behave? Who gets to decide those rules anyway, setting a moral path for the industry and -- considering tech companies' enormous power -- the world.</p><p>  Like I said, adult supervision. Or maybe, better still, Silicon Valley itself has to grow up.</p><p>  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY MIGUEL SCHINCARIOL/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE -- GETTY IMAGES)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-705993181022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ9-11H1-JBG3-6435-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/opinion/who-will-teach-silicon-valley-to-be-ethical.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/opinion/who-will-teach-silicon-valley-to-be-ethical.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 22, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This managed cloud platform service covers Backbase's entire portfolio of banking products, helping banks to innovate with speed whilst reducing their costly operational hurdles. At present, banks face a twofold threat; both from more technologically-capable neo-bank competitors and, more recently, from the expansion of big tech into banking. </p><p>In this new digital environment, agility and fast time to market is key. To support banks in keeping pace, Backbase-as-a-Service provides financial institutions with the technological infrastructure to develop and release new services to their customers more swiftly. With less time dedicated to set-up, updates and security, banks can focus on innovating and allocating more resources to new features that enhance the overall experience for customers. Lowering time to market, while eliminating upfront capital investments on hardware and maintenance of aging technology, Backbase-as-a-Service becomes the ideal innovation partner. As banks grow, they can increase or decrease computing capacity as needed as Backbase-as-a-Service is based on usage-based spending. This allows for higher business flexibility and a faster response to market shifts. Commenting on the launch, Jouk Pleiter, CEO, said: 'Backbase is committed to being the leading innovation partner for global banks and credit unions. We believe the move to cloud is an unstoppable one, and one which every financial institution needs to embrace. Our clients want the freedom to innovate and maintain their competitive edge, so launching Backbase-as-a-Service is the logical step for us. It is our duty to maximise their ROI when it comes to becoming digital-first and meeting the digital demands of their customers. Cloud is an exceptional tool for taking that leap.' Thomas Fuss, VP Technology, added: 'The improved service will significantly benefit banks both in terms of reducing overhead on IT and delivering superior digital banking experiences to their clients. It's another step forward in helping clients unlock their digital potential. Undertaking the transition to the Backbase cloud means our clients are always tapping into the latest innovations and features that our platform offers. Cloud adoption has been relatively slow in banking so we're proud to provide clients with a state-of-the-art managed service which is always available, always secure and always packed with the latest innovations.' Along with the business value of innovating at scale and reducing IT overhead, the newly announced Backbase-as-a-Service will offer banks: - Managed Software ...rdware Updates - 99.9%+ Uptime - Shared or Dedicated Backbase Environment - Multiple Sandbox Environments - Database Backups ...dundancy - Scalable Infrastructure - End-to-End Encryption - Regulatory Compliance The platform is immediately available worldwide. ### About Backbase Backbase's Digital-First Banking Platform powers seamless customer experiences, unifying data and functionality from core banking systems and innovative fintech partners.

Your phone beeps to tell you a newly-opened restaurant nearby is offering free Peking duck. You open up the app to read more, and in addition it gives you list of deals and promotions based on your GPS coordinates. This is what real-time, location and algorithm based deals aggregator app Tuitui promises to do, when it launches within the next month. </p><p>Tuitui, which translates to   push-push   in Mandarin, is so-named because it uses push notifications on smartphones to alert users whenever they are deals nearby.   During weekdays, the service capacity is usually not fully utilised in shops. So some merchants will have the need to push very attractive, exclusive promotions to get customers in,  said co-founder Zhao Liang. He added:   We will only selectively target potential consumers so that push notifications are useful, not annoying.  While there are apps in the marketplace that perform similar functions, like HungryDeals and Groupon, Mr Zhao believe Tuitui is unique because it focuses on shopping malls and is backed by a killer algorithm. Explaining that Tuitui's competitive edge lies in its ability to leverage big data analytics, Mr Zhao said the app can identify which users to push what type of promotions to. This is made possible because the app  s algorithm takes into consideration several factors besides user location, including search history and the frequency of app use. The 25 year-old, a graduate of the National University of Singapore  s School of Computing, said the idea for Tuitui was seeded in his final year of studies in 2014.   It started out as an idea to help promote perishable products and eliminate food wastage,  said Mr Zhao, referring to sushi and pastries that are heavily marked down for sale after a certain time in the day. By Jan 2016, the app evolved into an aggregator for shopping malls, because it made more sense for a lean start-up to deals with malls instead of individual shops. Tuitui demo   The malls gather information on deals and promotions from their shop tenants and put this out on their individual websites. But very few shopping malls have an in-house mobile app, and it  s not also feasible for consumers to download an app for each mall,  he explained.   So a neutral mobile app, which acts as an information integrator, is in need - for both shopping malls and consumers.  Tuitui  s aim is to cover the 100-odd malls in Singapore, as well as gain a critical mass of about 10,000 users. After it has hit these two milestones, Mr Zhao said the firm wants to monetise by charging malls and tenants to send push notifications. It will then also consider expanding to other Southeast Asian markets, like Indonesia and Malaysia. He does not intend to introduce Tuitui to his native China for two reasons. He has no immediate plans to leave Singapore, and there is a possibility that big tech players there - Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent - can develop a copycat app and corner the Chinese market based on their scale. Tuitui was co-founded with Mr Ju Chaoran, Mr Zhao  s friend of seven years and a batchmate at the NUS School of Computing. Both of them have been working full-time on Tuitui for two years now, taking care of every aspect of the business, from programming to accounting, and meeting investors and mall managers.   I sleep on the floor of our office a lot,  Mr Zhao admits, when asked about life as an entrepreneur.   We both write code. But we didn  t know how to build a mobile app. So we had to go teach ourselves. And we had two to learn two operating systems as well! iOS and Android,  he said with a laugh. A third co-founder is Mr Zhao  s former university lecturer, Associate Professor of Information Systems Jack Zhenhui Jiang, who acts as Tuitui  s advisor and mentor. Mr Zhao, who has been living here since arriving seven years ago on a Singapore Government scholarship, plans to stay put and grow his business from Singapore.B  This is because Singapore has a conducive business environment and supportive infrastructure, in the form of the Government's Smart Nation push, he said. \"Culturally speaking, I'm more familiar with Singapore than with China by now. I'm also more comfortable with the social norms and government regulations here,\" said the Hainan native, adding that his parents are supportive of his venture, although they are unlikely to want to relocate to Singapore. Mr Zhao counts tech titans Masayoshi Son of SoftBank and Elon Musk of Tesla as sources of inspiration. He said,   I  m determined to make it work. For an IT professional, what can be more exciting than to use IT to shape the world, and make it a better place?  Tuitui is being supported by Mediacorp's incubator programme, the Mediapreneur (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www16.mediacorp.sg/themediapreneur/\">http://www16.mediacorp.sg/themediapreneur/</url>),B which provides start-ups with seed funding, a working space, mentoring, networking opportunities and attractive media packages to speed up their growth and development.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-2877666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K1H-1TW1-DYWP-R0DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>12:54 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 MCN International Pte Ltd.

'Rioting, looting and burning our cities, George Soros, Hollywood elites and Joe Biden's staff are funding Antifa.'The spot is similar to an ad recently banned from Facebook for having a prominent weapon. In all, Greene spent over $106,000 on Facebook ads[4], more than double what the next highest-spending candidate in the race spent on online ads[5]. The controversy earned her a barrage[6] of press[7] just before the June 9 primary.Greene has raised and spent more than the other eight candidates running for a House seat left open by Rep. Tom Graves'[8] (R-Ga.) </p><p>resignation. The Associated Press called the race one of Georgia's most competitive primaries[9]. She is also one of dozens of candidates [10]running for federal office across the country that have promoted the alt-right QAnon conspiracy theory, six of whom have already guaranteed a spot on November's ballots.Like several other QAnon supporting candidates, Marjorie Greene has the backing of several members of President Donald Trump'[11]s inner-circle. But unlike most, she has a real shot of winning a seat come November. As of May 20, she has outraised the rest of them combined, including Oregon U.S. Senate candidate Jo Rae Perkins[12], who recently won her state's primary[13].Dog whistles evoking alt-right conspiracy theories are a major part of Greene's campaign, and were also central to her rise to political prominence[14].Since 2017, Greene has built a social media following on the far right through confrontational videos with prominent left-leaning figures. In one video, Greene accused David Hogg[15], a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, of 'using kids' to push an anti-gun agenda. In another, she accused Rep. Rashida Tlaib[16] (D-Mich.) of being an illegitimate congressperson because she was sworn in with a Quran instead of a Bible.Greene used her platform to voice her support for QAnon \u2014 an alt-right conspiracy theory[17] that began on the online message board 4chan and purports that a cabal of left-wing pedophiles has taken over the U.S. government.One of Greene's largest vendors, which her campaign paid over $45,000, is Elections LLC[18], a political law firm that represents candidates and committees. The firm is run by former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino[19], who also represented Trump[20] during his fight against Democratic congressional subpoenas after leaving his White House role.According to Greene, Passantino was hired as her attorney and Elections LLC as her FEC compliance team. Passantino did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Elections LLC also received $290,000 from the Trump campaign this cycle and $60,000 from the Republican National Committee[21].Other prominent Trump allies have also bolstered Greene's campaign. The House Freedom Fund[22], a PAC associated with Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows[23], spent $44,000 backing Greene and delivered $78,000 in earmarked contributions[24] to her campaign. Greene also received endorsements from prominent Rep. Jim Jordan[25] (R-Ohio), the House Freedom Caucus and the gun rights group Gun Owners of America[26].Another member of Trump's orbit with ties to QAnon-boosting candidates is Roger Kiger[27], who founded an early pro-Trump super PAC, Citizens for Restoring USA[28], in 2015. First hearing about the super PAC in an interview with the Washington Post[29], Trump claimed not to know Kiger, who is a Mar-A-Lago regular. In the same interview, Kiger also called Trump a 'friend,' but clarified by saying that Trump would likely not know who he was.Yet a few years later, Kiger was driving Trump's limousine[30] in the presidential motorcade and claimed to have gotten a tour[31] of Air Force One, according to pictures[32] and statements[33] on Kiger's social media. The Secret Service regularly uses unpaid volunteers[34] as motorcade drivers.Kiger is also listed as a vendor for Florida candidate Michael Bluemling Jr.[35], another candidate who has tweeted support[36] for QAnon, as well as the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, according to Media Matters. Republican House candidates James Bradley and Nicholas Vessio, running for California's 33rd District and Florida's 18th District respectively, have also listed Kiger as a vendor.Vessio recently appeared on the YouTube show 'Steel Truth,' hosted by QAnon supporter Ann Vandersteel, where he discussed his baseless belief that Imams are sneaking into Mexico and converting immigrants to Islam before they enter the U.S. Bradley has made claims on social media that Democrats committed crimes against humanity and has also stoked anti-immigrant sentiment with claims that looser border regulation would mean 'destroying innocent lives.'Bluemling dropped out of the Florida race, saying the COVID-19 pandemic prevented him from getting enough signatures[37] to qualify. Vessio's primary is Aug. 18. Bradley placed second in an open primary, but is unlikely to win in November in California's blue 33rd District.Of the dozens of candidates who have run in a primary campaign either currently supporting or having previously supported QAnon conspiracy theories, six will appear on a ballot in November. Another, Texas' 16th District candidate Samuel Williams[38], received the most votes in his primary, but will face a runoff. Twelve, including Greene, still have primaries ahead.The Southern Poverty Law Center put Marjorie Greene on their hate-watch list because of her anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook, as well her ties to known militia groups including the Three Percenters. The post Backed by Trump allies, QAnon promoter vies for Georgia House seat[39] appeared first on OpenSecrets News[40].

'Rioting, looting and burning our cities, George Soros, Hollywood elites and Joe Biden's staff are funding Antifa.'The spot is similar to an ad recently banned from Facebook for having a prominent weapon. In all, Greene spent over $106,000 on Facebook ads[4], more than double what the next highest-spending candidate in the race spent on online ads[5]. The controversy earned her a barrage[6] of press[7] just before the June 9 primary.Greene has raised and spent more than the other eight candidates running for a House seat left open by Rep. Tom Graves'[8] (R-Ga.) </p><p>resignation. The Associated Press called the race one of Georgia's most competitive primaries[9]. She is also one of dozens of candidates [10]running for federal office across the country that have promoted the alt-right QAnon conspiracy theory, six of whom have already guaranteed a spot on November's ballots.Like several other QAnon supporting candidates, Marjorie Greene has the backing of several members of President Donald Trump'[11]s inner-circle. But unlike most, she has a real shot of winning a seat come November. As of May 20, she has outraised the rest of them combined, including Oregon U.S. Senate candidate Jo Rae Perkins[12], who recently won her state's primary[13].Dog whistles evoking alt-right conspiracy theories are a major part of Greene's campaign, and were also central to her rise to political prominence[14].Since 2017, Greene has built a social media following on the far right through confrontational videos with prominent left-leaning figures. In one video, Greene accused David Hogg[15], a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, of 'using kids' to push an anti-gun agenda. In another, she accused Rep. Rashida Tlaib[16] (D-Mich.) of being an illegitimate congressperson because she was sworn in with a Quran instead of a Bible.Greene used her platform to voice her support for QAnon   an alt-right conspiracy theory[17] that began on the online message board 4chan and purports that a cabal of left-wing pedophiles has taken over the U.S. government.One of Greene's largest vendors, which her campaign paid over $45,000, is Elections LLC[18], a political law firm that represents candidates and committees. The firm is run by former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino[19], who also represented Trump[20] during his fight against Democratic congressional subpoenas after leaving his White House role.According to Greene, Passantino was hired as her attorney and Elections LLC as her FEC compliance team. Passantino did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Elections LLC also received $290,000 from the Trump campaign this cycle and $60,000 from the Republican National Committee[21].Other prominent Trump allies have also bolstered Greene's campaign. The House Freedom Fund[22], a PAC associated with Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows[23], spent $44,000 backing Greene and delivered $78,000 in earmarked contributions[24] to her campaign. Greene also received endorsements from prominent Rep. Jim Jordan[25] (R-Ohio), the House Freedom Caucus and the gun rights group Gun Owners of America[26].Another member of Trump's orbit with ties to QAnon-boosting candidates is Roger Kiger[27], who founded an early pro-Trump super PAC, Citizens for Restoring USA[28], in 2015. First hearing about the super PAC in an interview with the Washington Post[29], Trump claimed not to know Kiger, who is a Mar-A-Lago regular. In the same interview, Kiger also called Trump a 'friend,' but clarified by saying that Trump would likely not know who he was.Yet a few years later, Kiger was driving Trump's limousine[30] in the presidential motorcade and claimed to have gotten a tour[31] of Air Force One, according to pictures[32] and statements[33] on Kiger's social media. The Secret Service regularly uses unpaid volunteers[34] as motorcade drivers.Kiger is also listed as a vendor for Florida candidate Michael Bluemling Jr.[35], another candidate who has tweeted support[36] for QAnon, as well as the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, according to Media Matters. Republican House candidates James Bradley and Nicholas Vessio, running for California's 33rd District and Florida's 18th District respectively, have also listed Kiger as a vendor.Vessio recently appeared on the YouTube show 'Steel Truth,' hosted by QAnon supporter Ann Vandersteel, where he discussed his baseless belief that Imams are sneaking into Mexico and converting immigrants to Islam before they enter the U.S. Bradley has made claims on social media that Democrats committed crimes against humanity and has also stoked anti-immigrant sentiment with claims that looser border regulation would mean 'destroying innocent lives.'Bluemling dropped out of the Florida race, saying the COVID-19 pandemic prevented him from getting enough signatures[37] to qualify. Vessio's primary is Aug. 18. Bradley placed second in an open primary, but is unlikely to win in November in California's blue 33rd District.Of the dozens of candidates who have run in a primary campaign either currently supporting or having previously supported QAnon conspiracy theories, six will appear on a ballot in November. Another, Texas' 16th District candidate Samuel Williams[38], received the most votes in his primary, but will face a runoff. Twelve, including Greene, still have primaries ahead.The Southern Poverty Law Center put Marjorie Greene on their hate-watch list because of her anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook, as well her ties to known militia groups including the Three Percenters. The post Backed by Trump allies, QAnon promoter vies for Georgia House seat[39] appeared first on OpenSecrets News[40].

The other bill would extend the review period for background checks from three to 10 days.</p><p> Both bills face dim prospects in the Republican-controlled Senate and veto threats from President Donald Trump, who said they would impose unreasonable requirements on gun owners.</p><p> Just eight Republicans joined 232 Democrats to support the bill, while only two Democrats voted against it.</p><p> The White House said in a veto message that the background-checks bill could block someone from borrowing a firearm for self-defense or allowing a neighbor to take care of a gun while traveling.</p><p> Democrats called those arguments misleading and said gun owners have a responsibility to ensure firearms are properly handled. The bill includes exceptions allowing temporary transfers to prevent imminent harm or for use at a target range.</p><p> The long-delayed bill would merely close loopholes to ensure that background checks are extended to private and online sales that often go undetected, Democrats said.</p><p> \u201cPeople who are felons or are dangerously mentally ill shouldn\u2019t have guns,\u201d regardless of whether they buy them from a federally licensed dealer or their next-door neighbor, said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., a key sponsor who has pushed for expanded background checks since the 2012 killing of 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Connecticut.</p><p> \u201cFor six-and-a-half years, we had no cooperation from the past majority\u201d in the House, Thompson said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a hearing on the bill. We couldn\u2019t get a vote. Today, we\u2019re here to tell you it\u2019s a new day. With this (Democratic) majority, we have made a commitment to address the issue of gun violence.\u201d</p><p> While Republicans mostly opposed the bill, the GOP scored a procedural victory when the House accepted a Republican amendment requiring that gun sellers notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an illegal immigrant tries to buy a gun. Twenty-six Democrats joined with Republicans to support the amendment, offered by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga.</p><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed the GOP proposal, saying, \u201cWe won a big victory  get the message.\u201d</p><p> Pelosi, D-Calif., called the House vote \u201chistoric\u201d and hailed the bill as \u201ca long-overdue, commonsense action to end the epidemic of gun violence in America.\u201d</p><p> To demonstrate her support for the bill, Pelosi wore an orange dress while other Democrats wore orange ties or scarves, the color used by the movement against gun violence.</p><p> Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said she hopes the symbolism will soon become obsolete.</p><p> \u201cI long for the day when orange scarves are a fashion statement, not a cry for help,\u201d said Dean, who was wearing a bright orange scarf.</p><p> House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was gravely wounded in a 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice, said stricter background checks would not have prevented his shooting or other tragedies.</p><p> \u201cWhat it would do is make criminals out of law-abiding citizens,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIf you go hunting with a friend and your friend wants to borrow your rifle, you better bring your attorney with you because depending on what you do with that gun you may be a felon if you loan it to him.\u201d</p><p> Democrats said the bill includes exceptions allowing temporary transfers for anyone who feels threatened by a domestic partner or other person. The bill also allows a gun owner to loan their weapon and for use at a target range.</p><p> \u201cThere is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them by circumventing the background check process,\u201d said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The background checks bill would \u201cclose this dangerous loophole and save lives,\u201d Nadler said.</p><p> Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said the bill \u201cfoolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will suddenly submit themselves to background checks.\u201d</p><p> Democrats and other bill supporters are \u201cdelusional\u201d if they think \u201ca criminal trading cocaine to another criminal for a firearm will reconsider due to\u201d the background checks bill, he said.</p><p> But Kris Brown, president of Brady, a gun control group formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the bill will save lives.</p><p> Brown called the House vote \u201ca monumental step forward for gun violence prevention in our country\u201d and hailed Thompson and other lawmakers who pushed for the measure.</p><p> \u201cOn to the Senate!\u201d she said.</p><p>Associated Press writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.</p><p> OPINION</p><p> When Will We Ever Learn?</p><p> By Ellen Lindeen</p><p> On Tuesday evening, February 27, 2019, I attended a beautiful, yet painful, event, entitled, \u201cVigil in Remembrance of Those Affected by Gun Violence.\u201d The event, sponsored by Moms Demand Action, was at a local church, in my hometown, in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Names of those who have been killed were read. Hopeful statements by survivors were also read by attendees, and while the familiar sites of many shootings were also named (Columbine, San Bernardino, Orlando, Sandy Hook \u2026 sadly, the list went on and on), we all lit candles. I was prepared to be there I thought. As a college professor of more than two decades, so many shootings have taken place at schools, that at the start of each semester, I have always looked around my classroom and imagined what I would do and say to protect students if someone with a gun appeared at the door.</p><p> Part of my usual classroom routine has always been to put quotes on the board for students each day we met. I have a long list of favorites, but the list continues to grow. In 2015, I felt I had to add the following when I learned the details. A fellow English instructor at a community college was killed on the first day of class. As a tribute to his life, I wrote on the board for my students:</p><p> \u201c\u2019Today is the first day of the rest of your life,\u2019 written on the board on the first day of class in introductory Writing 115, at Umpqua Community College in Oregon by adjunct English professor, Larry Levine, 67, before he was shot along with nine others by a lone gunman.\u201d</p><p> Honestly, I have become a bit numb when I hear of another shooting, but I still pay attention. Students in my classes in the last few years were born about the time of the Columbine shooting, so they\u2019ve grown up with active-shooter drills. Yet, I still came to a difficult realization at the Vigil as I was listening to the featured speaker, Lauren Carr, a survivor from the 2008 shooting at Northern Illinois University. She explained that she was in the third row when someone entered her lecture hall at the right of the stage and began shooting. All the students around her were hit. Her laptop took a bullet and her seat had bullet holes, but somehow she escaped. She spoke bravely about her fears since the event, followed by anger, and then therapy, and now her active practice of looking for good in others.</p><p> Carr went on to explain that just a year ago, she and other survivors met in DeKalb, Illinois, on the NIU campus for the 10-year anniversary of the shooting, February 14, 2018. Many had stayed in touch but it was helpful to be together, facilitated by university professionals, to discuss their progress, to remember their friends, and to commemorate that they were still here and thriving, or at least attempting to thrive. Then Carr paused, and explained at a certain point during their reunion, some of them started getting texts, and then all of them did. The information they received revealed the facts of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida actively taking place. Ten years later, on Valentine\u2019s Day again, another mass shooting disrupted our country, killed more young people, and destroyed the faith and trust the survivors from NIU were just beginning to feel.</p><p> Astounded, I realized that when the Parkland shooting occurred, I didn\u2019t put the date together with the shooting at NIU exactly 10 years earlier. How common must these shootings have become for me, despite actively seeking for ways to prevent one in my own classroom, that the same date did not even register. I had not lost a loved one at NIU, but perhaps I just subconsciously decided to let February 14 stay Valentine\u2019s Day?</p><p> Most Americans know we have a gun problem in the United States, but are we still looking for solutions? Thankfully, the Parkland students launched the March for Our Lives that many of us participated in, but have universal background checks been passed into law yet? Just last week, a gunman killed five people at a place of business in the city of Aurora, IL. A student from NIU was an intern there, reporting for his first day of work. Is this ever going to stop? When will it ever end? When will we ever learn?</p><p> Ellen Lindeen, syndicated by PeaceVoice,is an Emeritus Professor of English at Waubonsee Community College where she taught Peace Studies &amp; Conflict Resolution and Human Rights &amp; Social Justice.</p><p> The Conversation</p><p> A new way to pay for innovative drugs, provide universal access and not break the bank</p><p> February 28, 2019</p><p> Author: Neeraj Sood, Professor of Public Policy, University of Southern California</p><p> Disclosure statement: Neeraj Sood has been a paid scientific advisor to several organizations in the health care industry including health insurers, drug distributors, pharmacuetical firms, economic consulting firms, litigation consulting firms, health care start-ups, and professional organizations.</p><p> Partners: University of Southern California provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.</p><p> On the heels of congressional testimony by the CEOs of major drug makers, there are some important things to keep in mind. The U.S. faces a drug pricing crisis in large part because pharmaceuticals are in a golden age of advancement. A new pill cures hepatitis C. Immunotherapies devour cancer cells. Regenerative medicine promises longer life spans.</p><p> All of that advancement comes at a high cost. Drug companies seek recovery through high prices, which guarantees profits but reduces widespread access to the remedies. In particular, Medicaid, the federal and state health program for the poor, disabled and elderly, which enrolls 70 million Americans, faces major hurdles in paying for lifesaving treatments.</p><p> It has turned into a politically explosive predicament. A National Academies of Science consensus report which I was involved with and a paper in a leading medical journal that I authored suggests a way out, and Louisiana will be the first state to put this solution into practice.</p><p> A novel approach in a very poor state</p><p>Louisiana, which has a severe hepatitis C problem, is on the cusp of proving to other states that drug companies can make the money they need, while every Medicaid recipient who needs a cure gets one.</p><p> Nationally the hepatitis C story is a scandal. Even with a cure on the market, more than 20,000 Americans still die of the disease each year, more than the combined toll of 60 other infectious diseases. The reason for this high death toll is the high price tag of the curative drugs and as a result Medicaid restricts access to these drugs.</p><p> In Louisiana, only 384 of the 35,000 infected people who are on Medicaid or in prison got treatment in 2017 because of the prohibitive cost. Prices have dropped by two-thirds from the introductory level of US$80,000 per treatment, but even at that level eliminating the disease among Medicaid recipients would cost the state $700 million. Louisiana, which like other states shoulders part of Medicaid costs with the federal government, could afford that only if it blew up its budget for schools and health care, among other services.</p><p> The state is now on a path to secure immediate treatment for all infected prisoners and people on Medicaid by buying a license from a drug company. It is a concept that can be applied to other ground breaking remedies. The idea was first outlined in a consensus report for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and later in a paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Here is how it will work:</p><p>Louisiana spent $35 million last year on hepatitis C treatments spread among several pharmaceutical companies. On Jan. 10, 2019, the state announced that it intends to use that amount as leverage, drawing the companies into a competition for the state\u2019s business.</p><p>Louisiana is seeking to negotiate a contract with a single drug manufacturer to provide all the hepatitis pills the state needs for a lump sum, payable annually over a five-year contract that is roughly equal to the state\u2019s current $35 million hepatitis C spending among all makers. Once a contract is signed in April, the company that won the contract will stand ready to supply as many pills as the state requires. The price-per-pill model disappears, so Louisiana can treat as many patients as it wants without worrying about the costs of treating additional patients.</p><p>Louisiana State Health Director Rebekah Gee spearheaded the effort to establish a license after the NAS study was published. The strategy exploits market competition among firms in a voluntary transaction that nevertheless breaks the current stranglehold high prices have over access to the medicines.</p><p> Under the status quo of \u201cprice-based contracting,\u201d firms derive profits from high prices, which in turn means reduced access to the drugs. Instead, the Louisiana system is based on what is called \u201crevenue based contracting,\u201d which severs the link between profits and restricted access. That is, a firm that wins the contract with the state can ensure profitability by negotiating an appropriate lump sum payment, guaranteed over five years. Once a lump sum payment is set, the state\u2019s cost of providing drugs to additional patients is close to zero because the contract stipulates that the pharmaceutical company is obligated to meet the volume of the state\u2019s needs.</p><p> The question now is will drug makers participate in a competition to license their product to the state. The early outlook is positive. Gilead and Merck, makers of major hepatitis C drugs, both told the state in 2018 that they were interested, and AbbVie has said it intends to participate.</p><p> The deadline for submitting a proposed contract is Feb. 28, 2019, and the state hopes to implement the program by July 1. At that point, Louisiana could begin eradicating hepatitis C in its Medicaid and prison populations.</p><p> Other states should not be far behind. A long-awaited report from the National Governors Association on controlling drug costs endorsed the idea. In January 2019, Washington state began soliciting bids from drug makers for a guaranteed price for its Medicaid beneficiaries.</p><p> There is every reason to believe that the licensing model will work for containing costs of other expensive new drugs as well. States, or a consortium of states, can offer long-term contracts that can assure drug companies of the return they need to satisfy shareholders and pay for development costs. The large number of possible contracts in the 50 states means there is plenty of business for companies to seek.</p><p> Licenses are a time-tested way to guarantee streams of revenue to manufacturers while lowering users\u2019 marginal costs to zero. This model is common in many knowledge-based industries such as software where product development costs are high but once a product is developed, the cost of providing the product to an additional user is close to zero. It\u2019s time to implement this pricing model in health care. It can lead us out of our prescription drug crisis by bringing universal access without breaking the bank.</p><p> Llewellyn King: Will Smart Cities Be Haven for New Kind of Lawyer?</p><p> By Llewellyn King</p><p> InsideSources.com</p><p> SAN ANTONIO  Disruption equals opportunity. That was the message that came across loud at a conference here organized by CPS Energy, the local gas and electric utility, on smart cities  a revolution that is underway and surging.</p><p> Simply, smart cities are convergence of digital technologies, from street lights to driverless vehicles. Cities  there are more than 19,000 of them in the world  represent a great new vista of business opportunity for new entrepreneurs.</p><p> Coincidentally, a small but distinguished law school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, is, in its way, seeking to upend the traditional expectations of law students by teaching them law plus innovation and entrepreneurism.</p><p> Dickinson Law, founded in 1834 and is now part of The Pennsylvania State University, but operates autonomously, is seeking to turn out a new kind of lawyer: One who is interested in becoming an entrepreneur rather than simply practicing law.</p><p> The program is the concept of Samantha Prince, assistant professor of legal writing and entrepreneurship, who had been an entrepreneur as well as a lawyer. She told me that she wanted the Dickinson Law students to realize what a useful and versatile tool a law degree is, and how it can offer those who have one a wide range of opportunities beyond the traditional practice of law.</p><p> Prince, with the energetic support of dean Gary Gildin, told me many students have not come to Dickinson Law straight out of college but have had work experience, which makes them more open to a wider range of possibilities.</p><p> A partner at one of the large law firms in Washington told me that she wishes her education at one of the nation\u2019s top law schools had been just a little less academic and broader. She said the curriculum was fascinating, but much of it was arcane and directed to the study of the history of law and its seminal turning points. No thought was given to the idea that she might want to use her legal knowledge in any other way than to practice law, probably in a big firm. That she has done.</p><p> Lawyers, of course, have always been entrepreneurial. But Prince says that has been in the confines of the profession.</p><p> Prince wants her students to think about  at least some of them  how they can use their legal knowledge to start a business, pulling together investors, creators and visionaries.</p><p> The faculty at Dickinson Law wants to see some students take their chances and test their mettle in the marketplace. One problem: The study of law is a study of what can go wrong, and new business is a belief in what might go right.</p><p> Prince\u2019s students have something of an advantage as they tend to be older and to have had real-life experience. Already some of them are thinking of law differently: Zachary Gihorski wants to use his legal training to lead and shape the future of agriculture; Christian Wolgemuth wants to enter cybersecurity practice and eventually become an entrepreneur; and Ana Anvari wants to serve health care businesses by advising them on health care regulation and helping them to start up or expand their businesses.</p><p> Those who are thinking of self-employment may find the new vitality in cities a place of opportunity. The cities are going to be wide open to everything from better electric vehicle charging to automated garbage collection, to repair and maintenance of the automated systems, to restaurants delivering meals by drone. If you can think of it, it will probably be needed.</p><p> Although the big tech companies, from Google to Tesla, AT&amp;T to Verizon and Amazon to IBM, are salivating over the new smart city opportunities. History teaches that great fortunes are made by new players when, so to speak, the ground shifts.</p><p> The ground is shifting in cities like San Antonio, Chula Vista, Calif., Boston and Houston.</p><p> Smart cities represent a huge entrepreneurial chance for smart people  lawyers and otherwise.</p><p> ABOUT THE WRITER</p><p> Llewellyn King is executive producer and host of \u201cWhite House Chronicle\u201d on PBS.

Questions from politicians generally split down party lines: Republicans complain about what they see as platform content bias against conservatives, while Democrats are the interrogators on the bulk of issues that are ostensibly the point of the hearings.</p><p>There's an odd disconnect. The same politicians and their parties utilise and place ads on the very platforms they lambaste. Or perhaps, this is less of a disconnect than the evidence that backs their arguments that the platforms are too-powerful information and disinformation gateways (Facebook, notably, still refuses to remove ads in which politicians lie).</p><p>But when the people are all on these few platforms, politicians and parties have to follow. Just like all of us, who (despite the denials of the tech chief executives) really have no alternative place to go.</p><p>Yet both presidential candidates also have connections to the technology sector. US president Donald Trump - even as he rails against the big platforms in his tweets - has had support from, among others, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and two of PayPal's original leaders, Tesla/SpaceX founder Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, of secretive big data analytics company Palantir.</p><p>Unlike Trump, democratic candidate Joe Biden hasn't (yet) gone on a major public offensive against technology companies, and hasn't - unlike his former presidential primary challengers, democrat Elizabeth Warren and independent Bernie Sanders - incorporated a top-line campaign promise to break up and regulate the tech giants.</p><p>Biden's vice-presidential partner on the ticket, California senator Kamala Harris, is San Francisco Bay Area based and has long-standing support from Silicon Valley. In addition, several of Biden's election aides have been drawn from the ranks of Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, according to the New York Times.</p><h>Growing impetus </h><p>But that doesn't seem too likely to derail the growing impetus, politically and from the general public, for Washington to \"do something\" about an industry that wields such immense, obscured power in our public and private lives. And there's strong backing from within both the Republican and Democrat sides to take on big tech.</p><p>The outcome of the most recent sets of congressional hearings is a report that Democrat\u00a0David Cicilline, chairman of the House judiciary antitrust subcommittee, recently said will aim to \"rehabilitate\" old antitrust laws to break up some of the biggest tech platforms, which he said \"increasingly used their gatekeeper power in abusive and coercive ways\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans - including Donald Trump - have made noises about further regulation of the platforms.</p><p>And yet, one of the most curious twists is that the tech industry, in this election cycle (and others, going back a decade), has overwhelmingly supported many of those most sharply proposing its regulation and break-up. </p><p>In 2020, Sanders and Warren feature consistently in the top three recipients (alongside Biden) of tech campaign contributions. Or at least, tech company employees and political action committees do, as companies do not make direct contributions.</p><h>Political donations</h><p> For example, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in the US (opensecrets.org), which tracks political donations, Facebook's $3.3 million in donations went to Democrats or Sanders, with Biden the top recipient, followed by Sanders, then Warren. Trump doesn't figure at all in the top 10.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet's top 10 recipients of $11 million in donations include Sanders and nine democrats. Biden is top, then Sanders, then Warren. Over 90 per cent of all donations went to Democrats. No Trump.</p><p>At Amazon ($5.2 million in donations), the top three recipients are Sanders, Biden, then Warren. Trump, the only Republican, comes in sixth. At Apple ($2.6 million), it's Sanders, Biden, then Warren, with Trump eighth. At Microsoft ($6.7 million) it's Biden, Sanders, then Warren, and Trump fifth (with just $74,000 vs Biden's $516,000). At Oracle ($1.78 million), it's Biden, Sanders and Warren, with Trump fourth.</p><p>The surprise of the batch is Palantir, whose top 10 includes eight Democrats (Biden at the top), two independents and zero Trump. Tesla features Sanders first, Biden second, and Trump seventh (with just $7,000). SpaceX has three Republicans in the top 10, but none is Trump, and has Sanders first, then Biden.</p><p>What does it mean? Well, it certainly highlights that tech employees - who skew young - are more left-leaning. More interestingly, it suggests employees are at the very least, comfortable with some candidates' strong anti-big tech rhetoric and policy proposals, diverging from their own employers' top management, an attitude which - alongside the proposed regulation and use of anti-trust laws by politicians - may significantly reshape technology companies in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4351236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T6-5N31-DYS1-002B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good to be with you. I'm Terrell Brown.</p><p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney wraps up his visit to Israel  this morning. Romney called Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and said he  was open to moving the U.S. embassy there, breaking a long-held U.S. policy  to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv. Israel is the second stop on a three- nation tour designed to strengthen his foreign policy credentials.  Yesterday, on FACE THE NATION, Romney told Jan Crawford his foreign policy  would be based on, quote, \"resolve, clarity, and confidence.\"</p><p>MITT ROMNEY (FACE THE NATION): I believe that as people will look at me,  they'll see a person who has dealt with a number of very difficult and  challenging circumstances and that I have been able to successfully  navigate through those and create greater strength and greater opportunity.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: We go to Susan McGuiness in Washington with more on Romney's  travels abroad. Susan, good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Hi. Good morning, Terrell. Well, before leaving Israel,  Romney stressed that keeping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons should be  this nation's highest national security priority. But he stopped short of  actually endorsing Israeli military action.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Mitt Romney is on his way to Poland. He'll try to invoke  the symbolism of the Cold War there. Romney is fresh off a trip to Israel,  where he placed a prayer on the Western Wall and met with Israeli leaders.  Sunday, Romney delivered a speech with tough talk aimed at Iran.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY: The regime in Iran is five years closer to developing nuclear  weapons capability. Preventing that outcome must be our highest national  security priority.</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a personal  friend of Romney, said the push for sanctions against Iran isn't working.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Israeli Prime Minister): All the sanctions and  diplomacy so far have not set back the Iranian program by one iota.</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: The White House maintains the sanctions are crippling  Iran's economy. President Obama has sent Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta  to Israel to meet with leaders there this week to reconfirm the strategy  regarding Iran.</p><p>LEON PANETTA (Secretary of Defense): When the United States, Israel, and  the international community remain unified in our position against Iran,  that's the best way to convince Iran to pull back from-- from what they are  doing.</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: In an interview with CBS's Jan Crawford, he left many  wondering if he agreed with an aide who hinted the governor would approve  of an Israeli military strike against Iran.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY (FACE THE NATION): Because I'm on foreign soil, I don't want to  be creating new foreign policy for-- for my country or in any way to  distance myself in the foreign policy of-- of our nation, but we respect  the right of a nation to defend itself.</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Romney says all options should be available if diplomatic  efforts fail.</p><p>Susan McGinnis, CBS News.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: And, also, in Israel with Romney, billionaire businessman  Sheldon Adelson, he-- he has promised to spend a hundred million dollars or  more to help defeat President Obama. Terrell.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Susan McGinnis in Washington for us this morning. Susan,  thank you so much.</p><p>The Democratic Party could announce as early as today that former President  Bill Clinton will play a significant role at the Democratic National  Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September. Mister Clinton will  formally nominate President Obama and make the case that Mister Obama has  the best economic vision for the country.</p><p>The presidential election is less than one hundred days away. The Federal  Election Commission reports nine single candidate Super PACs or Political  Action Committees have spent one hundred twenty-five million dollars. Super  PACs are allowed to spend unlimited sums raised from individuals,  companies, and unions. The pro-Romney Super PAC Restore Our Future spent  sixty million dollars. Two pro-President Obama PACs spent more than twenty- six million. At least twenty-one individuals or companies contributed one  million dollars or more to the pro-Romney campaign, eleven to pro-President  Obama.</p><p>James Holmes, the suspected gunman in the Colorado theatre massacre, is due  back in court today. Prosecutors are expected to read the more than one  hundred charges against the former doctoral student. Holmes is accused of  killing twelve people and injuring fifty-eight others during the July 28th  rampage and booby trapping his apartment with explosives.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>MAN: People versus James Holmes.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: James Holmes could face first-degree murder charges for each  of the twelve people who were killed inside the theater. But a former  prosecutor says Holmes probably won't face an additional homicide charge  after one of the wounded victims suffered a miscarriage. The family of  Ashley Moser says she lost her unborn child over the weekend, another deep  loss to her family after Moser's six-year-old daughter Veronica was killed  in the attack.</p><p>JAMISON TOEWS (Ashley Moser's Boyfriend): She came to one time and-- and  screamed where's my baby? I loved her for two years. I have helped raise  Veronica for two years and now they're gone.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: When Holmes appeared in court last week, he appeared drowsy  and inattentive, fuelling speculation that his defense may try to plead  insanity.</p><p>KAREN STEINHAUSER (Former Denver Prosecutor): This is going to be a case  where the focus is going to be on his mental state, his mental state during  this process and his mental state at the time that he committed these acts  and the time leading up to the commission of the acts.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Holmes was being treated by a psychiatrist at the University  of Colorado, Denver, where he was a student. Doctor Lynne Fenton was the  intended recipient of a package allegedly sent by Holmes to the school.  Sources say it included a letter in which Holmes' described shooting  people. Holmes' attorney say the discovery of the letter should have never  been made public because they, quote, \"...contain communications from  Mister Holmes to Doctor Fenton that Mister Holmes asserts are privileged.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: This morning there are some questions about Holmes'  psychiatrist. Records show Doctor Lynne Fenton was disciplined by the  Colorado Medical Board for prescribing drugs to her husband, a co-worker  and herself. Some of the shooting victims remain hospitalized this morning.  A fund for the victims grew to more than three million dollars over the  weekend.</p><p>Back overseas and what may be the decisive battle in the Syrian civil war,  the fight for Syria's biggest city Aleppo. Heavy fighting is reported there  this morning. Government forces are pounding the city to oust rebel  fighters. A U.N. official says two hundred thousand people have fled Aleppo  and that water and food are in short supply. Ines Ferre reports.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>INES FERRE: Demolished tanks and rubble littered the streets of Aleppo on  Sunday after Syrian troops pounded areas held by rebel forces. President  Bashar Assad's troops say they have recaptured parts of the country's  largest city. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Assad's latest  attack is proof that the government lacks the legitimacy to rule.</p><p>LEON PANETTA (Secretary of State): If they continue this kind of tragic  attack on their own people in Aleppo, I think it ultimately will be a nail  in Assad's coffin.</p><p>INES FERRE: Assad's regime had been struggling to maintain power over the  last two weeks after rebels made major advances in Syria's two largest  cities. But on Sunday, government forces declared victory in Damascus and  used heavy artillery and helicopters in Aleppo, a challenge for the rebels  many of who are poorly armed.</p><p>LEON PANETTA: The key right now is to continue to bring that pressure on  Syria, to provide assistance to the opposition and to provide whatever kind  of humanitarian aid we can.</p><p>INES FERRE: Despite the latest battle, both sides show little sign of  giving up.</p><p>Ines Ferre for CBS News.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Take a quick break on a Monday morning.</p><p>When we come back, big blackouts. Hundreds of millions are plunged into  darkness when one of India's power grids shuts down.</p><p>This is CBS MORNING NEWS.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: A weekend of heavy rain in northern China sent rivers over  their banks destroying roads, causing mudslides, flooding city streets, and  leaving hundreds of thousands of people without safe drinking water.  Chinese officials say nearly nine inches of rain fell across the region  since Friday.</p><p>In northern India this morning power is slowly being restored after a  massive Sunday blackout. Officials say more than three hundred million  people were left without electricity when the country's entire northern  power grid failed. The blackout affected India's capital New Delhi and shut  down commuter trains across the region.</p><p>CBS MoneyWatch time now on a Monday. Investors look for signs of hope from  the Fed. And cut-rate prices on Maine lobsters. Did it come out right?  Ashley Morrison here in New York with that and more. Ash, good morning.</p><p>ASHLEY MORRISON: I don't know, Fred, if it did.</p><p>Good morning, Terrell. Investors are holding out hope that the European  Central Bank takes action to guard against the continent's debt crisis.  That optimism led to a positive day in overseas trading. In Hong Kong, the  Hang Seng was up more than one percent while Japan's Nikkei added nearly  one percent.</p><p>Wall Street is hoping for big things when the Federal Reserve meets on  Wednesday. Most economists believe the central bank will announce new steps  to boost the fragile economy.</p><p>A strong finish on Friday sent stocks past a critical benchmark for the  week. The Dow added two hundred and fifty-three points. Most of that on  Friday to move past the thirteen-thousand mark. The NASDAQ gained thirty- two.</p><p>Federal air safety regulators have opened up an investigation into the  Boeing 787 Dreamliner. One of the jets had an engine problem that caused a  fire Saturday in South Carolina. The jet was undergoing pre-flight runway  testing when it happened. Boeing is betting big on the Dreamliner. It  finally delivered one of the jets last year after several years of delays.</p><p>And this might be the summer to splurge on lobster. Warm temperatures and  conservation measures have led to one of the strongest lobster harvest in  years. But the abundance of lobsters has driven down prices to a forty-year  low. Of course, not good news for the fishermen harvesting those lobsters,  but some pretty good news for those of us who like to eat them so.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: You like to eat them? That means, Ashley, you also have to  treat me to a lobster dinner soon.</p><p>ASHLEY MORRISON: That's what's for dinner.</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Thanks. It's coming up. Yep. Ashley Morrison here in New  York. Ashley, good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, your Monday morning weather.</p><p>And in sports, an American medalist in five Olympics shoots her way to  another gold medal and a Team USA record.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: --your national forecast. Scattered thunderstorms are will  range across much of the nation. Severe storms and heavy rain are most  likely from the upper Great Lakes to the Carolinas. The West Coast and the  Southern Plains will be dry. The heat will be on again from Kansas to North  Texas and in the Lower Mississippi Valley highs will be in the high  nineties and one hundreds.</p><p>In sports, a Sunday of thrills at the Olympics in London and a solid  showing for Team USA in basketball. Kevin Durant led the way with twenty- two points; LeBron James added eight assists in a 98-71 victory over  France. The U.S. faces Tunisia tomorrow in swimming. Dana Vollmer set a new  world record while taking the gold in the women's one hundred meter  butterfly. But the French staged an upset in 4 x 100 free-style relay,  winning the gold as the Americans settled for silver. That silver is the  seventeenth medal of Michael Phelps' career. He's just one away from tying  all-time record. So after the first full day of competition here is the  medal count. China leading the way with twelve total, including six gold.  The U.S. in second with eleven total, three gold. And Italy, South Korea,  and France round out the top five.</p><p>One member of Team USA deserves special mentioned. Kim Rhode won the gold  in women's skeet shooting Sunday. And in doing so she set a consecutive  medal record for American Olympians one dating back to 1996 when she was  still a teenager. Bigad Shaban has her story.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Shooter Kim Rhode wore a smile and her new gold medal after  accomplishing what no American ever has. She's the first to win medals at  five consecutive Olympic Games in a non-team sport.</p><p>KIM RHODE (Gold Medal Winner, Women's Skeet Shooting): It's just  overwhelming. It's just something that you're just like pinching yourself  like is this real? It's just incredible. It just seems like a dream.  There's just no words to describe it. I'm still kind of in shock.</p><p>Buck.</p><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Rhode is a California native who spends about eight hours a  day on the range pulling the trigger nearly a thousand times each practice.  We talked to Rhode in California just before she headed to London.</p><p>KIM RHODE: You know the nerves haven't kicked in yet.</p><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Winning her fifth medal was a different kind of challenge.  This time she had to use a new gun.</p><p>The one Rhode used most of her life and in a last four summer games was  stolen after the 2008 Olympics. Police recovered it a year later but by  then an anonymous donor from her hometown had already given her a new gun.</p><p>KIM RHODE: So many people have helped me get to this point. It wasn't  something I did on my own. And to have all of them here to see it just  makes me cry.</p><p>RICHARD RHODE (Kim's Father): Not bad, not bad.</p><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Her proud coach is also her father.</p><p>RICHARD RHODE: Oh, we're on cloud nine. I mean I can breathe now.</p><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Rhode was just seventeen when she scored her first medal and  took aim at breaking the Olympic record. Now, sixteen years later, she's  letting her hair down before taking aim at a possible sixth Olympic medal  on Saturday.</p><p>Bigad Shaban, CBS News, London.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: I ain't messing with her, telling you.</p><p>When we come back, no heart, no soul, but what a lifesaver. The robot that  makes a world of difference to someone struggling to make it through the  day.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Top stories now on a Monday.</p><p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney leaves Israel for Poland this  morning. The third stop of a three-nation visit. In Israel Romney had harsh  words for Iran and said he respected Israel's right to protect itself.</p><p>And James Holmes, the suspected gunman in the Colorado shooting spree, is  expected to be arraigned this morning. Holmes is accused of killing twelve  people and injuring several others.</p><p>In the brave new world of 2012 robots are able to clean houses, assemble  products in factories, and even do surgery. Now, scientists have designed a  model to do something, some simple things that many of us, otherwise, take  for granted. Priya Clemens reports.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>LEILA TAKAYAMA: Close your right hand.</p><p>MAN (Automated voice): Closing right hand.</p><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: In a lab deep in Silicon Valley robots are being programmed  to do household chores like folding laundry and sorting socks.</p><p>LEILA TAKAYAMA: I think the robotic technology is awesome.</p><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: Leila Takayama worked at Willow Garage, a company that  designs and tests personal robots--making them less intimidating--</p><p>I'm never been hugged by a robot before, oh.</p><p>--and more practical. But it's not housework that's placing these robots on  the cutting edge. It's what they've done for people like Henry Evans, who  at the age of forty suffered a severe stroke. It left him a quadriplegic,  able to understand, unable to speak. Evans' wife Jane:</p><p>JANE EVANS: I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know. He was  literally trapped in his body.</p><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: But Evans recently became one of the first to test a  personal robot donated by Willow Garage to a team of scientists at Georgia  Tech.</p><p>With eye movements and his limited use of one finger, Evans can program the  robot to help him shave, help him scratch and to get a towel. It all takes  a lot of work and time for this clunky four-hundred-pound machine.</p><p>Why not just hire someone to help Henry as opposed to having a computer  help him?</p><p>CHARLIE KEMP (Georgia Institute of Technology): It's the difference between  asking someone to do it for you versus doing it for yourself.</p><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: For Henry doing anything independently was once unthinkable.</p><p>JANE EVANS: When you see that sense of satisfaction in his face, I mean  there's no words to describe it. It's amazing. I love the robot. The robot  has helped my husband emerge into this person that I never dreamed  possible.</p><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: And opening up a world of endless possibilities.</p><p>Priya Clemens, CBS News, Menlo Park, California.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Oh, boy, modern technology.</p><p>Coming up after your local news on CBS THIS MORNING, how the next big tech  idea may come from a floating city.</p><p>I'm Terrell Brown. This is the CBS MORNING NEWS.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Storm damage is still being assessed in Elmira, New York, in  the aftermath of last week's tornado. At least sixteen homes were left  unlivable. As Mark Strassmann reports tougher construction standards could  cut down on the destruction from severe weather.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>MIKE HALLOWELL (Lowe's Manager): This was kind of the aisle that we all  went down.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Mike Hallowell manages the Lowe's in Sanford, North  Carolina, rebuilt after a tornado's direct hit leveled the store last year.</p><p>MAN (YouTube): All right. Everyone out this way.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: The EF3 tornado packing winds of one hundred sixty-five  miles per hour collapsed the building's facade and three-fourths of its  roof. One hundred customers and employees sprinted for cover. No one was  killed.</p><p>MIKE HALLOWELL: When I was right about this area right now you know I was  looking back and the roof was literally peeling off behind me.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: That disaster was another example of the need for  construction standards that can stand up to severe weather. Watch this test  in a South Carolina research hangar. Two commercial buildings are battered  by one hundred fans blowing one-hundred-thirty-five-mile-per-hour winds  equal to a Category 2 hurricane. The building on the left, common in  America's strip malls, collapses. The one on the right, with identical  materials but built to higher wind resistant standards holds up.</p><p>JULIE ROCHMAN (President and CEO, IBHS): Make it strong.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Julie Rochman is CEO of the Insurance Institute for  Business and Home Safety. She says Hurricane Andrew's 1992 strike on South  Florida, a twenty-six-billion-dollar disaster was a wake-up call.</p><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: When Andrew came along and threw roofs back and opened  buildings up we could actually see how those buildings failed. Very vividly  we see-- we could see how straps weren't connected. Things that had gone  wrong because there was nobody enforcing the codes.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: The institute recently rated building codes in eighteen  hurricane-prone states from Texas to Maine. Florida and Virginia earned the  highest scores in the nineties out of one hundred. Mississippi, the lowest,  four out of one hundred.</p><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: A lot of these states do not have statewide building codes.  In some places the contractors who do work on your home aren't even  licensed.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Rochman says higher construction standards cost relatively  little. On average five percent more in construction costs.</p><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: Not a lot more money, a lot more safety.</p><p>MIKE HALLOWELL: How are we doing today?</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Rebuilding Mike Hallowell's store cost Lowe's ten million  dollars but among all businesses closed by a natural disaster one quarter  never reopen their doors.</p><p>Mark Strassmann, CBS News, Atlanta.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TERRELL BROWN: Coming up after your local news on CBS THIS MORNING, the  latest on suspected Aurora, Colorado, gunman James Holmes. He's scheduled  to be arraigned today.</p><p>Plus, CBS News discovers amazing new information about President Obama's  already diverse family background.</p><p>And Anderson Cooper asked Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps about his decision  to return for the London Games.</p><p>That and more a little later on CBS THIS MORNING.</p><p>For now, though, that is the CBS MORNING NEWS for this Monday. As always,  appreciate you watching.</p><p>I'm Terrell Brown. Take care, everybody. Have a great day.</p><p>END    </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming Copyright MMXII CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Good to be with you. I'm Terrell Brown.</p><p/><p>Republican presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>wraps up his visit to Israel this morning. Romney called Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and said he was open to moving the U.S. embassy there, breaking a long-held U.S. policy to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv. Israel is the second stop on a three- nation tour designed to strengthen his foreign policy credentials. Yesterday, on FACE THE NATION, Romney told Jan Crawford his foreign policy would be based on, quote, \"resolve, clarity, and confidence.\"</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(FACE THE NATION): I believe that as people will look at me, they'll see a person who has dealt with a number of very difficult and challenging circumstances and that I have been able to successfully navigate through those and create greater strength and greater opportunity.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: We go to Susan McGuiness in Washington with more on Romney's travels abroad. Susan, good morning to you.</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Hi. Good morning, Terrell. Well, before leaving Israel, Romney stressed that keeping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons should be this nation's highest national security priority. But he stopped short of actually endorsing Israeli military action.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is on his way to Poland. He'll try to invoke the symbolism of the Cold War there. Romney is fresh off a trip to Israel, where he placed a prayer on the Western Wall and met with Israeli leaders. Sunday, Romney delivered a speech with tough talk aimed at Iran.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY</nameText></person>: The regime in Iran is five years closer to developing nuclear weapons capability. Preventing that outcome must be our highest national security priority.</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a personal friend of Romney, said the push for sanctions against Iran isn't working.</p><p/><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Israeli Prime Minister): All the sanctions and diplomacy so far have not set back the Iranian program by one iota.</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: The White House maintains the sanctions are crippling Iran's economy. President Obama has sent Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta to Israel to meet with leaders there this week to reconfirm the strategy regarding Iran.</p><p/><p>LEON PANETTA (Secretary of Defense): When the United States, Israel, and the international community remain unified in our position against Iran, that's the best way to convince Iran to pull back from-- from what they are doing.</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: In an interview with CBS's Jan Crawford, he left many wondering if he agreed with an aide who hinted the governor would approve of an Israeli military strike against Iran.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(FACE THE NATION): Because I'm on foreign soil, I don't want to be creating new foreign policy for-- for my country or in any way to distance myself in the foreign policy of-- of our nation, but we respect the right of a nation to defend itself.</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: Romney says all options should be available if diplomatic efforts fail.</p><p/><p>Susan McGinnis, CBS News.</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>SUSAN MCGINNIS: And, also, in Israel with Romney, billionaire businessman Sheldon Adelson, he-- he has promised to spend a hundred million dollars or more to help defeat President Obama. Terrell.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Susan McGinnis in Washington for us this morning. Susan, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>The Democratic Party could announce as early as today that former President Bill Clinton will play a significant role at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September. Mister Clinton will formally nominate President Obama and make the case that Mister Obama has the best economic vision for the country.</p><p/><p>The presidential election is less than one hundred days away. The Federal Election Commission reports nine single candidate Super PACs or Political Action Committees have spent one hundred twenty-five million dollars. Super PACs are allowed to spend unlimited sums raised from individuals, companies, and unions. The pro-Romney Super PAC Restore Our Future spent sixty million dollars. Two pro-President Obama PACs spent more than twenty- six million. At least twenty-one individuals or companies contributed one million dollars or more to the pro-Romney campaign, eleven to pro-President Obama.</p><p/><p>James Holmes, the suspected gunman in the Colorado theatre massacre, is due back in court today. Prosecutors are expected to read the more than one hundred charges against the former doctoral student. Holmes is accused of killing twelve people and injuring fifty-eight others during the July 28th rampage and booby trapping his apartment with explosives.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>MAN: People versus James Holmes.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: James Holmes could face first-degree murder charges for each of the twelve people who were killed inside the theater. But a former prosecutor says Holmes probably won't face an additional homicide charge after one of the wounded victims suffered a miscarriage. The family of Ashley Moser says she lost her unborn child over the weekend, another deep loss to her family after Moser's six-year-old daughter Veronica was killed in the attack.</p><p/><p>JAMISON TOEWS (Ashley Moser's Boyfriend): She came to one time and-- and screamed where's my baby? I loved her for two years. I have helped raise Veronica for two years and now they're gone.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: When Holmes appeared in court last week, he appeared drowsy and inattentive, fuelling speculation that his defense may try to plead insanity.</p><p/><p>KAREN STEINHAUSER (Former Denver Prosecutor): This is going to be a case where the focus is going to be on his mental state, his mental state during this process and his mental state at the time that he committed these acts and the time leading up to the commission of the acts.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Holmes was being treated by a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado, Denver, where he was a student. Doctor Lynne Fenton was the intended recipient of a package allegedly sent by Holmes to the school. Sources say it included a letter in which Holmes' described shooting people. Holmes' attorney say the discovery of the letter should have never been made public because they, quote, \"...contain communications from Mister Holmes to Doctor Fenton that Mister Holmes asserts are privileged.\"</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: This morning there are some questions about Holmes' psychiatrist. Records show Doctor Lynne Fenton was disciplined by the Colorado Medical Board for prescribing drugs to her husband, a co-worker and herself. Some of the shooting victims remain hospitalized this morning. A fund for the victims grew to more than three million dollars over the weekend.</p><p/><p>Back overseas and what may be the decisive battle in the Syrian civil war, the fight for Syria's biggest city Aleppo. Heavy fighting is reported there this morning. Government forces are pounding the city to oust rebel fighters. A U.N. official says two hundred thousand people have fled Aleppo and that water and food are in short supply. Ines Ferre reports.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>INES FERRE: Demolished tanks and rubble littered the streets of Aleppo on Sunday after Syrian troops pounded areas held by rebel forces. President Bashar Assad's troops say they have recaptured parts of the country's largest city. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Assad's latest attack is proof that the government lacks the legitimacy to rule.</p><p/><p>LEON PANETTA (Secretary of State): If they continue this kind of tragic attack on their own people in Aleppo, I think it ultimately will be a nail in Assad's coffin.</p><p/><p>INES FERRE: Assad's regime had been struggling to maintain power over the last two weeks after rebels made major advances in Syria's two largest cities. But on Sunday, government forces declared victory in Damascus and used heavy artillery and helicopters in Aleppo, a challenge for the rebels many of who are poorly armed.</p><p/><p>LEON PANETTA: The key right now is to continue to bring that pressure on Syria, to provide assistance to the opposition and to provide whatever kind of humanitarian aid we can.</p><p/><p>INES FERRE: Despite the latest battle, both sides show little sign of giving up.</p><p/><p>Ines Ferre for CBS News.</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Take a quick break on a Monday morning.</p><p/><p>When we come back, big blackouts. Hundreds of millions are plunged into darkness when one of India's power grids shuts down.</p><p/><p>This is CBS MORNING NEWS.</p><p/><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: A weekend of heavy rain in northern China sent rivers over their banks destroying roads, causing mudslides, flooding city streets, and leaving hundreds of thousands of people without safe drinking water. Chinese officials say nearly nine inches of rain fell across the region since Friday.</p><p/><p>In northern India this morning power is slowly being restored after a massive Sunday blackout. Officials say more than three hundred million people were left without electricity when the country's entire northern power grid failed. The blackout affected India's capital New Delhi and shut down commuter trains across the region.</p><p/><p>CBS MoneyWatch time now on a Monday. Investors look for signs of hope from the Fed. And cut-rate prices on Maine lobsters. Did it come out right? Ashley Morrison here in New York with that and more. Ash, good morning.</p><p/><p>ASHLEY MORRISON: I don't know, Fred, if it did.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Terrell. Investors are holding out hope that the European Central Bank takes action to guard against the continent's debt crisis. That optimism led to a positive day in overseas trading. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng was up more than one percent while Japan's Nikkei added nearly one percent.</p><p/><p>Wall Street is hoping for big things when the Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday. Most economists believe the central bank will announce new steps to boost the fragile economy.</p><p/><p>A strong finish on Friday sent stocks past a critical benchmark for the week. The Dow added two hundred and fifty-three points. Most of that on Friday to move past the thirteen-thousand mark. The NASDAQ gained thirty- two.</p><p/><p>Federal air safety regulators have opened up an investigation into the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. One of the jets had an engine problem that caused a fire Saturday in South Carolina. The jet was undergoing pre-flight runway testing when it happened. Boeing is betting big on the Dreamliner. It finally delivered one of the jets last year after several years of delays.</p><p/><p>And this might be the summer to splurge on lobster. Warm temperatures and conservation measures have led to one of the strongest lobster harvest in years. But the abundance of lobsters has driven down prices to a forty-year low. Of course, not good news for the fishermen harvesting those lobsters, but some pretty good news for those of us who like to eat them so.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: You like to eat them? That means, Ashley, you also have to treat me to a lobster dinner soon.</p><p/><p>ASHLEY MORRISON: That's what's for dinner.</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Thanks. It's coming up. Yep. Ashley Morrison here in New York. Ashley, good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Coming up next, your Monday morning weather.</p><p/><p>And in sports, an American medalist in five Olympics shoots her way to another gold medal and a Team USA record.</p><p/><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: --your national forecast. Scattered thunderstorms are will range across much of the nation. Severe storms and heavy rain are most likely from the upper Great Lakes to the Carolinas. The West Coast and the Southern Plains will be dry. The heat will be on again from Kansas to North Texas and in the Lower Mississippi Valley highs will be in the high nineties and one hundreds.</p><p/><p>In sports, a Sunday of thrills at the Olympics in London and a solid showing for Team USA in basketball. Kevin Durant led the way with twenty- two points; LeBron James added eight assists in a 98-71 victory over France. The U.S. faces Tunisia tomorrow in swimming. Dana Vollmer set a new world record while taking the gold in the women's one hundred meter butterfly. But the French staged an upset in 4 x 100 free-style relay, winning the gold as the Americans settled for silver. That silver is the seventeenth medal of Michael Phelps' career. He's just one away from tying all-time record. So after the first full day of competition here is the medal count. China leading the way with twelve total, including six gold. The U.S. in second with eleven total, three gold. And Italy, South Korea, and France round out the top five.</p><p/><p>One member of Team USA deserves special mentioned. Kim Rhode won the gold in women's skeet shooting Sunday. And in doing so she set a consecutive medal record for American Olympians one dating back to 1996 when she was still a teenager. Bigad Shaban has her story.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Shooter Kim Rhode wore a smile and her new gold medal after accomplishing what no American ever has. She's the first to win medals at five consecutive Olympic Games in a non-team sport.</p><p/><p>KIM RHODE (Gold Medal Winner, Women's Skeet Shooting): It's just overwhelming. It's just something that you're just like pinching yourself like is this real? It's just incredible. It just seems like a dream. There's just no words to describe it. I'm still kind of in shock.</p><p/><p>Buck.</p><p/><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Rhode is a California native who spends about eight hours a day on the range pulling the trigger nearly a thousand times each practice. We talked to Rhode in California just before she headed to London.</p><p/><p>KIM RHODE: You know the nerves haven't kicked in yet.</p><p/><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Winning her fifth medal was a different kind of challenge. This time she had to use a new gun.</p><p/><p>The one Rhode used most of her life and in a last four summer games was stolen after the 2008 Olympics. Police recovered it a year later but by then an anonymous donor from her hometown had already given her a new gun.</p><p/><p>KIM RHODE: So many people have helped me get to this point. It wasn't something I did on my own. And to have all of them here to see it just makes me cry.</p><p/><p>RICHARD RHODE (Kim's Father): Not bad, not bad.</p><p/><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Her proud coach is also her father.</p><p/><p>RICHARD RHODE: Oh, we're on cloud nine. I mean I can breathe now.</p><p/><p>BIGAD SHABAN: Rhode was just seventeen when she scored her first medal and took aim at breaking the Olympic record. Now, sixteen years later, she's letting her hair down before taking aim at a possible sixth Olympic medal on Saturday.</p><p/><p>Bigad Shaban, CBS News, London.</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: I ain't messing with her, telling you.</p><p/><p>When we come back, no heart, no soul, but what a lifesaver. The robot that makes a world of difference to someone struggling to make it through the day.</p><p/><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Top stories now on a Monday.</p><p/><p>Republican presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>leaves Israel for Poland this morning. The third stop of a three-nation visit. In Israel Romney had harsh words for Iran and said he respected Israel's right to protect itself.</p><p/><p>And James Holmes, the suspected gunman in the Colorado shooting spree, is expected to be arraigned this morning. Holmes is accused of killing twelve people and injuring several others.</p><p/><p>In the brave new world of 2012 robots are able to clean houses, assemble products in factories, and even do surgery. Now, scientists have designed a model to do something, some simple things that many of us, otherwise, take for granted. Priya Clemens reports.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>LEILA TAKAYAMA: Close your right hand.</p><p/><p>MAN (Automated voice): Closing right hand.</p><p/><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: In a lab deep in Silicon Valley robots are being programmed to do household chores like folding laundry and sorting socks.</p><p/><p>LEILA TAKAYAMA: I think the robotic technology is awesome.</p><p/><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: Leila Takayama worked at Willow Garage, a company that designs and tests personal robots--making them less intimidating--</p><p/><p>I'm never been hugged by a robot before, oh.</p><p/><p>--and more practical. But it's not housework that's placing these robots on the cutting edge. It's what they've done for people like Henry Evans, who at the age of forty suffered a severe stroke. It left him a quadriplegic, able to understand, unable to speak. Evans' wife Jane:</p><p/><p>JANE EVANS: I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know. He was literally trapped in his body.</p><p/><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: But Evans recently became one of the first to test a personal robot donated by Willow Garage to a team of scientists at Georgia Tech.</p><p/><p>With eye movements and his limited use of one finger, Evans can program the robot to help him shave, help him scratch and to get a towel. It all takes a lot of work and time for this clunky four-hundred-pound machine.</p><p/><p>Why not just hire someone to help Henry as opposed to having a computer help him?</p><p/><p>CHARLIE KEMP (Georgia Institute of Technology): It's the difference between asking someone to do it for you versus doing it for yourself.</p><p/><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: For Henry doing anything independently was once unthinkable.</p><p/><p>JANE EVANS: When you see that sense of satisfaction in his face, I mean there's no words to describe it. It's amazing. I love the robot. The robot has helped my husband emerge into this person that I never dreamed possible.</p><p/><p>PRIYA CLEMENS: And opening up a world of endless possibilities.</p><p/><p>Priya Clemens, CBS News, Menlo Park, California.</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Oh, boy, modern technology.</p><p/><p>Coming up after your local news on CBS THIS MORNING, how the next big tech idea may come from a floating city.</p><p/><p>I'm Terrell Brown. This is the CBS MORNING NEWS.</p><p/><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Storm damage is still being assessed in Elmira, New York, in the aftermath of last week's tornado. At least sixteen homes were left unlivable. As Mark Strassmann reports tougher construction standards could cut down on the destruction from severe weather.</p><p/><p>(Begin VT)</p><p/><p>MIKE HALLOWELL (Lowe's Manager): This was kind of the aisle that we all went down.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Mike Hallowell manages the Lowe's in Sanford, North Carolina, rebuilt after a tornado's direct hit leveled the store last year.</p><p/><p>MAN (YouTube): All right. Everyone out this way.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: The EF3 tornado packing winds of one hundred sixty-five miles per hour collapsed the building's facade and three-fourths of its roof. One hundred customers and employees sprinted for cover. No one was killed.</p><p/><p>MIKE HALLOWELL: When I was right about this area right now you know I was looking back and the roof was literally peeling off behind me.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: That disaster was another example of the need for construction standards that can stand up to severe weather. Watch this test in a South Carolina research hangar. Two commercial buildings are battered by one hundred fans blowing one-hundred-thirty-five-mile-per-hour winds equal to a Category 2 hurricane. The building on the left, common in America's strip malls, collapses. The one on the right, with identical materials but built to higher wind resistant standards holds up.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROCHMAN (President and CEO, IBHS): Make it strong.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Julie Rochman is CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety. She says Hurricane Andrew's 1992 strike on South Florida, a twenty-six-billion-dollar disaster was a wake-up call.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: When Andrew came along and threw roofs back and opened buildings up we could actually see how those buildings failed. Very vividly we see-- we could see how straps weren't connected. Things that had gone wrong because there was nobody enforcing the codes.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: The institute recently rated building codes in eighteen hurricane-prone states from Texas to Maine. Florida and Virginia earned the highest scores in the nineties out of one hundred. Mississippi, the lowest, four out of one hundred.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: A lot of these states do not have statewide building codes. In some places the contractors who do work on your home aren't even licensed.</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Rochman says higher construction standards cost relatively little. On average five percent more in construction costs.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROCHMAN: Not a lot more money, a lot more safety.</p><p/><p>MIKE HALLOWELL: How are we doing today?</p><p/><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Rebuilding Mike Hallowell's store cost Lowe's ten million dollars but among all businesses closed by a natural disaster one quarter never reopen their doors.</p><p/><p>Mark Strassmann, CBS News, Atlanta.</p><p/><p>(End VT)</p><p/><p>TERRELL BROWN: Coming up after your local news on CBS THIS MORNING, the latest on suspected Aurora, Colorado, gunman James Holmes. He's scheduled to be arraigned today.</p><p/><p>Plus, CBS News discovers amazing new information about President Obama's already diverse family background.</p><p/><p>And Anderson Cooper asked Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps about his decision to return for the London Games.</p><p/><p>That and more a little later on CBS THIS MORNING.</p><p/><p>For now, though, that is the CBS MORNING NEWS for this Monday. As always, appreciate you watching.</p><p/><p>I'm Terrell Brown. Take care, everybody. Have a great day.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and programming Copyright MMXII CBS Broadcasting Inc.
