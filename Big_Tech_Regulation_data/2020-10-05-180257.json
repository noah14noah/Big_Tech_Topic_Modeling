We'll talk to Power America's Jack Kemp. And as U.S. diplomats prepare to sit down with the Chinese, is it time for payback?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Chris Matthews. Let's play HARDBALL.</p><p>Well, it's hardly the first big tech company to announce bad news, but today all the talk on Wall Street and out in Silicon Valley was about Cisco Systems. Long considered a blue chip of the new economy, Cisco's networking equipment is the foundation for much of the Internet. But yesterday, the company announced its sales this quarter could be down 30 percent and it will lay off over 8,000 workers. Over the past year, Cisco's stock has lost 80 percent of its value. The company's CEO, John Chambers, told reporters, \"This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated. We never built models to anticipate something of this magnitude.\"</p><p>But last night on CNBC, he held out hope for the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: I'm still very optimistic about the industry as a whole. We're still very tightly tied to economies and capital spending globally. If somebody can tell us that those are going to be positive, then I'm very comfortable with the 30 to 50 percent growth. If those continue to be very challenging, then obviously we cannot avoid capital spending challenges and will affect our earnings appropriately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: So which is it? Is this going to be a quick and dirty recession or a deep slump? We'll talk to Stephen Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, Tony Perkins of Red Herring and Jack Kemp of Empower America. And we'll look ahead to tomorrow's meeting between the U.S. and the Chinese military. What's at stake as the two sides come face to face?</p><p>We begin tonight with CNBC's Bill Griffeth. Bill, what is the reaction on Wall Street to what was said today by John Chambers of Cisco?</p><p>BILL GRIFFETH, CNBC CORRESPONDENT: You know, Chris, for a long time in the '90s the analysts on Wall Street said that the stock market had already priced in perfection, that a lot of companies like a Cisco needed to continue with the breakneck pace of growth that they had experienced through much of the '90s. And now the feeling seems to be that the stock market is starting to price in, what shall we say, Armageddon, I mean, you know, something a lot worse than what we've seen the last several years and today on Wall Street for the most part they, I won't say that they took the Cisco warning in stride, but we didn't see a major decline on that company's stock. When all was said and done it was only down about $<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.50 in normal trade today, and as you can see there, the major averages on Wall Street actually finished higher and, in fact, tonight from other big companies like Intel and Texas Instruments, we're getting some numbers that suggest that maybe things aren't as bad they would suggest from Cisco.</emphasis></p><p>But the point is, I mean you heard John Chambers say he's still expecting growth of between 30 and 50 percent. That's a lot less than they did in the '90s, but it's still a growth rate that would make any CEO's mouth water. So, you know, they're still growing, but just not as fast as they were back in the '90s.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, you know, Bill, you cover business and I come from a political background, so there's such a word as spin.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You bet.</p><p>MATTHEWS: There's also a word called low balling.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yup, yup.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Are these guys low balling? People, including Jack Welch, are all these guys out there telling us the bad news to make the, to lower the bench or the marker for what they have to accomplish in each corporation?</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, on any given quarter there may be a bit of that. But when you take it in the aggregate over, you know, a year over year or a two year period, five year period, there's not a whole lot of spin you can do. The numbers don't lie from that standpoint. And, you know, what you're seeing right now, I mean it's all about expectations on Wall Street.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the expectations were very high for a long time and what we're seeing right now is just a matter of expectations perhaps coming back down to a more realistic level. And for Cisco Systems, I mean a Cisco, you know, an Intel, an AOL, I mean a lot of these high fliers, Yahoo! from the '90s and the growth of the Internet, the expectations were just too high. And now we're starting to see that come down to maybe more realistic levels here.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Good to see you again, Bill Griffeth of CNBC.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks, Christopher.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL.</p><p>We're joined now from New York by Stephen Roach. He's chief global economist at Morgan Stanley. And from San Francisco, our old pal Tony Perkins of Red Herring Communications.</p><p>I want to start first with Mr. Roach, a newcomer to the program. Thank you. You're a very prestigious fellow. I've got to ask you the simple question, is the new economy playing by the old rules now but they just didn't know it?</p><p>STEPHEN ROACH, MORGAN STANLEY: Absolutely, Chris. I think the new economy went to excess just like the Nasdaq did a year ago and that excess showed up in the form of too many workers that were hired, especially white collar workers, and unfortunately too much capital spending, largely technology. And this recession is all about taking that excess out and it's going to take a while.</p><p>MATTHEWS: There was a lot of people talking a or so ago saying you don't have to worry about quarterly profits anymore, that's yesterday's thinking. All you have to do is brand your product. All you've got to do is get everybody to know that you're Amazon.com and the money is going to come in eventually because we're not going to have any more recessions.</p><p>ROACH: That was the hype, that was the hope of the new economy. The mantra was scale and scope and it worked well as long as we stayed in this hyper growth path that we were on over the 1995 to mid 2000 period. That boom has gone to bust and we've found we've got too much cost in the system. We're in a deep earnings recession and we've got to take those costs out now.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Who won and who lost in this big bubble pop here? Did the young gung ho guys who are in their early '30s or even younger who made all these things happen in high tech, did they make off with a bundle of money and the people who were the stooges the ones who invested?</p><p>ROACH: Hard to know the winners and losers. Clearly, the investors who were early in getting in and early in getting out are huge winners and those that hung on for too long, as is usually the case in a bubble, they're the painful losers.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let's get another point of view from our friend Tony Perkins. React to what you just heard critically.</p><p>TONY PERKINS, \"RED HERRING\": Well, I have always been in line with Stephen Roach. In fact, he was quoted amply in my book, \"Internet Bubble,\" which came out in '99. We both were not huge believers in this new economy hype. You talk about spin, Chris, I think John Chambers is doing a little bit of a disservice to our industry. He's spinning the fact that, as Stephen is indicating, he mismanaged his company. He hired too many people, bought too much inventory. He drank the Internet Kool-Aid just like everybody else. He should be apologizing and cutting out the costs, just as Mr. Roach is suggesting he should do.</p><p>MATTHEWS: What about the business cycle, Tony? Do you believe in it? Is it here to stay? It's been here, I was just, we're going to be talking with Jack Kemp, but the facts are there. We've had a recession under Reagan when he first came in. We've had a recession under Bush one. We're having a recession, it looks like now, under Bush two. Why don't we acknowledge the fact that recessions are part of life?</p><p>PERKINS: They are part of life. We saw an extended boom which, again, was artificially extended because we saw literally hundreds of billions of dollars from V.C.s and the public markets going into these Internet companies that turned out not to be real. But unfortunately for the Ciscos, they bought a bunch of equipment from them artificially inflating their revenue line and now we're in a hangover period. The day of reckoning is here. We should just all admit that we all got sucked into this thing and it's time to go back and running our businesses the way that we should.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, let's talk about that right now with Stephen Roach. In terms of people out there who are watching who are investors and people who may be venture capitalists even, a bunch of them watching right now, I'm sure they are, what should they be doing?</p><p>ROACH: I think they have to be very, very cautious, Chris. The market has, as you indicated at the outset, taken on board an awful lot of bad news. But the problem is that while the market has capitulated, as Bill Griffeth said, on the outlook for this year, it's still too optimistic for next year. Earnings are expected to be up about 16 percent next year. In my opinion, there's no way corporate America is going to hit that.</p><p>So I think investors need to stay very defensive, avoiding high risk technology bets at this point, and playing a lot of defensive consumer stocks and possibly even bonds. This is not a time to go back in\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: That's the choice. That's the choice that was presented on the front page of \"USA Today.\" If you think there's going to be a quick rebound, put your money on stocks to do well in rebounds. If you don't, if you think we're going into a deep trough for a year or so, put your money in those defensive stocks like, and they mentioned cereals, utilities, things like that.</p><p>ROACH: I couldn't agree more.</p><p>MATTHEWS: What do you think, Tony?</p><p>PERKINS: Well, I would\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, you want people to invest in high tech. I mean you've got an interest here, right? Let's be honest. You love this field. It's your field.</p><p>PERKINS: Well, the fact of the matter is is Larry Lindsey, the chief economic adviser, reminded me when I interviewed him last week in the White House that the average investment in I.T. still will get a 30 to 40 percent return on your investment. Michael Dell recently bragged to me that he gets a 250 percent return every time he invests in new computers and new software and the Internet\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: But that's not the stock, that's not the stock buyer. That's the entrepreneur, right?</p><p>PERKINS: Yeah, that's to help companies become more efficient. And if that's the case, there's going to continue to be strong demand for technology goods. I think John Chambers is admitting that once we get through this kind of recalibration period that we'll be back to good growth.</p><p>So, you know, long-term I'm optimistic. Larry Lindsey says it's going to be a great decade for technology. I agree with him. It's just that we've got to get through this next several quarters.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, we've got Jack Kemp coming up in the next section and he's going to be great talking about tax cuts. No surprise there. What do you folks both think, starting with you, Stephen? What do you think would be the best news to come out of Washington? You're up in New York. What do you want to read in the \"New York Times\" tomorrow morning, the next morning, coming out of the Congress or the president in terms of turning the economy back around?</p><p>ROACH: Well, I think a tax cut would help. It's got to be more front loaded than back loaded. It's got to be directed at spenders, not savers. And\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: So you want a Democrat tax cut?</p><p>ROACH: No, I don't want to label it, Chris.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I know you can't\u2026</p><p>ROACH: I just would like, you know\u2026</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: Well, what they want is an across-the-board sort of cash amount, a couple hundred bucks to every man, woman and child in the country, no matter if they don't even pay taxes, and they want it fast. Fast money. It's like everybody goes to their ATM machine and punches $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">200 and they get it. That's what they're basically offering. As opposed to the Republicans, who want to pay back people who've paid in themselves. The big taxpayers get back big tax cuts down the road. What's the better proposal here?</emphasis></p><p>ROACH: Do we want, do we want, you know, structural reform of the tax system or do we want to jump start the economy? That's the decision we've got to make. Two different packages for two different problems. My guess is that an economy in recession needs a very different tax cut than the one that's working its way through Congress right now.</p><p>MATTHEWS: So you want the every man a king approach?</p><p>ROACH: Call it what you want. I think we need spending.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: OK, let's go. What do you think, Tony, is that right? ATM machines, you punch $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">200, you get it back, everybody gets it?</emphasis></p><p>PERKINS: Well, that would be a good start. But as I've argued, as you know, Chris, on this show, that the so-called rich people that the Democrats don't want to give their money back to are the investors, the angel investors, the venture people, the people who give the average guy coming off the street with an idea the chance to build his dream.</p><p>So I would just per se like to see a simpler, flatter tax for everybody. It would be great if we could all get a rebate. I know I just paid the biggest tax bill I've ever paid. I wouldn't mind having a few of those dollars back myself. But it's clearly all hands on deck time -- cut taxes, get the budget in order, cut interest rates, everybody's got to go back to work.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, we're going to have lower interest rates because Jack Kemp's going to call for them. The Fed may not deliver. Let me get to that question of the Federal Reserve, because all this talk about tax policy is so slow moving, fiscal policy is historically lagging in every regard in terms of getting things done.</p><p>The Federal Reserve chairman has been battling inflation. He's one of the most famous men in the world because he successfully battled inflation. Is he wrong-minded? Is he blind-sided? There we have him walking to work there at the Fed. Stephen, is he wrong-headed right now to be fighting inflation when there is none?</p><p>ROACH: He's won the war, Chris, so it's time to sort of face a different reality. We have just seen the greatest financial bubble in modern history pop. The Fed chairman, with all due respect, doesn't even admit that we had a financial bubble. Inflation is not the risk. Excess capacity and the aftershocks in the real economy are. He's got to take interest rates down a lot more than he's been doing.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Why is there no inflationary threat? Why is he wrong? Because there usually is. Why is there none now? Is it because of productivity as he or others have suggested? We don't face that threat?</p><p>ROACH: It has nothing to do with productivity. It just has to do with the globalization of capacity and the fact that demand is weakening well below the supply curve so no company has pricing leverage in this economy. Any cost pressures show up in reduced earnings or profit margins and that takes the stock market down.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>ROACH: It's a different paradigm.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Tony, the prescription here is lower interest rates, a fast tax cut for everybody. You just pass out the money as fast as you can, a couple hundred bucks a person. Anything else? And free trade. And what else?</p><p>PERKINS: Well, again, I think there's a lot of pressure on the back of the John Chambers' of the world to just be humble, to understand that they lived in a period of excess. They countered a lot of revenues as permanent that were one time revenues. And so again, it's all hands on deck, got to run our businesses better and live up to\u2026</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: How -- Tony, you know all these people. How does a person's lifestyle change when they realize they only own $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">500 million instead of $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2 billion? How do they change their way of living? I'm curious.</emphasis></p><p>PERKINS: Well, what we've seen in Silicon Valley is a lot of homes aren't getting built that thought they were going to get built. A lot of people are walking away from downpayments. A lot of people are selling their cars. I mean, again, it's back to reality. We all lived in the Internet distortion field and it was a fun lie, as the Grateful Dead would say. But we're back here in\u2026</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: But remember the late '20s, we read about people jumping out of windows and lives changing dramatically for the worse? It doesn't sound like that's happening. It seems to me the losers here are the little people out there who invested in the stock market believing in the bubble, but the geniuses behind the bubble are doing OK. As I said, $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2 billion down to $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">500 million ain't so bad, is it?</emphasis></p><p>PERKINS: Well, that's true. When you really look at how the financial cycle works, the V.C.s and the guys that got in the earliest, as Stephen was referring to, and sold out, you know, some time before last August did real well. And so there's a lot of fat and happy people here. But a lot of people, like you said, small people that lost a lot of money on this hype.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I know. Thank you very much, Tony Perkins of Redherring.com. And thank you very much, Stephen Roach, for joining us tonight. Jack Kemp, he's coming up next. Wait till you hear his prescription. He's gung ho for big tax cuts now. And later, what's at stake as the U.S. and China prepare to meet? You're watching HARDBALL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back. For more on the health of the economy, we're joined by Jack Kemp. He's director of Empower.org. Jack's group has just completed a study entitled \"Tax Rate Reduction, The National Debt and Economic Growth.\"</p><p>OK, the executive summary, sir? What do you propose to do with this ailing economy right now?</p><p>JACK KEMP (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE/DIRECTOR, EMPOWER.ORG: Cut interest rates, cut tax rates and signal to the Fed through the White House, through the secretary of the treasury or the president, that Alan Greenspan has got to loosen up, that we're in the midst of a deflation, falling prices, falling gold price, falling commodity prices, falling stock prices. This is very serious and the Fed has to inject liquidity into the banking system and provide more oxygen for the economy.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, increase the money supply. How do you get taxes down now? It's now April. We're talking about a tax to be, a tax cut to be enacted in July or August. How do you make it rapid and important right now to the economy?</p><p>KEMP: Make it retroactive, as I believe President Bush wants to do, across-the-board rate reduction, retroactive to January 1 and cut the capital gains taxes Trent Lott and Jon Kyl want to do.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yeah, but you can talk about that, but how legislatively do you do it? They've got a bill, it's moving through the Senate and the House now\u2026</p><p>KEMP: When it goes to conference, make it retroactive. The conferees\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: But there's no capital gains reduction in there.</p><p>KEMP: \u2026 between the Senate now -- they can put it in.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It's not in the scope.</p><p>KEMP: They can put it in or signal to the market that it's going to be the first bill after the passage of the tax cut.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let's talk about this recession. We've had three recessions now in 20 years now. If I look at it, in 1981 we had one under Reagan when he first came in. And then on Bush one, George Bush's father, we had a recession in 1991 and '92. Here we are 10 years later, evenly, here it comes again\u2026</p><p>KEMP: Yeah.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 2001. What's caused these three recessions?</p><p>KEMP: Very\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Because we didn't have anything under Clinton.</p><p>KEMP: Very, very tight money.</p><p>MATTHEWS: How come it didn't affect Clinton?</p><p>KEMP: Because\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: He had the biggest boom in history in the middle of these three Republican recessions.</p><p>KEMP: Yeah, yeah, because the Fed eased about 1992. The third quarter or fourth quarter of 1992, the last quarter of George Bush, Sr.'s term, the Fed began to ease. They brought the Fed funds, the overnight cost of money down, and that\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: So Clinton's lucky?</p><p>KEMP: \u2026 coupled with the Republican Congress cutting the capital gains tax, passing Roth IRAs, tariff reform, lower tariffs is a tax cut. And what we're arguing in our white paper, and Empower.org is the sister research arm to Empower America\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Sure.</p><p>KEMP: \u2026 we're arguing that cutting tax rates in and of itself is not enough, that the Fed is too tight. They need to injustice liquidity into the banking system and provide more oxygen for the new economy and the old economy, which is suffering the sixth straight month of industrial production falling.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We've had, we've got a track record here. Why do we have recessions under Republicans, Reagan, Bush one and Bush two, and not under Bill Clinton?</p><p>KEMP: A good question. I think Republicans basically tend to be fiscal, fiscally tight and coupled with the Federal Reserve board being tight, you get a recession. I would make a case that our situation today, Chris, is not unlike that when Reagan came in in 1980. Volcker wanted to stop inflation and he crunched down on the economy and on, and raised interest rates. The Fed funds rate overnight cost of money went up to 11, 12, 13.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Sure, Volcker did that.</p><p>KEMP: The tax cut was stretched out by Stockman into '83, '84 and '5. So between '81 and '82 you had a huge deflation, the worst in this century, and that's what we're going through today.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I buy all that\u2026</p><p>KEMP: Falling prices, falling commodity prices, falling gold price, falling industrial production, unemployment going up, no inflation whatsoever and the tax cut is not strong enough, although I'll give George W. Bush a lot of credit for pushing for an across-the-board Reagan like tax cut, it isn't strong enough when it's juxtaposed, when it's compared with the tight money of the Fed.</p><p>MATTHEWS: If we had had Ronald Reagan and we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, if we had Ronald Reagan for three terms, would we have had that recession 10 years ago?</p><p>KEMP: Oh, that's too hypothetical. In my opinion no.</p><p>MATTHEWS: If we had followed Reagan policies?</p><p>KEMP: If you remember, Reagan would, in my opinion, Reagan wouldn't have raised taxes. George Bush, Sr. and Jr. both recognize that that was a mistake. But right now the problem is not tax policy, albeit that is a problem, particularly two days after April 15th. Taxes are way too high, particularly on labor and capital. And\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, but you don't speak the same lines as\u2026</p><p>KEMP: But right now we're in a deflation. The price of gold is falling\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: You don't speak the same language as Alan Greenspan.</p><p>KEMP: No, I don't.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Alan Greenspan speaks Bill Clinton's language. Bill Clinton said I'm going to reduce the size of the deficit over time, I'm going to eliminate it over time and you're going to cut the interest rates. You're saying we're going to raise\u2026</p><p>KEMP: He's raising interest.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We're going to cut taxes and we're going to keep cutting them, including the capital gains, and we want you to lower interest rates, and he says I don't hear you cause I don't believe in that.</p><p>KEMP: Well, he may not, but I think somebody's got to tell him that when you have a\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: What do you got to do, how do you get rid of him? Alan Greenspan is here to stay, isn't he? You can't get rid of him.</p><p>KEMP: Yeah, you can get rid of him and I'm not about to call for his resignation. He's a friend and somebody that I have supported over the years and we have both supported many policies -- he wants to eliminate the capital gains tax.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Do you think smacking him around is going to get him to lower the interest rates?</p><p>KEMP: Jack Kemp smacking him around isn't going to do a thing. But I'm trying to get members of Congress to question monetary policy because basically there's three things that affect the economy -- fiscal policy, tax policy, traffic policy and monetary policy and Republicans, bless their hearts, I'm one, they don't talk about monetary policy and they let Alan Greenspan get away with saying two years ago that he was going to slow down the economy.</p><p>Now, unemployment is rising. How do you fight inflation by putting people out of work?</p><p>MATTHEWS: I get it.</p><p>KEMP: Where does it\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: So the Republicans, just to shorten up here, the executive summary is you're for lower taxes, including lower capital gains\u2026</p><p>KEMP: Lower tax rates.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Lower tax rates.</p><p>KEMP: Lower capital gains rates, eliminate the estate tax but\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: And you like free trade. You like the free trade policies of this administration?</p><p>KEMP: Lower tariffs.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Lower tariffs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEMP: An across-the-board tariff reduction would be $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2 trillion to the consumer over 10 years.</emphasis></p><p>MATTHEWS: But you don't like this arm of the president around Alan Greenspan? They're a little too cute together. You think he should just stick it to him?</p><p>KEMP: I'm going to say something on your show that I, that is very provocative. I'm going to mention that four letter word, G-O-L-D. The price of gold falling over time is a signal, is a market signal that the Fed is too tight. I'll give you one quick example.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right, because people buy gold when they see inflation coming?</p><p>KEMP: Absolutely. And they sell it when they need liquidity.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right.</p><p>KEMP: Now, listen to this\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let's come back.</p><p>KEMP: OK.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We're going to talk about China. We're going to talk about you and trade with China because it's a hot political issue. Are you a free trader or a cold warrior? Right back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: We're back. Jack Kemp, you're the number one tax cutter in the country. You've been selling this since 1978, very effectively. Ronald Reagan bought it and he did very well. But let me ask you about this, right now, this new president, a Republican, Reaganesque guy wants to cut taxes and he may do something on capital gains down the road. He may get a 1.4 if you average it out between the House and the Senate, tax cut, a big tax cut.</p><p>You're saying with all that effort and all that good success legislatively, as long as we have Alan Greenspan in there fighting inflation it's not going to work, we're going to have a big recession?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEMP: Well, if Greenspan continues to fight inflation when there is none, a $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.4 trillion tax cut aggregate over 10 years, 80 percent of which won't even happen until after the year 2005, won't make a tinker's damn of difference in this economy.</emphasis></p><p>MATTHEWS: Has he got, is he a Chicken Little, Alan Greenspan? Why does he keep fighting a fire that isn't on, that isn't burning, inflation?</p><p>KEMP: That's the question I'm trying to get the Republican Congress to stand up and ask Alan Greenspan. He went up to Congress two weeks ago and all he talked about, and god bless him, talked about trade. But he didn't mention monetary policy and he said two years ago that it was irrational to be buying stock at a time when the economy was growing and he was going to slow down the economy to fight inflation.</p><p>He fought inflation to the point where unemployment is rising, industrial production is falling, Nasdaq is on its keister and we now have Cisco, NorTel, Lucent and giant telecoms starved for capital.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Would you invest in the market right now? You're a private citizen as well as a smart guy. Would you invest in the market right now or are you going into bonds or something like that?</p><p>KEMP: There are some very good buys. Selectively, yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Selectively. That's a very calculated statement. Anyway, thank you very much, Jack Kemp.</p><p>KEMP: Thank you, Chris.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Mr. Tax Cut. Jack's report on economic growth is available at his Web site, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.empower.org\">www.empower.org</url>. </p><p>Up next, U.S. diplomats sit down with their Chinese officials, their counterparts. What's at stake in tomorrow's big meeting in Beijing? You're watching HARDBALL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: That 11-day standoff with China is over, obviously, but tomorrow in Beijing, eight American diplomats, including some military folk, are going to meet with their Chinese counterparts, including Chinese military people, to try and find out what went wrong and how to make sure it never happens again.</p><p>The two sides still blame each other, as we know, and the Chinese are holding onto that American EP-3 plane even now. The American team will try to win back the plane, but the Chinese want American spy planes, all the flights, called off their shores, wants them to end, period, an option the Bush administration has already taken off the table.</p><p>According to \"The Washington Post,\" the Bush administration is considering other measures to ensure the flights continue, including sending the U.S.S. \"Kitty Hawk,\" an aircraft carrier, to the South China Sea.</p><p>But some hardliners want the White House to go further and punish China for detaining those American air people. Punishment could include granting visas to prominent Taiwanese politicians, bulking up arms sales to Taiwan, including submarines, anti-sub planes, and Kidd-class destroyers, limiting military-to-military contact, cutting off exchange programs, imposing limits on technology transfers, opposing Beijing's bid to host the 19 -- the year 2008 Olympics, and delaying approval of satellite launches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If satellite launches are delayed, American companies are like Loral stand to lose big. Loral says it could lose up to $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">180 million if a deal to launch a satellite falls through with China.</emphasis></p><p>One area that doesn't seem to be on the bargaining table tomorrow is trade. A senior official tells \"The Washington Post\" the Bush administration is unlikely to seek limits on trade with China.</p><p>With me to discuss tomorrow's meeting in Beijing and what's at stake for both sides is Congressman Duncan Hunter, he's a Republican from California, a member of the Armed Services Committee. And out in Kansas City, Congressman David Dreier, he's also a California Republican.</p><p>Let's go to Duncan Hunter, congressman from California, should we punish China?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R-CA), ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Well, I don't think it's so much punishment, Chris, as looking at the big picture. And what we're doing with trade right now is sending an $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">80 billion-per-year surplus into the Chinese treasury, and they're using a lot of those billions to buy military equipment, primarily from Russia, like the Sovremennyy-class missile destroyers they bought last year.</emphasis></p><p>And they're aiming a lot of that military hardware at the United States, and we've now discovered in this incident of the last week or two that China appears to still have some hostility to the United States, and also has a foreign policy which at some point, with respect to Taiwan, may come into a clash with the United States military.</p><p>So the question to us is, should we as Americans be funding with American trade dollars the building of a military machine in China that our soldiers and sailors may one day face on the battlefield? And I think that's a real question, a long-term question, that the Bush administration must ask itself.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Congressman, what do you think would be the reaction in the Chinese streets, I mean, among the people, the young students, the intellectuals, the people that do follow the news, to the word that we have dropped trade with them and cut them off from our huge consumer market in this country? What do you think would be the reaction from the Chinese people?</p><p>HUNTER: Well, I don't know how they would react, but I know this. The hard dollars that they didn't used to have, for example, when they tried to buy these Sovremennyy-class missile destroyers in the early '90s, which were designed to kill American aircraft carriers by Russian technicians, they had the Sunburn missile, they're very effective, they're tough for our ships to handle, when they tried to do that and they had no cash, they couldn't do it.</p><p>Today they have cash, and the cash comes from the United States of America.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let's go, let's to go Congressman David Dreier. What do you think would be the reaction from the Chinese people if we tried to isolate them economically at this point in their rebounding history?</p><p>REP. DAVID DREIER (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, Chris, Duncan and I are like brothers. We came to Congress together two decades ago, and I consider him to be one of my best friends. But he is dead wrong on this. The single most powerful force for positive change in the 5,000-year history of Chinese civilization has been economic reform. Those dollars about which he refers go from the United States to China. And you know what it's done? It's dramatically improved the standard of living for people throughout China.</p><p>We need to make sure that we do everything that we possibly can to continue down that road. And why would we consider withdrawing the one good thing that is there? That's why, as you went through that litany of issues, I'm so happy that this administration has made what I believe to be the right decision, and that is taking trade off the table.</p><p>I just returned from Asia. I was in Japan and in Hong Kong last week. And it was a very emotional experience. I was on Okinawa at Kadena Air Base, where I met with the squadron commander of the EP-3 crew that was over there. And it was -- we are all so proud of George Bush, who did an extraordinary job in dealing with this tough situation, Chris.</p><p>It seems to me what we need to do is, we need to recognize that we've gotten strong presidential leadership. We've resolved a tough issue. And this meeting which is taking place in Beijing is a very important one. We need to remain very strong. We need to maintain our military preeminence in Asia. It's a very, very key\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Any difference would you advocate\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 thing for us.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 congressman, would you advocate any nuance of difference, given what happened in the last couple weeks or without that happening, between the Bush policy and the Clinton policy?</p><p>DREIER: Well, very clearly, President Bush has described the relationship as being one of strategic competition, as opposed to a strategic partner. Now, you can be friendly with your competitor. I made a very strong statement when I was meeting with the leadership in Hong Kong about Gao Zhan, who is the woman from Virginia who we very much want to have returned.</p><p>I also spoke very strongly about the fact that we've seen improvement over the years, but we have a ways to go.</p><p>So this administration, as I believe, following a tack which is correct, it's right on target. Sure, it's slightly different from the Clinton administration. But remember, Bill Clinton, when he ran for president, was virulently opposed to any kind of trade with China, and he finally embraced what I believe is the appropriate position. And that helps us right here in the United States.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Congressman, I want to run through these\u2026</p><p>DREIER: You know, and these consumer products that come in\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 I want to (UNINTELLIGIBLE) this issue, this menu of issues that's come up in \"The Washington Post.\" They've got a good reporter, I think, at the Pentagon. Should we continue the arms? Should we go with the arms sales of the Kidd-class destroyer to Taiwan? Should we try to stop them from getting the Olympics in 19 -- in the year 2008? Should we stop satellite launches with our technical assistance and knowhow? Where would you cut through that and say, This we should screw them with, this we should deny them, this we should leave alone?</p><p>HUNTER: Well, well, Chris, first, I don't believe in these symbolic efforts, like not going to the Olympics or trying to do something that simply slaps the other party in the face. I think what we have to do is substantive. And you know, the debate that we're having right now that David, my good friend and I, are having is one that we had in 1939 and 1940 with respect to the Japanese. We had a number of American industrialists said, Let's keep selling steel to the Japanese, we're engaging, we're bringing them around. They're going to work with us.</p><p>And yet, and yet in 1941, we saw that steel being transformed into warships which attacked us at Pearl Harbor. So\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, wait a minute\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 if you have this\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 congressman, there's another point\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 and Japan, and Japan turned\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 here.</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 on China. Exactly. And Japan turned on\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 whatever the A, B, C, D\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 China, that's the thing we need to recognize.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 embargo on oil that drove the Japanese to Pearl Harbor when the Americans that ducked the Canadians and we all basically said, You're not going to get any more oil, and your little country doesn't have any oil, they broke out, didn't they? Couldn't you look at it that way, starkly?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNTER: Well, well, well, Chris, if you look at it that way, then what we're doing is putting ourselves in even a more precarious position, because you're saying now, we're prisoners to $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">80 billion trade surpluses going the other way. And if that doesn't happen, somehow we're going to be vulnerable. And to an\u2026</emphasis></p><p>DREIER: Duncan, if you want to go\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 to an aggressive Chinese foreign policy\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 Duncan, if you want to back to -- Duncan, if you want to go back to\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: My point is, David, David, you want to\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 go back to 1939\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 you -- David, you want to watch those kids come in, and you told, you told me how much you care about those kids. My point is, if you really care about those kids in the Navy, you don't want to transfer technology and dollars that are buying technology from people like the Russians that one day may kill those kids\u2026</p><p>DREIER: It's a\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 on the battlefield.</p><p>DREIER: It's a -- it's improving the\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: You don't agree with that, do you?</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 quality of life -- Let me just tell you something. People like to draw an allusion. The difference between the Soviet Union and China is a very distinct one. If you want to talk about\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 class missile destroyers\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 1939 -- it -- let me just\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 aren't an illusion, David.</p><p>DREIER: Duncan, Duncan\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 missile destroyers\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 Duncan, I'm not talking\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 through the straits of Taiwan\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 I didn't say an ill -- I didn't say an illusion, I said an allusion. And the fact is, what we need to do is realize that it was the protectionist policies that the United States pursued in the 1930s that strengthened Adolf Hitler in Germany. And we need to realize that in this global economy\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: How did that work, congressman?</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 if we're going to improve the quality of life for the people in China -- How did it work?</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>DREIER: The protectionist policies that we as a nation pursued during the -- the Smoot-Hawley\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 disengaged the United States\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: There you have it, Chris, it was\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 of America from Europe\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: There you have it, Chris, it was protectionist\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 disengaged\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 policies that caused that collision out there off the Hainan Island, protectionist policies.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let me\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DREIER: No, no, no, absolutely not. No, we were doing that -- Duncan, we were doing the absolute right thing. And I support strongly the surveillance flights, the continuance of those. And we need to do everything that we can. And I'm glad that President Bush has taken that off the table. We're doing it legally, we're doing it appropriately.</p><p>All I'm saying is that if we choose to pull up the drawbridge and not expand our Western values into repressive societies like China's, we are going to undermine the prospect for positive change.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let me ask you, Congressman Duncan Hunter\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: How many American corporations complained, David, about the incident off Hainan Island? I don't think any of them complained. They continued to\u2026</p><p>DREIER: Duncan, Duncan, Duncan\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 50-cent-an-hour labor\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 let me just tell you\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 and that's what they\u2026</p><p>DREIER: Let me just tell you something.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK\u2026</p><p>DREIER: I talked to one of the top industrialists\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 any time you want to.</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 in this country\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let me, let me ask you both a question.</p><p>HUNTER: Sure.</p><p>DREIER: Well, let me just tell you, though, let -- Chris\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: One thing that we've learned in this whole episode is that there is Chinese public opinion. It's a dictatorship to a large extent. It is not a democratic society. But there is sentiment in the streets of China, especially among young newspaper-reading TV-watching Chinese. They're very nationalistic. They are not communists, but they're extremely nationalistic.</p><p>Is it smart U.S. policy, Congressman Hunter, to try to further aggravate that nationalism with some kind of revenge, whether it's cutting off trade at this point or whatever?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNTER: Well, first, Chris, I think we can have a good relationship with China without moving an $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">80 billion-per-year trade surplus their way, and without sending militarily critical technology into their military base like the supercomputers that we've transferred in the past under the Clinton administration. So I think even this administration, as free trade as it is, is going to want to look at some mechanisms to slow down the transfer of militarily critical technology that one day could kill young Americans on the battlefield\u2026</emphasis></p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 I totally agree with that.</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 reversing that trading\u2026</p><p>DREIER: I totally agree with that.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let me ask you both, simple question. Should we kill those satellite launches that are being put up there with the help of Loral?</p><p>HUNTER: I think so. I think that the hearings that we held in the Armed Services Committee showed that we gave a lot of technology that ultimately is used in ICBMs, the same ICBM boosters\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right, and the Democrats\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 that are aimed at American cities\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 got a million bucks for that too.</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 booster satellites.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And the Bill Clinton and the Democrats got a million bucks for that transfer of knowhow. What do you think, Congressman Dreier, should they -- we allow those\u2026</p><p>DREIER: I think this\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 launches? Go ahead.</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 I think this is a decision that we want to leave to the administration, and I happen to believe that we need to do everything that we can to try and expand getting information in, but not technology which can be used militarily against us. When there's access to information and technology from other parts of the world, we shouldn't undermine the United States on this.</p><p>And let me just say, top industrialists who are involved with China were outraged with the shooting down of our plane and so\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 or the -- our plane being knocked out of the sky\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Thank you\u2026</p><p>DREIER: \u2026 so don't claim that they're not\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 thank you, the two gentlemen\u2026</p><p>HUNTER: \u2026 how President Bush handled this.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 the two warring gentlemen from California, both Republicans, both in the same party, both from the same state, the same region of the state, believe it or not, they disagree.</p><p>Just a reminder, coming up tomorrow on HARDBALL, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice joins us, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, and Don Hewitt of \"60 Minutes,\" all here on HARDBALL tomorrow night. Also Tom Friedman of \"The New York Times,\" what a night we got coming tomorrow night here on HARDBALL. Stay with us for tonight.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, we have two wings of the ideological world of America. We got Katrina Vanden Heuvel joining us from \"The Nation\" magazine. She's the editor of that magazine. And from \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page, John Fund, one of the strongest voices on that very conservative page.</p><p>Let's take a look at the latest numbers. According to the latest Gallup poll, pretty good number here, 60 percent of the American people think Bush, the new president, is doing a good job keeping America prosperous. Only 30 percent say he's doing a poor job. Katrina, what is that about? Why do they like Bush two to one?</p><p>KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, EDITOR, \"THE NATION\": Well, I keep thinking of another poll, Chris, which came out just a couple weeks ago, which showed 60 percent of Americans believe Bush was favoring corporations, protecting them, over ordinary Americans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You know, your program before was about this tax cut. I mean, let's expose the cynical lie of Bush's tax cut. It is not for ordinary Americans. It is that -- it is front -- it is back-loaded in a way that isn't going to help the faltering economy, which is heading into the tanker, and, you know, what you really need is what a lot of Democrats have been talking about, the progressive caucus, which is a prosperity dividend. Let's give $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">500 rebate to low-income, middle-income\u2026</emphasis></p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 workers so you get it to people immediately. And that way you're going to help a faltering economy and help displaced workers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: You really think, though, that the Democrats would be pushing tax cuts even of this sort of ATM, go to your local machine and pick up $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">200 no matter who you are, which is sort of the approach everybody's talking about on the Democratic side, would they be pushing any tax cuts, Katrina, if the Republicans under President Bush hadn't been pushing them first?</emphasis></p><p>Democrats don't usually come out for tax cuts, do they?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, you know\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Think of that, I can't think of the last time they did.</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Well\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: When's the last time Democrats pushed tax cuts?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: But, but you're right, but the problem with\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: I mean, tell me the last time Democrats pushed a tax cut. Give me, give me the year.</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: I don't know, because\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, give me the year!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, you know, I want to say maybe 25 years ago. But the problem with the Clinton economic program was that it was Calvin Coolidge-like. It was pay down the debt, pay down the debt, instead of what this debate should be about right now, which is not about accounting and this $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.6 trillion folly, it's about the unmet needs and priorities of this country. That's what this should be about.</emphasis></p><p>And that's why\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, John Fund, let's bring you in here on the tax cutting. I just don't know any track record of Democrats to claim they're for tax cuts unless the Republicans push them first. You have to go back to Jack Kennedy, clearly, back in the early '60s, as far as I can remember.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>JOHN FUND, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, it's a lost tradition. I'm glad Katrina mentioned my favorite president, Calvin Coolidge, because he cut taxes, and that's how he reduced the debt. Revenues went up. So I really don't think that Katrina has a leg to stand on there.</p><p>As for corporations, Katrina, Americans have a balanced view of corporations. They suspect corporate power, but they also know corporations create jobs. And I'll agree with you, yes, the Bush tax plan in its original form was back-loaded. But now we're going to front-load it. We're going to add a lot more incentives so that they kick in earlier, Republican add-in retroactivity, so it will\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: When are we getting the first tax cut? When's the average person watching television\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Exactly\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 right now, John, going to get a buck back extra from the government?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: In about six years\u2026</p><p>FUND: No, because it's retroactive. You're going to see it the day it's passed, because it's going to be made retroactive. You'll see deductions from people's paychecks.</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: But the, but the larger problem, John, is that there is a lie underlying this budget and this tax plan. It is skewed to the rich, at the same time as the Republicans are screwing middle-income, low-income Americans by pretending that this tax cut is going to help them.</p><p>FUND: Katrina, the\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Listen, the people in the abstract don't like government. But when you ask them about government and health care and education and in their lives, they care. And two-thirds of Americans\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: I agree with that.</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 did not put the tax cut\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Katrina, once again\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 as a priority.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 you have tight (UNINTELLIGIBLE). I agree with you. We're right back with Katrina, because she's got a very good point about the environment. I think the tree-hugger argument over the environment never wins. I think the public health argument wins. We'll be right back to talk about the environment as a political issue, meaning cancer. Right back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let's talk political strategy, even though people here disagree, Katrina Vanden Heuvel of \"The Nation\" magazine and John Fund of \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>I want to start with you, John. It seems to me the -- that the idea -- that the people on the environmental side of the fight with industry always make the fight long term. It's going to affect the environment later on down the road with global warming, it's going to cause the extinction of some endangered species, for example, which will affect us ultimately.</p><p>But the short-term impact the bad environment, of a bad environment is cancer. If you've got dioxins, arsenic, things like that in the water, things getting into our food we eat, the fat we eat from meat and things like that, and getting into the air, not just cigarette smoke but industrial -- pollutions, pollutants, it seems to me that's a better way to address this issue, because it matters to individual families, all of whom who have cancer in their family.</p><p>FUND: Absolutely, but it should be based on sound science, not junk science. You know, Michael Kinsley, a card-carrying liberal, admitted in \"The Washington Post\" last Friday that Bush was right on the arsenic standard. I've talked to career people of EPA and Interior who say\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Why do you all of a sudden trust somebody like Kinsley?</p><p>FUND: Because it's\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: Who you always disagree with?</p><p>FUND: \u2026 I don't -- no, because he backs up what the scientists say. I'm simply saying even a liberal can look at the facts and come to the right conclusion. Chris, these career people of EPA and Interior admit that the Clinton administration set a booby-trap for the Bush administration. They purposely put in midnight regulations that they knew were unworkable, the Bush people would have to\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: So they were pandering\u2026</p><p>FUND: \u2026 walk back from.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 to the environmentalists' lobby but they weren't doing anything that would work, OK, I understand. Katrina\u2026</p><p>FUND: Well, no, no, because, because they knew the Bush people would have to repeal them. Therefore they would take the hit politically.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Do you see what I'm trying to say here, Katrina, that the average person is cared -- cares about the health of their family first and foremost\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Absolutely.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 and if you can address this issue to them, you got a winner, whereas if you talk long term, the environmentalists keep losing these arguments. I don't know, maybe they haven't, but\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, as I said before, I think when you talk about government in the abstract, you lose many people. When you talk about what government does and has done over decades, when you talk about, to a family, and say that there may be more arsenic in their kids' water, you are talking about a president who may become viewed, as someone said, as the Great Contaminator. He wanted to be the Great Communicator. But he has done what not many people could do, which is unite an environmental community.</p><p>This is not junk science. There is grounded science here around many of these issues\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: If it's, if it's serious\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 and if there is a payback here, if there is payback, if there's a Green payback, it is clearly that this is the most pro-corporate, pro-oil, pro-gas\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: But Clinton didn't do it till the last minute he was in office, why -- if it was such a good thing to do, why didn't he do it\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: He did many\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 in '93?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: I am not defending the Clinton administration. I'm saying there was a lot of work to be done under the Clinton administration which wasn't done. What is going on now, though, is an unprecedented rollback. It is a staggering list of pro-corporate paybacks. And John, don't give me the stuff about how I'm against corporations. There is a high road corporations should take, and that should engage taking care of families and people and putting those people first, not profits, in this country.</p><p>FUND: I never said you were against corporations. People are legitimately suspicious of corporate power. But they need to have a balanced view. Katrina\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: I'm balanced.</p><p>FUND: \u2026 these Clinton, these Clinton regulations would not have kicked in until 2008. If there is a clear and present cancer danger on arsenic, I think we would have seen the regulations kick in a little bit sooner.</p><p>The bottom line is, if you read the National Academy of Sciences report, it says there are no clear studies which show that link. Therefore, the Clinton people were just doing this for political purposes because they knew the Bush people would have to repeal them\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 but John, you know, but John\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 I got to interrupt, I've got one last topic. And Katrina, you get to lead the ball. The ball goes to you. One of the smartest, toughest people in Hollywood, one of the greatest singers probably ever, certainly up there with Sinatra, is Barbra Streisand, whether you like her politics or not. She wants to see a cable network formed which will basically offer a liberal point of view the way that I can think of one other network that gives the conservative point of view.</p><p>Do you think it would make it economically, and would it have an audience?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, first of all, my unders -- the met -- my understanding is that Barbra Streisand spoke realistically about how the Democrats should be far more aggressive. She's very -- you know, she -- she understands the cost now of this network and how, how -- that we should have been working on this decades ago. It's not too late. There's digital television, there's satellite television. But the costs, I think, have led her to understand the lack of feasibility.</p><p>But there are many other things that people of conscience, like Barbra Streisand, could do to energize the progressive base in this country.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Fund, respond, John.</p><p>FUND: There is a liberal feminist network out there. It's called Oxygen Media, and we all know how well it's doing. Clinton's former deputy White House counsel works there. Chris, what Barbra really said is, We want to get rid of these GOP talking heads. Well, the problem is\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 radio people too, like Limbaugh\u2026</p><p>FUND: Well, but\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 especially, I think, and G. Gordon Liddy\u2026</p><p>FUND: Well\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 and Ollie North and people like that on radio.</p><p>FUND: But the problem is, on television there's almost always balance. There's one liberal versus one conservative. So what she's really like, what she's really saying is, she doesn't like the debate because her side loses it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, I would like to know why -- and this is a fact -- why there's so many more conservatives who want to listen to political debate than liberals. And I don't quite know the answer. Do you know, Katrina?</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: I don't think that's the case. I think that these satellite digital programs, progressive left programs, have a fanatical following. But I do believe that the way the FCC's\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 moving, the media's moving, we are having a conservative landscape\u2026</p><p>MATTHEWS: John, you'll have to respond to that\u2026</p><p>VANDEN HEUVEL: \u2026 depoliticize these people.</p><p>MATTHEWS: \u2026 next time. Thank you very much, Katrina Vanden Heuvel, the -- of \"The Nation\" and John Fund of \"The Wall Street Journal.\" You get all the political buzz here any time on e-mail, hardball.msnbc.com. We'll be right back. You're watching HARDBALL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATTHEWS: My thanks to Katrina Vanden Heuvel and to John Fund. That's all the time we have today. Coming up next, Mike Barnicle's going to be here to find out if gas prices are going to go up this summer. And join me tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Eastern for Condoleezza Rice, right here on HARDBALL.

Thank you for creating an enabling environment by thinking about the regulations and eliminating redundant regulations that do not achieve the desired goals, but \"we need more workers and we are not willing to invest (in training) \".</p><p>Trump also said that there was no better time to be employed in America, but much has been said about how Americans are overworked and underpaid.</p><p>Trump appeared alongside Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the CTA, inLas Vegas to describe how the USA government is trying to work with private sector leaders.</p><p>It is not clear how Trump found her way onto the CES agenda-whether the Consumer Tech Association, which puts on the show, or the White House made the request.</p><p>Trump, 38, also commissioned the board to develop what she called an interoperable learning record.</p><p>Haka at Australian volunteer firefighter's funeral</p><p>Andrew considered his greatest achievement his 19-month-old daughter Charlotte, Mr O'Dwyer said, who he loved madly along with his wife Melissa.</p><p>\"It's not only about training for the jobs of the future\", said Trump in her speech.</p><p>The Trump administration has a list of policies that want the human resources departments of companies across the country \"to make sure they are not inadvertently selecting qualified applicants for jobs that now have vacancies\". \"The keynote that I'll be doing with Ivanka Trump will be focusing on. how industry is working with government on this very important issue\", he said.</p><p>She also spoke about her focus on workforce development in relation to her work as presidential adviser and how she acts as co-chair of the National Council for the American Worker alongside commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Trump referred to robotics and autonomous vehicles and how they can help in areas such as truck driving. \"We need to recruit and retain the world's greatest talent to help us grow and innovate, but we need to invest in American workers and get to the background\". \"So, I think wait until you hear what she has to say and listen to it because the fact is that there is afocus on jobs\".</p><p>Creative Strategies principal analystCarolina Milanesi blasted the choice of Ms Trump as a voice for female entrepreneurs, questioning her experience in the technology industry.</p><p>Before the keynote took place, many were confused and frustrated as to why Trump was given a place at the trade show, partly because of her status as a representative of an administration with policies many find distasteful, but also because her place could have been taken by a woman more connected to the technology sector and better suited to speak about how innovation will change the employment landscape of the United States and the world.</p><p>Brianna Wu, a video game developer who is running for Congress in MA, tweeted before the event decrying the decision to give Trump a platform over other women working in tech. \"I don't think it's unfair to believe that Trump didn't stop and think if she was the best woman for the job before accepting the CTA invitation\".</p><p>No stranger to such criticism - CTA was called to task previous year for having a paucity of female speakers at CES 2019 - the organization defended its choice, touting Trump's work on initiatives ranging from paid parental leave to funding for historically black colleges.</p><p>Update, 5:52 p.m. Add more quotes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4447443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-F9G1-DY7P-T05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stillman Advance: Stillman College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Tuscaloosa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>AL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001938</classCode><className>EDUCATION &amp;

Usually, the school and the yard are tied to the continuous fight to empower youth to push away the structures, strictures and sanctities of the corporate imperative to turn every human being on earth into a data point, all anchored to digital money, digital actualization and their new hierarchy of needs around the economic growth imperative of an endless conveyor belt of more and more junk technology turning us into more than mere addicts to their stuff.</p><p><br/> We are becoming the stuff . . . the junk!<br/> Now, education is bought, sold, packaged, constructed and manipulated into a conveyor of profit motive loving administrators, the infinite pigs of private (corporate welfare state) capital and venture funds who have their fat mitts into the public troughs. It's pervasive, the agnotology and outright stupidity of the common man, that is, you and I. I talk with twenty-somethings, and some in their thirties, and they just more than genuflect at the alter of the Kindle, the junk pop culture crap on TV or cable and the endless quest to just cobble together one crappy job with the next four.<br/> Just today, working with Portland liberals (culturally, pro-pot, pro-same sex marriage, pro-bike, pro-solar panel, pro-eggplant), even they have no clue about the US Postal Service: 'Oh, half the stuff is junk mail. The sooner they can get cut back, the better off the earth will be.' 'Oh, they are billions in the red, and the taxpayer will have to pay that to keep them going.' 'Oh, the union is too demanding, too much they want.' 'Oh, I can't wait till all our mail is delivered by email!' Not a clue about labor, collective bargaining, why it is a bit odd they are getting $10 and $14 an hour to take care of some pretty intensive cases of Developmentally Disabled Adults in group homes. All the training in critical response, first aid, behavior science, intervention, physical restraining, psychology, and all the re-certifications and mandatory workshops and classes, yet, Ten Bucks an Hour? No benefits? I am still amazed at how effective bad media, rotten press, endless cultural crap, all the music and digital zombie stuff infects youth. How youth still think the US of Empire is the Best in the West, and how all the other countries have it so-so much worse.<br/> Medium Well Done Is the Message<br/> I still am amazed at how bifurcated the world is, and how rotten at the top things are - NPR's Zionist and hyper-East Coast Whiny Crap Everyone's a Woody Allen-<person><nameText>Jon Stewart</nameText></person>-Barbara Walters clone or variation on a theme has infected them, and so has the droll of Huffington Post, and the barrage of the fabulous frivolous fakery of a music-art-food-theater-movie scene within a scene. Poly-amorous, Poly-historical, Poly-philosophical, Poly-capitalist, Poly-consumerist.<br/> The time now is the message, and the medium is the madness in their minds. Anything goes, as long as it's on a smart screen, i-Screen, Google Search, their own personal dozen blogs. How do you feel, America? China? Vietnam? Stupid pet-child-boyfriend-boss-blender-voyeur trick. This is the generation of peeping Toms, hyper distracted, disengaged, connected, flippant, urbane, casino capitalism. They actually think the Arab Spring was Twitter, and that there is an Arab Spring. Really? Which Spring is that?<br/> The absurdity of their own society high centered on the spine of the whale of corporation x, y or z. They doubt that Apple is Doing Wrong with Tax Evasions, and they think multiculturalism is Big Tech Getting More Exploited Immigrant Workers Vis-a-vis the H1-B Visas - 180,000 more a year, thanks to redneck Orin Hatch and compliant Democrats.<br/> They actually believe that Amazon dot Com is a bastion of democracy, creativity, the future, and oh so NOT Wal-mart! More ways to screw the American worker and the temporary migrant worker lured to the USA for that next big thing to screw humanity High Tech In-NO-vation, well, they think that's the price of collateral damage.<br/> They trust companies and guys like Branson of Virgin to solve climate change, and they think that there are so many downers in the world and on that progressive radio, 'that there's no use fretting about it all . . . have a hand-crafted mead or hoppy pilsner.'<br/> New\u00a0Hierarchy\u00a0of Social Media Needs\u00a0<br/> We are becoming genetically-wrapped to a new Maslovian chart of human needs, wants and actualization. It's definitely not tied to any holistic, community-driven and human centered needs to make sure young and old, poor and disabled, and those without education and skills get the largess of our effort to make sure the world is a place that can survive WITH us. Because of US. For US.<br/> Without belaboring the point, we have no choice but to drive all relationships and human and cultural endeavors around the FIVE e's of sustainability, all connected, all tied to an umbrella or superstructure around e-for education and e-for equity. With those two e's - Education and Equity - we will have the BIG e-for-environment covered. Those other e's - economy and energy - will then be put into a grander perspective and scaled toward the needs of 7 billion of us, or 9 billion creatures that we are, as we then develop a higher need of existence opposite to using nature as resource mine and dump and deforming culture around computerization and robotics/mechanization.<br/> It's nauseating - this brave new world of computing, err, work. So, the revolution will not be televised, nor will it be digitized. It's not going to be a resurgence in human rights, labor empowerment and community power through Tumblr or Yahoo or Fake-Book.<br/> This big lie of collective consciousness and public good will not unfold through the labyrinth of digital unreality. Each and every moment of this massive Handmaid's Tale of Digital Computing adds to the end of Homo Sapiens, or any morphing away from any semblance of a human with agency.<br/> The Consumer Species \u2014 Weather Makers, DNA Warp Drive, Engineered Thinking!<br/> We are Consumopithecus Anthropocene, living the lie of self-actualization and global connectedness in each and every corporate move toward seamless corporate access to our personal financing, biographies, lusts, loves and lamentations. Our bio-psychological-social states have been invented for us, smoothed and sculpted from the soft clay of corporate control.<br/> This hour has passed long ago when we have been able to leave behind our skins for a new skin. We are now in the silicon hands and microprocessor wombs of an infinite army of voyeurs, data collectors, men and women with unscrupulous power to invent more ways to move humanity toward extinction. We are the blood, sweat and tears of the new meaty ATMs of the Corporate Herding Networks.<br/> Communities are frayed, and Facebook and Amazon and Flicker and DARPA and DOD and Homeland Security vis-a-vis USAPATRIOT Act have squeezed the last breath of creative resistance and solidified revolution from the very fiber of our Hominid souls.<br/> We went through several million years of evolution as the walking species to be transformed into the marketing species . . . the ever-dumbdowning sub-species of simian whose goal is to find a smorgasbord of things to sell and buy. The mummies of the future, super-sized and big-gulped into HFCS wax figures, all preserved with Round-up Ready formulas and mercury tinted skin.<br/> On-line Obedience will continue to fray and immolate any chance of young and old to get off their keyboard-tapping asses to actually do something in the real. Cybernetics as emancipation my ass.<br/> The new speak is computer engagement, programming literacy, IT culture. These corporations are now dictating even what non-profits do. Even lowly organizations that are in existence to just feed the poor are marionette-ed by High Tech. All of us have to be programmers, web designers, flash movie inventors, and social media mavens to make it in the world of even social and environmental justice cause organizations.<br/> I can't teach English or writing anymore, without including 'setting up your own web site . . . blog . . . please turn in all essays with embedded links, videos, sound, colors, scratch and sniff biometrics . . . incredible ticker-tape motions.' The message is only the medium/multi-media/hidden codes.<br/> Bye-Bye Middle/Any Class \u2014 Pig Hearts, In-vitro Burgers, Petri-Dish Journalists<br/> It's absurd, really, that WE have to be all they want us to be when it comes to these captains of dig-i-tal-industry who blather on about how the education system is worthless because we are not producing their quotient of digital (computer programming language) multilingual software manipulators ready to force humanity to evolve into a nano-atomized scrolling, screen-fused thing that ponders endlessly the unending barrage of the meaningless, all that vapid data that could change the gravity of Saturn if it could be downloaded through the rings.<br/> We've allowed this endless barrage of the worthless and meaningless junk on the web to infect our every waking and sleeping lives. It's the constant bottom and top screen running headline news blathering nothingness and the naughty and necrophilia and nihilism of social misfits that we now all aspire to.<br/> Give me Tweets and Coffee House Banter and where did you get that cool pair of pants conversations. I'm not just talking about the creeps at Google and the creepier ones catapulting their version of humanity through the slipstream of instant flash movie, streaming video, quadraphonic sound through the bi-speckles of their future. Google Glasses filming of each individual's meaningless life, while walking, through sleep, shitting, sitting, snoozing and sneering. One unbroken stitched- together digital history of the meaningless meanderings of Consumopithecus Anthropocene contemplating silly cat tricks and the insipid lukewarm gesticulations of a mind morphed into data collection, Instagrams, Drop-boxes and cloud servers.<br/> Xenotransplantation? Nano-tech engines coasting through bloodstreams? RFID chips implanted in every human born[1]?<br/> Fake meat and Google Glasses. It's called In Vitro Meat IVM. We are so screwed! Look at this pap on Huffington Post -<br/> We know how to make the meat. All it takes is a biopsy of muscle cells from a living cow, chicken\u2026whatever\u2026called myoblasts. The cells are then grown in a nutrient-rich culture medium that delivers them all the goods that they would get in vivo-that is, if they were still inside the animal.<br/> But that's not all. They also have to grow on an edible scaffolding which would allow them to organize into 3-D muscle fibers that can stretch and bend. Essentially, they need to be able to exercise like traditional muscle, because of course, that's what meat is. Lots of labs are working on this, and the miniscule meat bits that they have been able to produce so far are kind of grey and flavorless.<br/> But that's what happens when you grow a thin sheet of muscle cells all by themselves. The holy grail of in vitro meat will be to make a product that simulates the complexity of muscle in a living animal. Truth is, that's probably not in the cards just yet. The first available in vitro meat will likely be a combination of muscle fibers, fat cells (for flavor) and blood vessels (for color and iron). They'll be grown separately and then mixed together. But I honestly don't see that being a problem. As Americans, we're kind of okay with the chicken nugget and hot dog culture we've grown to know and love.<br/> More[2]:<br/> Just read these putzes, and you understand how that a dozen blogs in every house mentality is just self-replicating stupidity[3]!<br/> Dang Duy Minh Quan, 1st Year student, Bachelor of Business Management, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University<br/> Executive Summary<br/> This paper provides an analysis of in-vitro meat and its viability as a meat substitute in the future. The paper will do so by first explaining the production process and history in order to set the context. The paper will then move on to discuss the potential economic, social and environmental impacts if in-vitro meat were to be successfully implemented. We will also address the challenges faced in commercial implementation of in-vitro meat and discuss the various issues surrounding this controversial new technology.<br/> The paper will conclude with the author's evaluation on where in-vitro meat will stand in the future.<br/> Introduction<br/> Food prices are rising. The total cost of conventional meat farming will continue to increase proportionately with the demand for meat due to exponential world population growth. In 2008, 18.5 billion animals are killed for food in the U.S alone, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2008). And for that many animals to be raised, a whole lot of water, grain and grass are required. This means that the meat industry is putting an enormous strain on the environment.<br/> They just never ever ask the right questions, make the right propositions, or understand the bigger picture around their consumer, artificial lies theses. Sometimes it's just difficult to begin to respond to the inanities. New book out by T. Colin Campbell -\u00a0Whole.<br/><br/>Nice review by a reader here: **[4]<br/> T. Colin Campbell follows up his groundbreaking book 'The China Study' that examined the impact of nutrition on cancer with 'Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition' which explains why there has been so much resistance by our health care system and government to examine nutrition's impact on our health. Campbell gives an overview of his research and the reasons why his work continues to be challenged. He provides insight into the medical community, pharmaceutical industry, supplement industry, media and government. He backs up his ideas and statements with examples and research making this book a rich source of information (much like 'The China Study') that everyone should read. Since his first book is such a large reason why this book was written I would recommend reading 'The China Study' before this book, but you don't have to read that book before this one to understand the issues. When I finished reading this book I was disgusted and discouraged by our health care system and inspired to do what I can to change it. I highly recommend this book to everyone because American's can't afford to ignore this research.<br/> Appeal Notes (May contain spoilers):<br/>Genre: Non-fiction, health, nutrition<br/>Pacing: Slow, academic<br/>Tone: Scholarly, disheartening, inspirational<br/>Writing Style: Descriptive<br/> Comments: This book is a must read for every American. Campbell's research and insights can not be brushed aside or ignored much longer. Even if you don't want to have anything to do with a plant-based diet you should be aware of how our healthcare system is operating (or not operating).<br/> These Zionists Love Control . . .

Hyperactive brains, hyperactive egos, hyperactive bank accounts, hyperactive\u00a0dis-associative\u00a0diseases! Glass? Trademarked by Google. Can I ever use the word 'glass' without paying Google a royalty[5]? \u00adAhh, a pair of glasses by Google, that grand lying company working on Completely Computerized Self-Driving Automobiles! Hyperactive Terrorists. Against humankind. Terror through the streets. Zombie growers!<br/>Google Glass isn't even for sale yet, but it's already facing backlash. There have been articles in the Atlantic and Wired mocking techies who have a pair, and even Saturday Night Live got in on the jabbing at the technology. The New York Times ran a front-page story about Google Glass and privacy, and the gadget has been banned from a bar in Seattle and casinos in Las Vegas.<br/> But for the earnest Googlers who helped create Glass, and the enthusiastic techies who already have their hands on a pair, all this hate can be a little bewildering. Most of the people I've talked to who have the fancy eyewear just love them. 'Just taking a hike on a Sunday, I've been blown away by taking pictures and taking video,' said Javier Echeverria.<br/> Mary Lambert got cooking instructions using Glass. 'The friend who I was doing it with could see what I was doing and was like 'No no no, that's all wrong,' which was really helpful and I didn't expect it,' she says.<br/> Right now, Google Glass might be the world's worst spy camera; if you go out in public with a pair on, you are guaranteed to attract attention. Still, the idea of techies mounting a tiny screen and a little camera to their faces makes millions of people uncomfortable.<br/> You even hear about these these 'magnificent' museum tours, sans human docents and dedicated and passionate museum staff, with these smart glasses that will be piping in music, video, some razzle-dazzle actor type blathering on and on about this or that feature.<br/> Wow, take granddad to Normandy Beach with Google glasses and let the flash video and layers of digital entertainment download while he hobbles on the beach where he lost 5,000 comrades. Megabyte and gigabyte memories, invented by those whiz kids with the programming prowess and endless dead sea thinking, that somehow, jobs are best done through microprocessors and video and sound cards.<br/> What a day - all those bombs, those 19,000 civilians, the visceral grit of war, replicated, digitized in unlimited variations of visuals, trivia games, film-spun encyclopedic facts, even the heat of bombs and acrid lung-sapping stench of burning flesh and diesel choreographed for the last World War Two veteran. Shifting social norms? \u00ad<br/> 'They realize that Google Glass will require shifting social norms to be accepted.' In that regard, the past few weeks have been rough for Google. If the company is going to turn around the public's impression of this product, it will need some help \u2014 from people like Sarah Hill.<br/> Hill is a storyteller for the Veterans United Network and a volunteer for Veterans Virtual Tours. She wants to use Google Glass to take World War II vets on virtual tours of places they might be too old or frail to visit in person. 'Places like the World War II memorial, Arlington National Cemetery [or] Pearl Harbor even,' she says.<br/> Hill is convinced that leading a virtual tour for veterans while wearing Google Glass would be completely different for them than showing the group just a DVD. She says it gives them the ability to ask questions and request certain sights and sounds, like the waves on the beaches of Normandy or the waterfalls at the World War II memorial.<br/> Little (and many) Eichmanns \u2014 Digital Wunderkinds Are Looking for YOU!<br/> Wow, what a day to look forward. Heil Programmer, Heil Apple, Heil High Tech. So, it goes without saying that another loser of the high stakes and rich kind of game - with plenty of bully pulpit support in the form of NPR, Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal fawning - is me, educator, and my dedicated brethren fighting to KEEP Humanities, Classics, History, and All the Meaningful Disciplines Worth Seating a Culture (yep, not IT, knowledge worker bs, economic 101 or post-Hedge Fund Version 3.0).<br/> These guys are not the great ones in this or the past generation, and their goals are tied to hucksterism - creating more and more layers of digital technology and digital communications, and all these little offshoots of junk, data points, endless flash videos and digital story books.<br/> They are in the business of selling billionth of a second ad space in the new world of wasteland web 4.0.<br/> Here is what one of the big names in High Tech has to say to recent graduates. The reason I started this column today in the first place:<br/> Dear college graduates: The next month is going to be thrilling as you cross this major milestone in your education. Enjoy the pomp and circumstance, the congratulations, and the parties. But when it's all over and you're ready to go out into the world, you'd probably like to meet me, or others like me\u2014I'm your next potential dream boss. I run a cool, rapidly growing company in the digital field, where the work is interesting and rewarding.<br/> But I've got to be honest about some unfortunate news: I'm probably not going to hire you. In part, it's not your fault.<br/> If you grew up and went to school in the United States, you were educated in a system that has eight times as many high-school football teams as high schools that teach advanced placement computer-science classes.<br/> Things are hardly better in the universities. According to one recent report, in the next decade American colleges will mint 40,000 graduates with a bachelor's degree in computer science, though the U.S. economy is slated to create 120,000 computing jobs that require such degrees. You don't have to be a math major to do the math: That's three times as many jobs as we have people qualified to fill them.<br/> Unless you understand the fundamentals of what engineers and programmers do, unless you're familiar enough with the principles and machinations of coding to know how the back end of the business works, any answer you give is a guess and therefore probably wrong. Even if your dream job is in marketing or sales or another department seemingly unrelated to programming, I'm not going to hire you unless you can at least understand the basic way my company works.<br/> And I'm not alone. If you want a job in media, technology or a related field, make learning basic computer language your goal this summer. There are plenty of services\u2014some free and others affordable\u2014that will set you on your way. Teach yourself just enough of the grammar and the logic of computer languages to be able to see the big picture. Get acquainted with APIs. Dabble in a bit of Python. For most employers, that would be more than enough. Once you can claim familiarity with at least two programming languages, start sending out those resumes.<br/> So congratulations again on your achievement\u2014and good luck getting your real-world education.<br/> Kirk McDonald, president of PubMatic, an ad tech company in Manhattan. Previously, he was president of digital for Time Inc. What a loser![6]<br/> Autistic . . . On the Spectrum . . . Asperger's? We Have Cubicles for YOU!<br/> Yes, real world is virtual world. The real world is maximizing profits, manipulating percentages, figuring how to sell time and space and human exhales and inhales. These people are the ones we have to fear - autism and untapped labor, err, exploitation and money-making market!<br/> \u00adWhite-Collar Careers [7]<br/> One Fortune 500 company that has begun hiring people with intellectual disabilities in North Texas is Alliance Data. Jim Pierce, vice president of Corporate Administration, says 'this is an untapped labor market.'<br/> He has hired a dozen people with intellectual disabilities.<br/> 'We've got this one guy, for example; his productivity is three times as productive as the person doing his job who did not have cognitive disabilities before him. And his error rate is 2 percent. He is 98 percent accurate. He's a phenomenal worker,' Pierce says.<br/> Pierce thinks it won't be long before more companies realize they're missing out on a hiring opportunity. In the meantime, nonPareil is trying to keep up with growing demand for training and jobs in Texas. It's looking to build more campuses in Fort Worth, and eventually in Silicon Valley, Calif.<br/> And the NPR, NBC, Junk TV, Dead End Tabloid News, Slick News-Zine 'beat' goes on!<br/> More Coming \u2014 All Those Books Written by the ONE Percent!<br/> We'll look at more of the High-Stakes, High-Minded, Whoopee Creative Class's look at how high tech kills US. These following people are are far from cutting edge, far from descent, far from holistic and concerned folk. They, of course, are the One Percent, and their perspectives are as skewed as Donald Trump's or George Soros', but we shall look at their theses in upcoming School Yard Fights, since the fight is about privatization, single thinking common core bs, and the digitizing of K12 and higher education, to the detriment of society, people, workers, labor, climate change mitigation, and an end to EMPIRE and NEOLIBERALISM.<br/> Jaron Lanier<br/> This week sees the publication of\u00a0'Who Owns the Future?,'[8]\u00a0which digs into technology, economics and culture in unconventional ways.<br/> Much of the book looks at the way Internet technology threatens to destroy the middle class by first eroding employment and job security, along with various 'levees' that give the economic middle stability. I paste the titles below from Alternet, another Zionist organization that is pushing the One Percent and 19 Percent's bs controlled opposition yammering.

The fourth time we voted that proposal down. Portland, the largest city in the country that does not have this industrial poison pumped into the water. The pro-fluoride\u00a0folk \u2014 lobby and goofy dental associations \u2014 spent big bucks on propaganda, and some families cancelled out votes for and against, but in the end, bye-bye more toxins in our water. Water that already is stressed by industrial pollutants, industrial farming, radioactive isotopes and drought!<br/> Measure 26-151 lost by a resounding 3-2 margin, the fourth time in five tries that Portland voters have turned down the idea of fluoridating the city's water supply.<br/> 'At a very fundamental level, people understand that we don't want more chemicals in our water,' said Kim Kaminsky, leader of Clean Water Portland, at a campaign party for fluoride opponents at the On Deck sports bar.<br/> The nonprofit Upstream Public Health brought the idea of fluoridating Portland's water to city councilors last year, quietly building majority support on the council before the public really caught wind the fluoride issue was back on track in Portland.<br/> The council unanimously approved fluoridating Portland's water last September, but the stealth campaign by supporters may have backfired.<br/> Fluoridation opponents, with little money or professional political help, quickly gathered enough signatures to force a public referendum on Tuesday. 'In 30 days, we put together an operation to gather 43,000 signatures,' said Rick North, a member of Clean Water Portland's steering committee.<br/> Portland is the last major city in the U.S. without fluoridated water, and, now that voters have spoken, will remain so.<br/> Ahh, E-D-U-C-A-T-I-O-N versus PROPAGANDA.<br/> Education wins!<br/> Community Action wins!<br/> Counter-Intuitive Thinking wins!<br/> Critical Thinking wins!<br/> Crowd Funding Everything<br/> We shall get into this soon in another School Yard Fights, but basically, now college researchers, chemists, what have you, are doing this on-line crap of crowd funding for projects. Can you believe that? Washington State University professor and scientist wants to see the effects of coal trains coming from the Powder River Basin to Washington to our export terminals, where that dirty coal will be shipped to India and China!<br/> Not that the coal companies have to pay and do the research on the effects of coal dust on communities. Nope! We have reached that stage in this f-ing country where we the community have to figure out the negative effects of a corporation's business model and actions on US, the community.<br/> So we go begging for dollars, again, thanks to the digital disgust of the IT kind. This is way sick beyond any decent level. Read how the Seattle Times misses key questions!<br/> 'There is no scientific research or study, or even anecdotal evidence, that coal dust from trains has ever negatively impacted a community in Washington,' BNSF Railway\u00a0wrote the government in January[15].<br/> 'So we don't even want to know?' Jaffe asks. 'Why not look?'<br/> Feeling stymied, Jaffe is trying an end-around. He's going straight to you to fund his coal-train study.<br/> He has launched a 'crowdfunding' proposal[16]\u00a0at a Seattle-based science-fundraising site called 'Microryza[17].'<br/> Two former UW researchers started it last year after they became disillusioned with the way science is funded (or often, not).<br/> Can't get your research backed by the usual government and corporate suspects? Then take it to the streets.<br/> Do you get the picture? Something is wrong but consistent here. Corporations are more than just people. They are the government, the regulators, the writers of laws, and the voice of communities. Seattle Times writers are as colonized as young kids with their iPhones.<br/> The Un-Education of these Reporters. Might as Well be Crowd Sourced Journalism!<br/> What's fascinating about Jaffe's experiment is that big industrial developments like coal terminals have long been able to limit official study of their projects.<br/> Their argument here is that it isn't fair to review things that happen along the existing rail lines, or after the coal is shipped overseas.<br/> The government should study changes at the loading-dock site only, not the regional or even global implications of shipping coal.<br/> Legally, that may be right. But the Web makes this framework moot. There's now little stopping a determined scientist from going rogue \u2014 from studying whatever he or she wants and submitting the results straight to the court of public opinion.<br/> Assuming the public will bankroll it first.<br/> I'm sure this won't go over well with the powers that be. It sounds like democracy and the free market in action to me.<br/> Danny Westneat's column [18]appears Wednesday and Sunday.

Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another border battle heating up. Democrats vowing to fight against the national emergency call by President Trump over border wall funding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The President, one, has the authority. Yes, it is a crisis and emergency our the border.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In this case, I think the President overreached. I think this is a constitutional issue. I think it's an important issue. And I do think it sets up a precedent for many reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Tens of thousands of people are set to protest the national emergency declaration. We're going to hear from law enforcement officials on what they're seeing at the border.</p><p>U.S. markets are closed today for the Presidents Day holiday. Futures relatively flat all morning. This after the major indices posted big gains on Friday. The Nasdaq composite leaving bear market territory along the way.</p><p>And checking on the global markets action in Europe, somewhat mixed -- CAC 40 is up.</p><p>Asian markets though higher -- China leading the way there in anticipation of positive talks this week.</p><p>Crude oil -- crude oil surging, the price of oil hitting the highest level of 2019. We're looking at what's actually driving that market.</p><p>And Payless closing -- the retailer closing all of its stores after filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>Plus, a tax on big tech. Tech giants Google and Facebook among those being targeted for bigger taxes and oversight.</p><p>And a messy finish, Denny Hamlin winning the Daytona 500 yesterday but it wasn't a pretty race with one crash right toward the very end claiming 21 cars. Highlights and much more coming up in sports.</p><p>And here to help break it all down -- pollster and Maslansky and Partners president Lee Carter; Wall Street Journal's global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and MaxFunds.com's co-founder Jonas Max Ferris.</p><p>All right, guys -- a lot of big things coming up here. Tomorrow's Walmart's earnings. We've got the China trade talks this week. A lot of things coming up.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think the Walmart earnings -- you referred to this earlier -- I think it's really important. You know, the economic data have been very strange and mixed over the last few weeks. We had a gang busters jobs report and then we turn around and get this total flop of a retail sales report. The manufacturing numbers have been up and down.</p><p>I think we have to look at some of these company earnings to try to get a sense of whether this economy is cooling down a lot more than people expected.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, you know, there's no better proxy for at least, you know -- for the heartland, the brick and mortar area, you know. And the third quarter data, the $124 billion in three months. And of course, the fourth quarter is going to be more than that. The question though is what the guidance is going be.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That retail sales report last week just didn't line up with what retailers have been saying.</p><p>PAYNE: Of course not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Retail numbers haven't been that bad.</p><p>PAYNE: Internet sales down 3.9 percent. Come on -- give me a break. Department store sales down 3.3 percent, maybe. We can live with that, we can understand that. But out of like 11, 12 categories only two were higher, right.</p><p>So you're right. It's not exactly what we're seeing -- and we're not seeing that in the market at all.</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOUNDER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Maybe, the Commerce Department employees were angry about not getting paid, they're like I'm just --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>PAYNE: They missed a few keystrokes --</p><p>FERRIS: Internet sales were whatever I said they were.</p><p>But Walmart, you know, normally Walmart I think would be a better indicator. But besides the fact they have problems with a lot of their items are under tariffs essentially, that has pressure problems.</p><p>But then you have blooms (ph) like basically you have a store like Payless goes out of business. That business -- a lot of that is going to Walmart on some level.</p><p>PAYNE: Toys R Us -- a lot of that business goes to Walmart.</p><p>FERRIS: Yes. Like they should be benefitting. On the other hand, they got a lot of pressure from Amazon. So like there's so much going on that I think it's hard to say, oh yes, it's like a normal -- like 50 years you go back, the consumers fine, Walmart sales are up. I think there's just too much going on in that business right now to make a call.</p><p>PAYNE: All right. We'll leave it there.</p><p>Coming up this morning OPIS chief oil analyst Tom Kloza is with us; former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy; former California congressman and U.S. Trade and Development Agency head nominee Darrell Issa; and former chief of staff under Bill Clinton and McLarty Associates chairman Mack McLarty. You do not want to miss this all-star lineup.</p><p>Also our top story of the hour -- border funding showdown. A wave of protests are being planned across the United States for Presidents Day. This in response to President Trump's national emergency declaration. Democrats vowing to fight back with some already planning lawsuits.</p><p>On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Maria Bartiromo spoke with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy who says the President was right in declaring an emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Is this a national emergency? Your reaction to what's happening with the President saying that it's a national emergency, but some of your colleagues are pushing back.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, it is a crisis and emergency along our border. First of all think about the human trafficking that is happening --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: -- think about the children that are being moved across this country. But think about the amount of drugs and how many thousands of Americans are dying and most of that is coming through the southern border.</p><p>Yes, it is an emergency that has been shown before. And I believe at the end of the day this wall is going to be built, not sea to shining sea, but about 200 miles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Joining me now -- Jackson CountyTexas Sheriff A.J. Louderback and retired sheriff and executive director of the Texas and Southwestern Border Sheriffs' Coalition, Clint McDonald. Gentlemen -- thanks for joining us.</p><p>M1: Thank you.</p><p>CLINT MCDONALD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TEXAS AND SOUTHWESTERN BORDER SHERIFFS' COALITION: Good morning.</p><p>PAYNE: Clint -- let me start with you, the media joining in with Democrats essentially saying this is a crisis made up only in the mind of President Trump. There is no crisis.</p><p>Entries -- illegal entries are down, apprehensions are down and that this is much ado about nothing. What do you think?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, as I represent 31 sheriffs along the southern border of the United States with Mexico, I can tell you that we've been fighting this battle as a group since 2005.</p><p>It is not just about the issue of right or wrong. It's also the collateral damage that is causing these individual counties and the expense of this illegal traffic coming through our counties. And so its collateral damage is sometimes devastating for some of the smaller counties as to what they're having to face in monetary expense to those borders being open.</p><p>PAYNE: A.J. -- you met with President Trump at the White House last month. How have you seen this administration's work on the security of our southern border? Do you think they're heading down the right path.</p><p>A.J. LOUDERBACK, JACKSON COUNTY TEXAS SHERIFF: Clearly a superb job by the administration. Let me reiterate what Clint is talking about here. Border sheriffs, Texas sheriffs, every sheriff in this nation are fighting the effects of the southern border.</p><p>We've been crying for decades for something to be done about this. It's time now. Clearly, it is a major issue for us in law enforcement in this country.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: So gentlemen -- a lot of the opposition to the wall and to secure borders is that this is inhumane. That this is a humanitarian issue, that we're not treating people fairly. Can you tell me how you react to that?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, I can tell you as a retired sheriff and working on the border for the last 34 years that humanitarian crisis that we see is we do not want to get another call to have to go and pick up a body of someone who is trying to get across these borderlands and is deceased. That is a call not one of our 31 sheriffs ever want to get again.</p><p>So when we look at the inconvenience of maybe families being taken apart or that -- that is a humanitarian issue, but to go and pick up a body that -- no sheriff wants to do that.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. There's no doubt about that. What do you make of the notion though that this issue has been resolving itself? There was some misleading headlines on Friday saying that last year was the lowest in apprehensions.</p><p>That was actually fiscal year '17. Fiscal year '18 saw a 17 percent jump. And so, again, when you have the media putting out a narrative, gentlemen, that this is something that was working itself out, that it is not a crisis -- how do you articulate to the public that yes, indeed, this is something that by the way serves both sides of the border -- Americans and those who seek to come here illegally.</p><p>LOUDERBACK: Well, Charles -- exactly that. And you have a tremendous amount of misinformation, outright deceit about what's going on here. There's no working this border situation out unless we were able to put the barriers that we need, the infrastructure that we need to regain operational control of a border that we haven't had for decades.</p><p>This is a long-time problem that Texas sheriffs and other sheriffs in this country have been representing. The simple idea that we have to fight over national security is, for law enforcement officers, professional law enforcement officers in this country, is ridiculous.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, gentlemen -- I want to say first and foremost thank you for your service -- Sheriffs Clint McDonald and A.J. Louderback. And we appreciate you, people who work this, who have seen the damage, the carnage, the pain and suffering, to share those stories with us -- thank you very much.</p><p>LOUDERBACK: Thank you -- Charles.</p><p>MCDONALD: Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, Payless is liquidating. The retail chain will be closing all of its stores in the United States. What it means for you and the future of retail. That's next.</p><p>Also taxing big tech. New Zealand becoming the latest country to crack down on tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Wait until you hear the details, straight ahead.</p><p>PAYNE: Several officers wounded in Aurora, Illinois plant shooting are out of the hospital.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Charles.</p><p>Four of the five Aurora police officers that were injured by gunfire, excuse me, in Friday's mass shooting are back at home this morning. The other expected to survive.</p><p>Police say a factory worker opened fire after he was told he was being fired from his job. Well, five people, all employees of the plant, were killed including one intern that was his first day on the job. Police did shoot and they did kill that gunman.</p><p>More than a thousand people battled freezing weather to pay their respects to the victims in an emotional prayer vigil. They also walked four miles from the plant to the Aurora police station to thank all of the first responders.</p><p>Well, liquidation sales of Payless Shoe Source are now underway. The company is closing all 2,100 of its remaining stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. Stores are going to be open until at least the end of March. Most of them may be open through May.</p><p>Payless filed for bankruptcy back in 2017. Now, one tip for shoppers out there. The best deals may not come in the sales' early days. There's still a lot of inventory that they've got to work out. So the next three months could be some bargain hunting for those of you who like their shoes.</p><p>And then there is this -- a mixed win at the box office this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It may be the biggest mistake of your life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what's that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Underestimating who I am.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Ok. So \"Alita: Battle Angel\", took the top spot over Presidents Day weekend, about $28 million. The film though leading the worst performing Presidents Day weekend in 15 years. The \"Lego Movie 2\" came in second, that brought in $21 million; \"Isn't It Romantic\" at the number three; followed by \"What Men Want\" and \"Happy Death Day 2U\".</p><p>Wish I had better news from the box office over the weekend. But by the way, do you remember what opened up on Presidents Day weekend last year?</p><p>PAYNE: I don't.</p><p>CASONE: \"Black Panther\".</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, golly.</p><p>CASONE: So imagine what can compare to that.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Night and day, to say the least.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, oil in focus, Brent crude on track for its strongest first quarter in eight years. We're going to break it down what's driving these gains.</p><p>Plus, a wild crash -- Denny Hamlin winning the Daytona 500 yesterday but it just wasn't a pretty race. One crash near the very end taking out 21 cars in the running. All of the sports highlights later on this hour.</p><p>PAYNE: Oil in focus, Brent Oil slipping this morning but still on track for its strongest first quarter since 2011. This coming as investors remain hopeful over supply cuts and global trade talks.</p><p>Joining me now, chief oil analyst with OPIS -- Tom Kloza. Tom -- thanks for joining us.</p><p>TOM KLOZA, CHIEF OIL ANALYST, OPIS: Good to be here.</p><p>PAYNE: Oil has been whipped around like crazy in the last year or so. And just as you think it's going to break out, it collapses and just as you think the collapse is going to continue, it finds a way to rebound. What's driving all of this?</p><p>KLOZA: Well, I think first of all, you have to recognize that it got over- sold tremendously in December. I mean, there was no reason for WTI to get down to about $40 and Brent to get down to about $50.</p><p>And then you did have OPEC really coming in with cuts and they are for the moment over-complying, at least the Saudis are. You know, they're complying to the tune of 120 percent of the cuts.</p><p>Now, don't expect that at the end of this year we're going to see a quarter like the first quarter and subsequent quarters. There's only so far we can go. And U.S. production will probably surpass 12 million barrels a day this morning. It was five million barrels a day back in 2011.</p><p>And I think world demand is going to slow a little bit. You know, most of the forecasts have been at 1.5 million, 1.6 million barrels a day because of emerging market growth. That will probably pull back a little bit.</p><p>So we think it's going to be a cheaper year than last year but a lot more expensive than what we saw at the end of December of 2018.</p><p>FERRIS: Tom -- Jonas Ferris here. Is any of this responsible -- I keep thinking like peak car, I keep seeing numbers like with Uber and everything. Millennials don't want to buy cars -- like does that have any role at all in this relatively low oil price? Everybody five, ten years ago was thinking $100 was the new normal in oil. And it seems barely able to stay over $50. Or is it really just what's going on with OPEC and Russia and global demand?</p><p>KLOZA: We've seen car sales really tail off and they particularly tailed off in China in 2018. I don't think we're at peak car. But you know, there's going to be a point here probably this coming decade where we'll be peak internal combustion engine car.</p><p>And we're going to be competing with electrons -- there's no question about that. Whether that happens in 2028 or 2030, I'm not sure.</p><p>But, you know, we're about 101 million barrels a day right now in terms of demand. That's not going to grow at the pace that it grew at in the last 10 or 20 years and it's basically because you've got billions and billions of dollars that are going into electric vehicles. And you've got some great strides that are being made with battery prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Tom -- oil prices drop in the fourth quarter was a sign that the global economy was slowing down. Now that we see prices firming up, what is that telling us about the global growth backdrop? Are things firming up out there?</p><p>KLOZA: Well, I think prices dropped probably on the premise that we were already in a recession and we were headed to recession and I think people have backed off from that. I think the economy couldn't, you know, keep up its sort of just incredibly robust pace.</p><p>But it is something to watch, you know. Gasoline consumption in the United States can be a real, real leader of what the marketplace is doing.</p><p>Right now, it's ok. It's about where it's been the last few years. But there aren't many things that can catalyze it.</p><p>The President is going to have a difficult time with gas prices this year. He's going to see prices go up in the spring as they normally do and we'll probably get to about $2.70 a gallon or so.</p><p>And he's got the two levers. He's got the lever with the sanctions on Venezuela and the sanctions on Iran. And a little bit too much pushing on one lever could send prices a little bit too high. And he's made it clear, he likes low gasoline prices, he likes to take credit for low gasoline prices. And he recognizes that that's a big thing for his base.</p><p>PAYNE: Tom -- about four or five years ago, ExxonMobil wrote this amazing piece. It was maybe a hundred pages. And essentially what it boiled down to was they guaranteed that they would be able to sell every ounce of oil that they have in-ground right now by the end of time. In other words, all of these wars that we hear against fossil fuels, against gasoline, against crude oil, that they will never truly impact what we have in terms of supply. Do you agree with that?</p><p>KLOZA: Well, I think they've changed their tune to a certain extent. There will be a peak demand period. That peak demand is probably at least 10 or 20 years off.</p><p>The interesting thing is what really has helped Exxon Mobil, and has helped a lot of the companies in the United States, is the export market. There's going to be weeks in 2019 where we're going to be exporting five million barrels a day of crude oil.</p><p>Now, compare that to 2015 or even early 2016 when there was an export ban and you could not export anything. So we are going to be a bigger exporter in the world than everyone but Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're going to surpass Iraq, Iran -- you name it. And it's going to happen quick.</p><p>PAYNE: Tom. Tom Kloza -- thank you very much. Really appreciate it.</p><p>KLOZA: Thanks -- guys.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, coming up -- McCabe speaking out. The former FBI deputy director outlining alleged discussions about ousting President Trump in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR: The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: More on the bombshell revelations next.</p><p>Also, Facebook under the microscope, why U.K. lawmakers are calling for tougher regulations on the social media giant.</p><p>PAYNE: Welcome back. I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo, Monday, February 18th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Speaking out, Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, revealing why he felt the FBI had to investigate President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY, 60 MINUTES ANCHOR, CBS NEWS: Are you saying that the President is in league with the Russians?</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR, FBI: I'm saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. If we failed to open an investigation under those circumstances, we wouldn't be doing our jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: More shocking allegations from McCabe's interview last night, and this morning, there are calls for an investigation.</p><p>U.S. markets are closed today for President's Day holiday, the Futures searching for direction all morning long. This after major indices posted its solid gains on Friday. The NASDAQ Composite, in fact, leaving bear market territory, and checking the global markets (INAUDIBLE) mix, CAC 40 up the most, the other major indices, down.</p><p>Asian markets, different picture, finishing higher across the board, led by a strong move in the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>Tax on big tech giants, Google and Facebook, among those being targeted for bigger taxes and oversight, and then a wild day on the track, Denny Hamlin, winning the Daytona 500 yesterday, and it was not a pretty race. One crash, claiming 21 cars, we've got those highlights straight ahead.</p><p>And nailed it, singer, songwriter Anthony Hamilton, bringing down the house with this unusual performance of the National Anthem, at last night's NBA all-star game. Wait until you hear it.</p><p>Our top story this half hour, President Trump, slamming Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter, wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions, another beauty, look like they were planning a very illegal act and got caught.</p><p>There's a lot of explaining to do to millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them, with the military, vets, economy, and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous insurance policy in full action.</p><p>Now, in the interview with 60 Minutes, McCabe said conversations about the 25th Amendment did indeed happen. On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" Representative John Ratcliffe says that there were issues with McCabe's story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCABE: Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.</p><p>PELLEY: Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the President.</p><p>MCCABE: That's correct.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R), TEXAS: As a conspiracy starts to unravel, sometimes the co-conspirators turn on one another and you get inconsistent testimony. Bruce Ohr's testimony is inconsistent with his boss, Sally Yates. Andy McCabe's testimony is inconsistent with his boss, Jim Comey. Jim Comey's testimony is inconsistent with his lawyer, Jim Baker. McCabe's testimony is also inconsistent with Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Joining us now, Former Federal Prosecutor and FOX News Contributor, Andrew McCarthy. Andrew, you saw the interview. You saw the news leading up to it. What do you come out of it thinking?</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think the biggest take- away, Charles, is that they tried to insert Russia as the reason for McCabe, opening an investigation on Trump. My own belief, by the way, is that they had been investigating Trump all along.</p><p>The only thing that happened in May of 2017 is they went overt in their files on what they had been doing for months before that. But what they were very careful in the interview, not to do, was to say what it was about Russia that Trump wanted, for example, Rod Rosenstein to put in his memorandum, removing Comey, and what it was precisely about Russia that Trump was worried about at the time.</p><p>They just kept saying Russia, Russia, Russia. What was actually going on was, Comey, in public testimony, had suggested that the President was a suspect in the investigation. Privately, Comey had been assuring the President that he was not a suspect.</p><p>And what Trump wanted was for Comey to say publicly or at least it to be known publicly, what he was being told privately, which was that the President was not a suspect in the investigation. That was the aspect of Russia that he wanted publicized.</p><p>PAYNE: Now, you wrote a piece last week titled, McCabe, Rosenstein and the real truth about the 25th Amendment coup attempt. In it, you said that the conversation to remove the President was no joke, but of course, the idea was lunacy.</p><p>Rosenstein, in that interview, it seemed to say -- not Rosenstein, I'm sorry, McCabe, suggesting that, no, there was no joking about any of this stuff, from wearing a wire to the 25th Amendment.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, I think, Charles, that McCabe was quite right about that. Rosenstein didn't, you know, idly come by and make a few jokes about the 25th Amendment. What they were talking about at the time was, is there a way to remove this president.</p><p>And if you talk about invoking the 25th Amendment, what that involves is gathering together enough of the cabinet to, at least, raise the issue with the vice president and try to invoke it. McCabe and Rosenstein themselves were not in a position to invoke it.</p><p>And one way you would try to generate that kind of support would be to generate evidence about it, which is obviously why Rosenstein suggested wearing a wire, in hopes of catching the President on tape, saying something that was either crazy, that suggested that he was not up to the job, that he was corrupt or what have you.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But that was the whole idea. The idea of recording him was in order to fortify this idea of the 25th Amendment, which I think they quickly dismissed because they knew there was no prayer, number one, that they could get enough support for that. And number two, the 25th Amendment is really not for the situation that they were dealing with.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: So, I watched the interview and I was looking at it, you can look at it two ways, right? You could look at it and say it's completely damning of the president, say this is absolutely one of the worst things that he was -- you know, that he's nuts and that he needs to be out of office, if you watch it one way.</p><p>You could watch it another way and say, I've got a lot of questions about McCabe, sounds like there was a lot of chaos, that's very believable. But, when there's chaos, you might have these kinds of conversations. Can we pull the 25th Amendment? Can we get him out of office? I'm so frustrated, the whole thing's nuts. But you could have a lot of questions.</p><p>And when you watch this as an attorney or prosecutor, what questions did you have or what did you take away from the interview?</p><p>MCCARTHY: My big thing was why doesn't he ask him what it was about Russia that Trump wanted in the report that -- or the memo that Rosenstein wrote, what they said in the conversation was that Trump told Rosenstein that he wanted Russia in the memo, removing Comey.</p><p>And it seemed to me that Lester Holt -- it wasn't Lester Holt, I guess it was 60 Minutes last night.</p><p>PAYNE: Scott Pelley.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Scott Pelley. What Pelley should have asked him at that point was, what was it about Russia that he wanted Rosenstein to say? Instead, they just left it out there that it was Russia that sounds really sinister. But if you go back in time to what happened, Trump obviously wanted Rosenstein to say that Comey had told him on three occasions that he was not a suspect in the Russia investigation.</p><p>And we're not speculating about that. We know that because the President, on top of the memo that Rosenstein did, put a cover letter, in which he made sure that everybody knew that Comey had told him three times he wasn't a suspect.</p><p>PAYNE: Andrew, this is now being called -- I've seen some call this a political coup attempt, perhaps, a bureaucratic coup attempt, a soft coup attempt. Does this rise up to some form of coup? Was there the idea that the FBI, because they were upset with the outcome of this election, using Russia as an excuse, where he wanted to try to find a way to remove the President of the United States?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. These guys, Charles, were definitely coup-minded in May of 2017, but I think this is a much bigger trajectory. It goes back many months and I don't think there's any question that they were trying to make a case on President Trump, even as they were telling him he was not a suspect in the investigation.</p><p>PAYNE: Andrew McCarthy, thank you very much, really appreciate it.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you, sir.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, cracking down on big tech, internet giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook, among those being targeted for higher taxes and more oversight. Plus, a wild wreck, Denny Hamlin, winning the Daytona 500 yesterday, but it was not pretty. One crash, in fact, took out 21 cars. All of the sports highlights are coming up later this hour.</p><p>PAYNE: Cracking down on big tech on two fronts, Lauren Simonetti has all the details. Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Charles. So, we're talking about some big multi-national companies that are in government crosshairs once again. It's something called a Digital Services Tax. New Zealand is now considering it.</p><p>So, this is a flat rate tax, between two and three percent on large social media, internet or advertising companies' revenues. Let me give you some numbers to show you how big this could be.</p><p>So, officials estimate that the value in New England of all of those services, are worth in U.S. dollars, so it's clearer for us, $1.9 billion. A tax on that would be $55 million going to the government. The Prime Minister says this is a way that big companies pay their fair share.</p><p>So I started looking at the share that companies pay and here's Facebook, as an example. Tax year 2016, they paid taxes, $43,261 on an estimated $100 million in revenue. Are you ready for the tax rate? 0.04 percent, it's not just New Zealand, several countries in Europe and Australia, also considering digital services taxes.</p><p>The worry is, this is the flip side, that businesses bolt, they leave. Let's stick with Facebook and let's stick with the United Kingdom right now because they have a message for that company. Regulation is coming. There's a scathing new report out, it's from the House of Commons, and it concludes that Facebook violated data privacy laws repeatedly and knowingly.</p><p>That CEO Zuckerberg failed to show personal responsibility over fake news, showed contempt toward parliament by not appearing before them. They did this investigation for a year and-a-half and the recommendation is that social media sites, so not just Facebook.</p><p>They liken them to digital gangsters. That's a quote, that they should follow a mandatory code of ethics that would be overseen by an independent regulator. And I know our worry with so much of this is --</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- its government overreach. Facebook says we're open to meaningful regulation. And that's important.</p><p>PAYNE: Man, if you could boil that down to a company motto, sounds like do no harm, or do no evil. It's really -- it's really nuts, though, isn't it, Lee?</p><p>CARTER: It's unbelievable.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: I mean, that kind of language coming out, talking about what they were doing, digital gangsters, I mean, think about that coming out from the U.K., and what that means for their reputation overall. I mean, we're seeing -- it's -- they're in a real conundrum.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: What about attacks? What about attacks on their revenue? Is that -- you know, what's striking to me is that, you know, that would have been unheard of 10 or 20 years ago, and now it's gaining steam.</p><p>SIMONETTI: In France, in Ireland.</p><p>HILSENRATH: These companies are facing blowback on the right and on the left. I mean, we don't hear people on the right saying, no, no, a tax is crazy. You can't do that on companies like this.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right. But do you think they should pay more? Should their fair share be bigger than -- it's all legal what they're doing, but should it be more than basically, zero percent?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOX NEWS ECONOMIC ANALYST: Yes, I mean, this is a regulatory issue about all the stuff they pulled and the digital gangsters. I mean, there's the no one's paying any tax side of the story, which has nothing to do with them.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Two totally different things.</p><p>FERRIS: And the tax side, I think the concept of corporate taxes on a tech company is questionable. The bottom line is, they're not going to pay it. They're routing money through. They can make the profits appear in whatever country they want.</p><p>And governments are going to have to figure out a way to make it more transactional, in the case of advertising, where you will be like, OK, we're going to put a tax on ads that appear in this country, period. Like, if it's -- you can't make that appear in Ireland, like, that's 200 (INAUDIBLE) whatever it is, 100 million.</p><p>They're going to need to collect money somewhere. It's not fair to other businesses that pay taxes, right? So, either way, we've got to get rid of corporate taxes or have higher income taxes or some sort of sales tax or we've got to hit these companies on transactions in countries where they're doing business.</p><p>PAYNE: The OECD is actually working on that right now, so that, you know - - you've got them trying to actually -- all of these major countries are actually working together on how to put together a tax regime that these big companies can't escape.</p><p>FERRIS: It's whack a mole. They have to cover all the holes.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I highlighted Facebook.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Tax reform was supposed to address that when we lowered the tax rate and then, you know, tried to cut all these loopholes on overseas taxes. So, the Trump tax reform was supposed to bring home more of the --</p><p>PAYNE: I think it's bringing home, money, but then the other argument there would be what are companies using it for which is a different, I think, over the idea that they're not paying any taxes if they can locate their domicile in Ireland or something like that.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And I was just highlighting the social media companies because we talk about them a lot. But, this is most major companies. It's Uber, it's Airbnb. New Zealand didn't specify which ones exactly. But you just have to look at the umbrella when they say the types of companies to fill in the blanks.</p><p>FERRIS: This comes back to the digital gangster part of this. It's like, you know, when you really look at what these companies are doing, there's an element of digital gangsterism going on. They've gotten a real pass for decades. And we've grown this huge industry.</p><p>PAYNE: The jig is up. Everyone knows that they're greedy, as any company on Wall Street, any oil company --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: They're as greedy as anyone else. And they no longer have good will that, by the way, allowed them to get away with that stuff. It might be bad for them.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Companies are supposed to be seeking their own process as shareholders.</p><p>PAYNE: It might be bad for them. All right, Lauren, great stuff. Thank you very much. I can't get that number off my head, 0043, something like that. I'm going to call my accountant up and see --</p><p>SIMONETTI: 0.043.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: I don't know if you guys saw this, but there was a wild wreck yesterday. Denny Hamlin did win the Daytona 500 but it was not a pretty race. Right near the end, like 20 laps to go, 21 cars in a massive crash, we've got those highlights coming up. Plus, all-star anthem, singer, songwriter Anthony Hamilton bringing down the house with his unusual performance of the National Anthem at last night's NBA all-star game. Wait until you hear it.</p><p>PAYNE: The NBA's all-star game was last night, in Charlotte, and one of the most talked about moments happened before the game even started. Jared Max is here with the highlights. Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Charles. Yes, a game with 342 points actual highlights get blurred, but one moment folks are talking about, Charlotte native Anthony Hamilton's National Anthem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY HAMILTON, SINGER AND SONGWRITER: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in the air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Anthony Hamilton's performance getting compared to Marvin Gaye's R&amp;B- like National Anthem in 1983. Back in '83, the NBA all-star game was on during the day and it was East versus West. Now, it's a Sunday night affair between two sides chosen by captains.</p><p>LeBron James' team versus Giannis Antetokounmpo, team LeBron won at 178- 164, highest scoring all-star game. Kevin Durant, the MVP, scored 31.</p><p>Daytona 500 last night, we've got to see what a 21-car pileup looks like from inside. Check out the view from Kyle Larson's vehicle. A 21-car crash with 10 laps to go, took out defending champ Austin Dillon, Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney and others. Final 20 laps of regulation, five crashes, two red flags, came down mostly to who wouldn't crash.</p><p>Denny Hamlin emerged the winner, second time in four years. Clean sweep, first, second and third for Joe Gibbs racing, one month after Joe's son, J.D., had passed away.</p><p>One day after we learned the NFL had settled its collusion grievances filed by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid. Kaepernick's attorney said he thinks within two weeks, we are going to see \"somebody step up and do the right thing.\"</p><p>Mark Geragos says besides the Panthers, it would not surprise me if Bob Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, makes a move, says that would not surprise me.</p><p>So, Colin Kaepernick playing for the Patriots, what do you think?</p><p>PAYNE: You know, they have to start looking for a new quarterback at some point. But, I think at the end of the season, there were so many teams that could have given him a look. I mean, these teams are decimated. Look at the redskins, I mean, just decimated at the quarterback position. I think a few teams give him a shot in pre-season.</p><p>MAX: He's going to get a shot now that this is all over with. Somebody's going to bring him in. Might be -- hopefully it's just one team. You don't want to see him go bouncing around. But, it's going to be put up or shut up time. And it's not easy to jump right into the speed of the NFL.</p><p>PAYNE: I remembered his last (INAUDIBLE) it wasn't that good.</p><p>MAX: You know, we always know they're in college. They jump from college to the NFL. They say that the speed is the toughest thing to get up-to- speed with.</p><p>HILSENRATH: How long has he been out of the game now?</p><p>MAX: His last -- 2016 was his last season.</p><p>CARTER: Wow.</p><p>MAX: So, he's been out a while. And all of a sudden, to step in and whatever the nuances are since he's been gone, but there are other teams, there's -- you know, maybe the Panthers has -- Eric Reid is there who he used to kneel with, with the Niners.</p><p>Cam Newton coming off shoulder surgery and then Geragos, the attorney for Kaepernick, also says one of the teams with former Patriots' coaches who are now head coaches, whether it be Miami, Detroit, or Houston, might look to bring him.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And if he comes back, does he keep kneeling?</p><p>MAX: I was just thinking about that. I would bet yes. I would think so. I mean --</p><p>PAYNE: All right. By the way, Hamlin's victory dedicated to J.D. Gibbs. That was a very touching moment</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Jared Max, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Of course, you can catch Jared's sports report on FOX News Network's 24/7, also SiriusXM 115. Still ahead, border wall funding battle, a wave of protests across the country today, in response to President Trump's declaration of a national emergency and Democrats are vowing to fight back.

Do not be alarmed. It indicates a decline, which is something blue-chips used to do back in olden times.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In classic post-triple-witching fashion, the Dow and the broad S&amp;P 500 followed up their big Friday run-up with a retreat. The witch, Wall Street's nickname for the simultaneous expiration of futures, stock options and index options, brings with it volatile swings in equity trading. The Monday after a triple-witching Friday usually runs counter to the previous session's trend, and today was no exception.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow and the S&amp;P were underwater throughout the morning and early afternoon, but from about 1 p.m. EST to 3:15 those indices enjoyed an uptrend that put the S&amp;P briefly in the plus column. Then a wave of program-driven selling hit the market and knocked the indices down, with the Dow shedding 90.18 to 8816.25 and the S&amp;P losing 3.61 to 1095.55.\u00a0</p><p>Also hurting stocks was the news that OPEC members and other oil-producing countries have agreed to slash production in an effort to boost slipsliding crude prices. Oil prices leapt $1.82 per barrel to $15.04, sending the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil-Service Index geysering 6.8% and the American Stock Exchange Oil &amp; Gas Index up 1.6%. But one index's prize often is another's poison: The Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 2.2% as airlines were shot down on the prospect of sharply higher fuel costs.\u00a0</p><p>Just as they suffered on Friday, tech stocks -- especially big tech stocks -- bounced back today. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.34 to 1792.50 and the large-cap Nasdaq 100 gained 9.75 to 1179.18, led by Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), 3Com (COMS:Nasdaq), Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) and Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq). The small-cap Russell 2000 was off 0.29 to 473.96.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's just been rotation,\" said Roy Blumberg, chief market strategist at Josephthal. \"We had triple-witching on Friday, and tech stocks went down and the rest of the market went up. Basically, the scenario still hasn't changed here: It's the end of the quarter and money managers just want to put money to work. They want to put money into the things that have been working for them.\"\u00a0</p><p>Blumberg doesn't expect the OPEC machinations to have a deep or lasting effect on the overall market, but he's among the throng on the Street seeing a continued run-up through the quarter's end and then a drop. \"I'm still in the camp that says we have a good chance of seeing a 10% correction in the second quarter,\" he said. \"My old pappy taught me that in the long run, stock prices and earnings have to have some reflection of each other. At some point you have to have the E catch up with the P.\"\u00a0</p><p>Equity volume remained robust, although down from Friday's huge levels, and breadth was negative. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,586 decliners led 1,397 advancers on 631.4 million shares. New Big Board highs topped new lows by 245 to 21. On the Nasdaq, 2,452 decliners outpaced 2,027 advancers on 738.6 million shares. New Nasdaq highs beat new lows by 214 to 52.\u00a0</p><p>The bond market recovered from modest early weakness, spurred by a Federal Reserve coupon pass. In a coupon pass, the Fed permanently injects cash into the banking system by buying bonds. The 30-year Treasury gained 9/32 to 103 14/32, its yield easing to 5.88%.\u00a0</p><p>Monday's Company Report\u00a0</p><p>By Heather MooreStaff Reporter\u00a0</p><p>(Earnings estimates from First Call; new highs and lows on a closing basis unless otherwise specified.)\u00a0</p><p>Lockheed Martin (LMT:NYSE), which fell 3/8 to 116 5/8, and Northrop Grumman (NOC:NYSE), which picked up 1/2 to 107 1/2, were unfazed by Attorney General Janet Reno's scolding. But they still couldn't come up with a way to stop the feds from filing suit against the companies' proposed $9 billion merger.\u00a0</p><p>Arguing that the deal would raise prices and reduce quality, the nation's top law official declared: \"This merger isn't just about dollars and cents. It's about winning wars and saving lives.\" Reno for best actress in a financial farce! (And Clinton for best actor in a foreign drama!

In a separate deal, Cendant also agreed to buy Britain's National Parking for $1.3 billion.\u00a0</p><p>Atlantic Richfield (ARC:NYSE) jumped 1 1/2 to 81 7/8 after Arch Coal (ACI:NYSE), which gained 1/2 to 26 15/16, said it would buy the company's Colorado and Utah coal operations and combine them with Arco's Wyoming operations.

The company said it plans to cut 150 jobs and close six stores.\u00a0</p><p>American HomePatient (AHOM:Nasdaq) jumped 1 1/2, or 7.8%, to 20 7/8 despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents per share, above the year-ago 30 cents but below the seven-analyst estimate of 37 cents.\u00a0</p><p>Banctec (BTC:NYSE) dropped 2, or 7.7%, to 23 15/16 after the company said it expected to report lower-than-anticipated first-quarter earnings because of lower revenues in its system integration business.

of America: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.voanews.com\">http://www.voanews.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  In a world first, Facebook has agreed to hand over the identification data of French users suspected of hate speech on its platform to judges, France's minister for digital affairs Cedric O said on Tuesday.O, whose father is South Korean, is one of French President Emmanuel Macron's earliest followers, and has been influential in shaping the president's thinking on Big Tech as an advisor at the Elysee palace in the first two years of Macron's presidency.The decision by the world's biggest social media network comes after successive meetings between Zuckerberg and Macron, who wants to take a leading role globally on the regulation of hate speech and the spread of false information online.So far, Facebook has cooperated with French justice on matters related to terrorist attacks and violent acts by transferring the IP addresses and other identification data of suspected individuals to French judges who formally demanded it.Following a meeting between Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, and O last week, the social media company has extended this cooperation to hate speech.\"This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,\" O told Reuters in an interview. \"It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.\"O, who said he had been in close contact with Clegg over the last few days on the issue, said Facebook's decision was the result of an ongoing conversation between the internet giant and the French administration.Since his nomination as minister in March, O has made the fight against hate speech online a key priority through regular contacts with Facebook's top executives, including founder Mark Zuckerberg.Facebook declined to comment.Strong signal\"It is a strong signal in terms of regulation,\" said Sonia Cisse, a counsel at law firm Linklaters, adding that it was a world first. </p><p>\"Hate speech is no longer considered part of freedom of speech, it's now on the same level as terrorism.\"With Facebook's latest move, France is now a clear frontrunner in the quest to regulate big social media outlets, and other platforms might follow suite, Cisse said.The discussions on how to best regulate tech giants began with a Zuckerberg-Macron meeting last year, followed by a report on tech regulation last month that Facebook's founder considered could be a blueprint for wider EU regulation.Facebook had refrained from handing over identification data of people suspected of hate speech because it was not compelled to do so under U.S.-French legal conventions and because it was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it.France's parliament, where Macron's ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4% of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their network.O also signaled his openness to seeing French startups being snapped up by larger U.S. companies, in a spite of recent measures taken by Macron's government to bolster anti-takeover rules to protect the country's strategic companies.\"My only goal is to spur the creation of a lot of companies,\" he said. \"I have no problem with the fact that some of them are bought by U.S. companies, as long as they don't have critical technology.\"Too bigThe minister is also reluctant to support the idea of breaking up companies like Facebook or Google, whose size, weight on the Internet and financial firepower have turned them into systemic players just as much as big banks.Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, and calls for a break-up of the group have intensified.\"We cannot impose very tough obligations on Western companies and dismantle them because they are very big, and not do the same thing with Chinese companies that enter the Western market,\" he said, referring to groups like Alibaba and Tencent.A graduate of France's top business school, HEC, O combines political experience - he was an aide to Dominique Strauss-Khan, like many of the tight group of \"Macron Boys\" who propelled him to power - and a stint in the private sector, at engine maker Safran.At the Elysee, he was in charge of advising Macron on the French government's vast portfolio of stakes in French companies, having to deal with hot corporate sagas such as Renault-Nissan, as well as handling relations with Big Tech.

Addabbo, Jr. sent the following statement as we wrap up our Labor Day holiday: \"It is a time to reflect on the many important contributions laborers have made to the advancement of the country, and New York in particular, such as essential workers.\" However, now with more than 1.5 million New Yorkers unemployed in July, Addabbo wants to honor other laborers around this Labor Day by promoting the need for getting employees to safely return to work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Addabbo said, \"As the country continues to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses remain partially or fully shutdown. This has caused higher-than-usual unemployment rates since March. According to New York State labor statistics for July 2020, the unemployment rate in New York City was at 19.8 percent. Between July 2019 and July 2020, the biggest industry that lost jobs across the state is the Leisure &amp; Hospitality sector, according to New York State statistics. Within that sector, job losses were greatest in accommodation and food services, showing a loss of 329,000 jobs, with the food services and drinking places being hit hardest with 256,100 jobs lost over the one-year period.</p><p> \"Restaurants and bars in New York City have been able to operate with outdoor seating, but that is not nearly enough to allow them to continue surviving this pandemic. By not allowing indoor dining \u2013 especially when just over the border into Nassau county allows it, and with the cold weather approaching \u2013 it will cripple many businesses. Our city and county continue to meet the low COVID criteria set forth by Governor Cuomo that would allow them to open their doors. We need a plan to safely bring indoor dining back so our local restaurants and bars can not only survive, but thrive again.\"</p><p> The Senator pointed out that according to the Governor, New York has witnessed over 20 straight days with an infection rate below 1 percent. It was further noted that Queens' positivity rate seven-day average was actually slightly lower than that of Nassau county.</p><p> \"This Labor Day we should honor the great strides workers have made in helping us navigate through this pandemic,\" the Senator added. \"We should also assist those who want to safely return to work and provide for their families. As long as measures can be taken to protect one's health, I believe we should implement indoor dining\u2026\"</p><p> ADDABBO LOOKS FORWARD TO CASINO REOPENINGS: \"I was thankful to learn of Governor Cuomo's decision today (September 3) to allow casinos across New York State to reopen again on September 9,\" State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Racing, Gaming and Wagering, said. \"This will result in many of the furloughed casino workers returning to their jobs and providing for their families, while permitting our residents to visit these gaming sites to safely enjoy the amenities during these difficult times. The reopening of casinos will also be an economic generator for revenue and educational funding for our state, as we deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. While this is a productive first step, I am hopeful that further guidelines and metrics can be put in place, where we can reexamine the status of the casino operations and COVID rates, possibly every two weeks, which would provide information and guidance towards the decisions on allowing additional aspects of the casinos to reopen. I look forward to seeing how we progress from here.\"</p><p> MALONEY ON POSTAL INSPECTOR GEN'S NEW REPORT: On September 3, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, issued the following statement after the Washington Post published a report from the US Postal Service Inspector General on election mail.</p><p> \"The Postal Inspector General's report released yesterday clearly shows that the Postal Service can and must do better. The report documents that the Postal Service is not following its own procedures on how election mail is logged in, processed, and cleared from its facilities.\"</p><p> ANTITRUST HEARING ON GIANARIS' ANTITRUST ACT: NYS Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris and Senator Kevin Thomas announced a hearing by the Senate Democratic Majority into the state's antitrust laws. On the heels of Congress holding its own antitrust hearings, the State Senate's hearing will take place on September 14, at 10:00 am and will investigate the rapidly changing and growing power of dominant businesses in the modern economy. The committee will receive the testimony of experts in academia, tech, and law in response to Senator Gianaris' 21st Century Antitrust Act.</p><p> Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris said, \"Our antitrust laws were written a century ago for a radically different economy and they are in desperate need of serious updates. Corporate power has reached unprecedented and dangerous levels, and we need powerful new laws to protect the public and our economy. I am pleased the Senate is holding a hearing on this critical issue and thank Senator Kevin Thomas for his partnership in this effort.\"</p><p> Senator Kevin Thomas said, \"We need to modernize our antitrust laws to meet the demands of the 21st century economy. Investigating this issue is crucial in ensuring that our economy remains competitive, innovation continues to thrive, and consumers are protected. I look forward to chairing this important hearing as we continue to fight for consumers in New York.\"</p><p> Gianaris explained that existing antitrust laws, being more than a century old and are not equipped to regulate abuses in today's world. In the meantime, market domination has led to new uncompetitive practices such as predatory pricing, and leveraging a company's dominant position to control adjacent markets. Senator Gianaris' legislation would allow the state to take action against companies engaging in these practices, as well as allow for class action lawsuits.</p><p> In July, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust held significant hearings after a lengthy investigation, bringing in the big tech CEOs from Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook to testify about their business practices.</p><p> Oral testimony will be by invitation only. A list of confirmed speakers will be available before the hearing.</p><p> ABSENTEE BALLOT PORTAL NOW OPEN FOR REQUESTS: Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced on September 1 the launch of New York's absentee ballot portal, where voters can directly request an absentee ballot for the upcoming November 3rd election. The Governor acted by Executive Order to allow any voter concerned about risk or exposure to COVID during the ongoing pandemic to request an absentee ballot.</p><p> \"As the November election approaches, we know that many voters feel vulnerable in the midst of this pandemic,\" Governor Cuomo said.\" In line with the sweeping reforms we have implemented to make it easier for New Yorkers to exercise their right to vote, today we launch the online portal through which every registered voter concerned about COVID-19 can obtain an absentee ballot. Voting is the cornerstone of democracy and we want each and every voter to feel safe and secure in the exercise of voting.\"</p><p> Last month, Governor Cuomo signed into law sweeping election reforms that will make it easier for New Yorkers to vote and be counted in November. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-law-sweeping-election-reforms#_blank\">www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-law-sweeping-election-reforms#_blank</url>) These new measures include allowing absentee ballot applications to be submitted to the Board of Elections immediately, allowing a voter to get an absentee ballot due to risk or fear of illness including COVID-19 and ensuring all absentee ballots postmarked on or before Election Day or received by the Board of Elections without a postmark on the day after the Election will be counted. Ballots with a postmark demonstrating that they were mailed on or before Election Day will be counted if received by November 10.</p><p> All registered New York Voters can request a ballot at the Board of Elections website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html#_blank\">www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html#_blank</url>). By clicking on the PORTAL, the application can be filled out completely online, instead of having to download the application form, fill it out and mail it.</p><p> The Board of Elections page notes that the USPS cannot guarantee delivery in less than 15 days, despite the deadlines. For those concerned the ballot won't be delivered in time, the absentee ballots can also be hand-delivered to an Early Voting Site, the County Board of Elections Office no later than November 3rd by 9pm, or an Election Day Poll Site, according to the NYS Board of Elections. The ballots MUST be signed, dated and sealed in two envelopes according to directions, or they won't be counted. To find your early voting poll site, call 866-VOTE-NYC or visit NYC.pollsitelocator.com/</p><p> The Governor also issued an executive order to bolster and support New Yorkers' right to vote. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-bolster-and-support-new-yorkers-right-vote#_blank\">www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-bolster-and-support-new-yorkers-right-vote#_blank</url>) The order requires county boards of elections to take concrete steps to inform voters of upcoming deadlines, be prepared for upcoming elections and help ensure absentee ballots can be used in all elections.</p><p> 'TRUMP SPREAD MISINFORMATION RE NY-12 PRIMARY': Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney's reelection campaign sent out the following statement from her, regarding statements made by President Trump in his rally in North Carolina: \"Well, it happened again last night: Donald Trump once again attacked NY-12 and our primary race\u2026Yet again, he's spewing lies to the American people \u2013 and his lies are dangerous attempts to undermine our democracy. But his effort to undermine NY-12's election isn't just an attempt to get me to stop my oversight of his corrupt administration \u2013 it's setting the stage for trying to undermine confidence in our November elections.\"</p><p> Maloney's campaign then made reference to its seven-minute campaign ad they recently released with a montage of \"Trump's lies and his NY-12 obsession,\" most of which were outlined, and refuted, below:</p><p> \"TRUMP: 'There are thousands of missing ballots.'</p><p> \"THE TRUTH: There are no missing ballots. Ballots that are initially disqualified are set aside and preserved by the Board of Elections in case there are questions later on down the line. In NY-12, between 12,000-12,500 ballots were initially disqualified, for a variety of reasons. In fact, the only ballots I would call 'missing' are those that voters never received in the first place. But if that's Donald Trump's concern, then he should be fighting with the Democrats to increase funding for the Postal Service, and roll back (all of) Postmaster General DeJoy's harmful changes.</p><p> \"TRUMP: 'Nobody knows what's happening with the ballots.'</p><p> \"THE TRUTH: Yes, we do. The primary results were certified on August 4th. And once again, Donald: there is no evidence of lost or fraudulent ballots.</p><p> \"TRUMP: 'It took six weeks to get the results!'</p><p> \"THE TRUTH: First, NYS Election Law doesn't allow the opening of absentee ballots until \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 July 1, after the \"machine canvass\" is complete\u2026As I said throughout the process, sacrificing accuracy for speed would have been unacceptable, and both my team and I were impressed by the diligence and hard work of the BOE workers who helped count every vote.</p><p> \"TRUMP: 'In New York, they have thousands of ballots, they don't know what happened to them. Is there fraud? It's a disaster!'</p><p> \"THE TRUTH: First of all, the board was very clear at the federal hearing: ballots are NEVER destroyed or thrown out. Even ballots that are ruled invalid are set aside by the board, so that if the invalidation is challenged (as happened in our race) they can be referred back to. Counting these votes may have changed the margin, but it did not affect the ultimate winner of the election. And regarding fraud, there has been no evidence of it whatsoever.</p><p> \"TRUMP: 'Nobody knows what's going on with that race and yet they declared her a winner!'</p><p> \"THE TRUTH: The Board certified this election on August 4th, and due to a lead that far surpassed the reinstated ballots, declared our campaign was victorious.</p><p> \"Lastly, as many of you have heard by now, Donald Trump urged his supporters to 'vote twice' \u2013 once in person and once by mail. Let me be very clear: In states that allow in-person voting to override an absentee ballot, this is a strategy that will yield thousands, if not millions, of disqualified votes. This will allow Donald Trump to cast doubt on the results of our Presidential Election. In states that don't, he's just encouraged his supporters to commit a felony.\"</p><p> SIMOTAS ADVOCATES FOR CHILDCARE SERVICES: Chairwoman of the Women's Issues Committee, Assembly Member Aravella Simotas attended a virtual press conference to urge Governor Cuomo to release funds for childcare resources.</p><p> The New York State government has been holding back tens of millions of dollars, allocated by the federal government for the childcare industry through the CARES Act, at a time when 25% of childcare programs and 30% of school-aged child care centers have closed due to the pandemic.</p><p> \"Childcare services must be at the forefront of New York's reopening plans. In a crippling economy, we cannot expect families to return to work without proper childcare services. New York State must invest in our childcare communities,\" said Assembly Member Simotas.</p><p> \"Now, more than ever, affordable childcare is a necessity for New York's working families. No matter their situations, whether working from home, working outside of the home, or searching for employment after losing their pre-pandemic jobs, parents and caregivers are struggling to make ends meet while balancing the care and education of their children. All too often, this burden falls on mothers, and it is an impossible task. It is unfair to ask us to choose between providing for our families and caring for (and educating) our children. And for so many, there simply is no choice. The CARES Act and all it entails is a much-needed resource for New York families and needs to be passed to help ease this burden,\" said local mom Julia Sorrentino.</p><p> \"Stable, affordable, and accessible childcare is a prerequisite for parents to return to work. We can't begin to rebuild an economy battered by the COVID-19 pandemic without the workforce of our parents. Being child-free shouldn't be a requirement for participating in the workforce, and New York State needs to support us parents and our children so we can help the economy recover,\" said Megan Stotts, Astoria resident and mother.</p><p> WELCOMES MAYOR'S DELAY OF SCHOOLS OPENING: New York State Senator John Liu, Chair of the Senate's Committee on NYC Education, stated the following in response to questions about the September 1 announcement by the mayor that the start of the school year will be delayed: \"This decision is very late, but nonetheless welcome because City Hall is finally working together with teachers, principals, and other school staff without whom the schools cannot possibly educate our kids. Many parents, students, teachers and school staff want schools to be re-opened, but done so safely. The determination that schools are safe cannot simply be a decree by Mayor de Blasio, especially given his history with his own Health Department. Thankfully there is now agreement on how to prepare for school re-opening and for ongoing cleaning and monitoring to maintain safety for schoolkids, teachers and all school staff.</p><p> \"Clearly, there's still much work to be done, and City Hall and the Department of Education must spare no effort to avoid another delay in the absence of a spike in infection rates. Education of children and livelihoods of parents are hanging in the balance.\"</p><p> CENSUS DOCUMENT: 'RISK OF SERIOUS ERRORS': On September 2, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, the Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, released a new internal Census Bureau document that warns of the risk of \"serious errors\" in the data if the Census Bureau is forced to complete its count under the current statutory deadlines.</p><p> Chairwoman Maloney conveyed the document to House and Senate leadership in a letter urging the Senate to pass legislation to extend the Census deadlines in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.</p><p> \"The Committee has now obtained an internal Census Bureau analysis from August warning that forcing the Census Bureau to complete the 2020 Census without extending the statutory deadlines could significantly degrade its accuracy and completeness,\" Rep. Maloney wrote. \"Census Bureau leaders did not produce this document to the Committee, but the Committee obtained it from another source.\"</p><p> This internal document appears to be a presentation for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on August 3, 2020\u2014the same date the Administration announced that it was cutting short follow-up operations. It proposes a severely truncated data processing schedule of only 92 days. In comparison, the past three Decennial Censuses had much longer time periods to process data and deliver apportionment counts\u2014and they were not being conducted during a global pandemic. The 1990 Census used 140 days, the 2000 Census used 185 days, and the 2010 Census used 147 days.</p><p> The document warns that this drastically reduced timeline will force the Census Bureau to curtail or entirely remove key steps developed over the past decade to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the Census:</p><p> * The document highlights the risks of the \"[h]ighly compressed schedule\" and warns that data products \"will be negatively impacted under this revised plan.\"</p><p> * It cautions that \"eliminated activities\" will \"reduce accuracy,\" that the schedule \"creates risk for serious errors not being discovered in the data,\" and that such errors \"may not be fixed\u2014due to lack of time to research and understand the root cause or to re-run and re-review one or multiple state files.\"</p><p> * Although the document says, \"we are determining full impacts,\" it warns starkly that canceling reviews by state officials will lead to \"virtually certain vocal objections.\"</p><p> The Census Bureau released a public presentation with similar information on August 17, but it omitted these warnings.</p><p> Five months ago, the Trump Administration asked Congress to pass urgent legislation to extend several key Census deadlines as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The House passed extensions on May 15 as part of the Heroes Act. Chairwoman Maloney introduced stand-alone legislation on May 27, the Fair and Accurate Census Act, and Senators Kamala Harris and Brian Schatz introduced the Senate companion on June 23. But the Senate has failed to act, and the Trump Administration suddenly reversed its position, forcing the Census Bureau to drastically curtail operations and severely jeopardizing the 2020 Census.</p><p> Committee staff also held briefings last week with three top Census Bureau officials who all agreed that providing more time would reduce the risk of an inaccurate or incomplete count. The first official stated, \"More time is always a good thing.\" The second official stated, \"Anytime you have more time it reduces risk, and that would have reduced our risk.\" When the third official was asked whether he agreed with the first two officials that \"ideally more time would be better both for data collection and data processing,\" he replied, \"Absolutely.\"</p><p> Although the officials expressed optimism about their ability to mitigate the risks of this truncated schedule, they made clear that they were forced to dramatically compress their operations because Congress has not extended the statutory deadlines.</p><p> The Committee also received a new report issued just last week by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office also warning about risks with the compressed timing of the Census, including serious concerns regarding the \"accuracy of data collected,\" the \"completeness of data collected,\" and \"data quality.\"</p><p> \"In light of this new internal document and the additional information we have obtained, it is more urgent than ever that the Senate act,\" Chairwoman Maloney wrote. \"Congress has a solemn responsibility under the Constitution to help ensure an accurate and complete count, and there is bipartisan support in the Senate for extending these deadlines.\"</p><p> GRODENCHIK'S DISTRICT LEADS IN CENSUS RESPONSE RATES: Council Member Barry S. Grodenchik's district is leading Queens and is second-highest in the rest of New York City in Census response rates. Council District 23 in Eastern Queens is number one in Census response rates in the borough and number two in New York City, according to recent Census data.</p><p> \"An accurate count is critical to the future of our city, so I have been encouraging participation in the 2020 Census across the community since last fall,\" said Council Member Grodenchik. \"I am so pleased to see strong results.\"</p><p> Census data indicate that the average Census response rate in New York City is 55%; Council District 23, which includes Bayside Hills, Bellerose, Douglaston, Floral Park, Fresh Meadows, Glen Oaks, Hollis, Hollis Hills, Holliswood, Little Neck, New Hyde Park, Oakland Gardens, and Queens Village, has a response rate of 64%, the highest in Queens, and the second highest in New York City.</p><p> The Census determines congressional representation, gives access to hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding, and affects other crucial resources for communities.</p><p> To minimize underrepresentation, an issue in the last census in 2010, Grodenchik has made Census 2020 a priority. He has joined forces with local libraries, civic associations, small businesses, schools, community boards, and the NYPD to get the word out. He has set up tabling events and workshops, offering updated information and opportunities to fill out the census onsite; he also has launched an email, text and social media campaign to encourage residents to fill out the Census online or by telephone during the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to keep people safe.</p><p> Grodenchik's recent push to get greater self-response rates, which included mobile questionnaire assistance, helped hundreds of people. The deadline for the 2020 Census is now September 30 instead of October 31, so the Council member is continuing his outreach efforts, which includes arranging for Census representatives to be on-site providing assistance at the following events:</p><p> * Face mask distribution, at Key Food, 61-46 Springfield Boulevard</p><p> * Queens County Farm Museum tour</p><p> * Senior nature walk in Alley Pond Park</p><p> The last two events are by reservation only; for more information, call 718-468-0137 or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:BGrodenchik@Council.NYC.gov\">BGrodenchik@Council.NYC.gov</email></p><p> HATCH ACT VIOLATIONS DURING GOP CONVENTION: On September 3, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations, and Committee Member Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett sent a letter asking the independent Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to investigate reports of multiple, repeated violations of the Hatch Act by the Trump Administration during the Republican National Convention last week.</p><p> \"Throughout the Convention, Administration officials repeatedly used their official positions and the White House itself to bolster President Trump's reelection campaign,\" the Members wrote. \"We are alarmed that President Trump and some senior Administration officials are actively undermining compliance with  \u2013 and respect for \u2013 the law.\"</p><p> Numerous Administration officials used their official positions and government property and resources for partisan political purposes during the Convention, including:</p><p> * Video of a pardon and naturalization ceremony with Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf and employees of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p> * A convention speech by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo while he was on official travel abroad.</p><p> * Multiple segments filmed on federal property, including President Trump speaking with former hostages and people impacted by coronavirus.</p><p> * A segment in which Department of Housing and Urban Development Regional Administrator Lynne M. Patton interviewed New York City tenants who later explained they were not aware that they would be used at the Convention.</p><p> * Vice President Mike Pence's filmed segment and Convention keynote address, raising serious questions about the use of White House employees and resources and US National Park Service's role in coordinating and executing Convention programming.</p><p> \"We are particularly concerned with the consequences of White House actions on career employees who may have felt pressured to help organize and put on these events, potentially subjecting them to legal jeopardy,\" the Members added. \"Career employees have faced severe consequences for behavior far less egregious than what the country witnessed last week.\"</p><p> Maloney noted that President Trump reportedly \"enjoyed the frustration and anger\" in response to holding Convention events on the White House grounds and \"relished the fact\" that he could not be stopped, according to President Trump's aides. He reportedly \"joked he would excuse anyone found to be violating the act on his behalf.\"</p><p> White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reportedly stated: \"Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares,\" and another Administration official explained, \"What are the consequences? No one gets punished.\"</p><p> \"As the Committee of jurisdiction over the Hatch Act, we urge you to investigate and publicly report whether any of the actions taken by Administration officials during the Convention violated the law,\" the Members concluded.</p><p> The Members requested a response to the letter by September 17.</p><p> MCCONNELL'S BILL 'LACKS CRITICAL FUNDS FOR NY': U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, standing with US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City House members Hakeem Jeffries, Adriano Espaillat, Gregory Meeks, Jerry Nadler, and Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, announced they will not support any COVID relief bill that simply acts as a \"box-check\" for Leader McConnell and President Trump's handling of the pandemic and fails to include critical funds for state and local aid along with mass transit, two now-suffering priorities important to the larger economy.</p><p> Schumer said the GOP-proposed relief bill does not include assistance for these priorities and that it won't pass the House or Senate. Schumer warned that the GOP bill is \"emaciated,\" lacking critical priories needed to truly beat back the pandemic, especially when it comes to New York's plight.</p><p> \"While the folks beside me today worked darn hard to pass the Heroes Act more than three months ago, the Senate, under Leader McConnell and the White House under President Trump, has used that time to sit on their hands, doing absolutely nothing for the benefit of the American people in the ongoing battle against the coronavirus,\" said U.S. Senator Schumer. \"Now, to add insult to injury, when forced to act because the American people are demanding they do, Leader McConnell and President Trump hand in an assignment that is incomplete, emaciated and unacceptable \u2013 it's an 'F'. And we are here today to make it very clear: this will not stand.\"</p><p> Amongst the many problems with the latest GOP COVID-19 proposal, Schumer and colleagues point out that \"it's not only a loser for New York, but it goes the extra mile to hurt New York.\" The proposal aims to exclude funds for state and local aid, as well as mass transit funds, both of which are critical to the New York economy and the American economy at-large, and two categories where New York has been hard hit by the coronavirus.</p><p> Schumer has said he was hopeful that with the highest unemployment since the Great Depression and the worst public health crisis since 1918, there could be progress made in negotiations with the White House during the month of August. But, he said, President Trump, led by Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, have embraced a hardline view that the federal government should be doing less, not more, during this time of national crisis. Based on their self-described lack of urgency, the continued division of their caucus, and this most recent inadequate proposal, Schumer says it is clear Republicans are trying to \"check the box\" and give the appearance of action rather than actually meet the truly profound needs of the American people.</p><p> In July, Republicans allowed a slew of protections that Senators Schumer, Gillibrand and the New York House delegation fought for, to expire, including enhanced unemployment benefits, renter protections and other measures aimed at ameliorating the devastation of the pandemic. According to the New York State Department of Labor, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, including more than 1.8 million New Yorkers. Schumer says figures like this prove how critical the issue of state and local aid, mass transit funds and others are to keeping families and our economy afloat.</p><p> CUOMO STOPS TAX LIEN SALE: Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James released the following statements regarding the Governor's Executive Order stopping New York City's annual tax and water lien sale in an effort to protect homeowners as the COVID-19 public health crisis continues.</p><p> \"COVID-19 caused enormous disruption in the daily lives of New Yorkers, including their ability to keep a roof over their head,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"The tax and water lien sale was delayed in May in recognition of this hardship, and given the current economic climate it makes sense to delay it again so that homeowners aren't facing further uncertainty. This measure is part and parcel with our ongoing efforts to help New Yorkers weather the ongoing public health emergency.\"</p><p> \"As the economic impacts of COVID-19 rage on, the tax lien sale puts an unnecessary financial burden on New York's homeowners, and especially communities of color,\" said Attorney General James. \"It is the responsibility of government to relieve the financial hardships of the people wherever possible, not exacerbate them. I am proud that my office worked with Governor Cuomo and his team to take immediate action to protect hardworking homeowners during this stressful time.\"</p><p> As New Yorkers are still facing significant financial burdens due to the pandemic, including these homes in the tax lien sale will only exacerbate the economic crisis and result in homeowners \u2013 mostly in communities of color \u2013 potentially losing their homes during this time.</p><p> ON POSTPONEMENT OF TAX LIEN SALE: Acting Queens Borough President Sharon Lee stated the following in response to the postponement of the tax lien sale that the city had scheduled for September 4.</p><p> \"It was simply inhumane and unjust to proceed with the 2020 New York City tax lien sale today. Thanks to intervention by Attorney General James, as well as Governor Cuomo's Executive Order today, thousands of families and homeowners \u2013 many of whom are here in Queens \u2013 are granted precious reprieve and will be able to breathe a little easier during this ongoing state of emergency. Without it, the City's untimely lien sale would have displaced families, destabilized communities and disrupted generational wealth building.\"</p><p> On Monday, August 31, Attorney General James, joined by 57 officials including Borough President Lee, urged Mayor Bill de Blasio to delay the city's annual tax and water lien sale scheduled for Sept. 4.</p><p> In a letter to the Mayor last week, Borough President Lee urged the Mayor to stop the September 4 lien sale, and expressed support for New York State Senate Bill S.8921 (introduced by Senator Leroy Comrie of Queens and supported by New York City Council Resolution 1387-2020, introduced by Councilmember Adrienne Adams), which would postpone the lien sale until one year after the currently active COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted.</p><p> Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato (D-Rockaway Beach), had sent a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) urging them to cancel this year's tax lien sale because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under normal circumstances, the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) would have conducted extensive outreach to property owners/individuals on the tax lien list, including in-person clinics to ensure that property owners understand the lien sale process and ensure that these individuals can enter into payment plans, apply for the appropriate property tax exemptions, with the eventual hope of paying off their arrears. However, due to the pandemic DOF has been unable to conduct in-person outreach events leaving thousands of property owners with little to no information and resources on how to get off the lien sale list. This year, out of the nearly 10,000 properties on the tax lien eligibility list, more than 5,000 are single-family homes.</p><p> \"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of New Yorkers have been pushed into financial disarray and uncertainty due to job and income losses, leaving many unsure of how they will continue to provide for their families or meet their overall housing expenses. Having a lien sold on their property and/or home during a global pandemic is reckless and would only further the economic strain of thousands of families throughout our city including seniors and those most susceptible to the COVID-19 virus,\" Pheffer Amato stated. \"Without appropriate outreach and information given to the public it is unconscionable for DOF to move forward with the tax lien sale as planned.\"</p><p> Pheffer Amato concluded her letter by requesting that Mayor de Blasio's office look into the possibility of canceling the tax lien sale for 2020.</p><p> MEEKS' AMERICAN DREAM DOWN PAYMENT ACT: On September 4, Representatives Gregory W. Meeks (D-NY) and Al Green (D-TX) introduced the American Dream Down Payment Act to help Americans across the country obtain the dream of home ownership. The bill would aid families throughout the nation by establishing tax-exempt savings accounts that would be instrumental for households seeking to save up for a down payment. This legislation would also help close the racial gap in home ownership rates, by providing a new tool for Black and Brown families to save up for a home of their own. A companion bill in the Senate has been introduced by Senator Doug Jones (D-AL).</p><p> \"Home ownership is the route to the middle class for tens of millions of Americans, and it is the largest financial asset most Americans own,\" said Congressman Gregory Meeks. \"This bill will provide the push, the means, and the opportunity for Americans to save for a down payment at a time when mortgage interest rates are at a historic low. By boosting the path for Black home ownership, this bill will also help close the stubborn and pernicious racial wealth gap.\"</p><p> Representative Al Green (TX-09) stated, \"When we talk about the American dream, we often hear the adage that insists people must pull themselves up by their bootstraps to attain a better quality of life. Unfortunately, many in underserved communities have neither bootstraps nor boots. The American Dream Down Payment Act provides boots, via tax-exempt savings accounts that will help people save for a down payment on a home; and with bootstraps, home loans that make homeownership more accessible. This legislation provides the boots and bootstraps necessary for many to transform the American dream into a reality. I must thank my colleague and friend Congressman Gregory Meeks for crafting this bill. I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor, and I look forward to it and its Senate companion being passed and enacted as the law of the land.\"</p><p> \"The introduction of the American Dream Down Payment Savings Act offers Black American families and individuals the opportunity to build legacy wealth through homeownership. The ability to accumulate tax-free savings funds breaks down/eliminates one of the most prominent barriers to achieving homeownership, the down payment. This Act serves as a tangible springboard to increase Black homeownership and real wealth building prospects which the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) includes in the meaning of its time-honored slogan, Democracy in Housing,\" stated Donnell Williams, NAREB National President.</p><p> ROZIC: METROCARD MOBILE COMING TO FRESH MEADOWS: Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D,WF-Fresh Meadows) announced that MTA Mobile Sales Vans will be coming to Fresh Meadows this month. The Mobile Sales Vans will be in the Fresh Meadows Shopping Center located at Horace Harding Expressway and 188th Street on Monday, September 14, and Monday, September 28 from 1:00 to 2:30PM.</p><p> \"It is oftentimes difficult for residents to access MTA services,\" said Assemblywoman Rozic, whose district does not include a single subway or train station. \"That is why I am bringing the MetroCard Mobile Van to the neighborhood to make it more convenient for commuters to talk with a trained representative about their concerns and questions.\"</p><p> Services offered include applying for the Reduced Fare Program (age 65+ or riders with qualifying disabilities); purchasing and refilling MetroCards; exchanging damaged reduced-fare MetroCards for a temporary replacement, and reporting a lost/stolen reduced-fare MetroCard. For seniors or people with disabilities applying for the Reduced Fare Program, please bring any of the following proof of age documents: birth certificate, driver's license, Medicare card, valid state ID or passport.</p><p> Rozic added, \"Now that the MTA has resumed collecting bus fares, Mobile Sales Vans will ease some of the challenges that come along with relying solely on buses to get around Queens.\"</p><p> Those stopping by to purchase a MetroCard must wear a face covering and maintain a safe physical distance. For more information, visit the MTA's Reduced Fare Program at new.mta.info/fares-and-tolls/subway-bus-and-staten-island-railway/reduced-fare-metrocard</p><p> PHEFFER AMATO SPEAKS AT PA'S SUSTAINABILITY CAMP: On August 31, Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato (D-Rockaway Beach) gave closing remarks at the Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ's Sustainability Mini Camp online. The camp was held from Monday, August 17 through Monday, August 24 for students going into 6th-8th grades. The students learned about climate change, transportation, renewable energy, and sustainability at JFK and LGA airports, along with green careers. Pheffer Amato was invited to give remarks as Chair of the JFK Redevelopment Environmental Stewardship Committee and encouraged the students to think \"green\".</p><p> \"It was great to speak to our students about the role that our local airports play in our community and environment \u2013 especially since JFK is right in our backyard,\" Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato said. \"Teaching our children about sustainability and protecting the environment is so vital to developing the next generation of climate-conscious citizens and leaders. I was honored to speak with them, and I want to thank the Port Authority and the entire JFK Redevelopment team for putting this great camp together.\"</p><p> \u2014Contributions by Annette Hanze Alberts</p><p> This column was originated by John A.

Maloney (D-NY) called on the House of Representatives to begin the impeachment process, at a rally on June 15 at Foley Square in Manhattan. \"I've been thinking about impeachment for a long time. It is not something that Congress, or our country, can undertake lightly \u2013 it's a terrible, weighty thing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"After carefully reviewing evidence laid out in the Mueller Report, after attending numerous hearings, after listening to the concerns of my constituents, and after doing as much soul-searching as I've ever done in my life, it is my inescapable conclusion that the House of Representatives must open an impeachment inquiry against the president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Just this week, the president went on national television and said that he would accept information from a foreign government in the course of the campaign, putting himself in the debt of a foreign power. He has learned nothing from the Mueller report and investigation. He has said that he will continue to stonewall any investigation and fight every subpoena, before he even sees them. He continues to put himself above the law and his own interests over the American people and our democracy.</p><p> \"I do not say this lightly. Impeachment is going to be a painful ordeal for our already divided nation. But given the evidence we've seen of numerous violations of public trust and democratic norms, our commitment to the Constitution demands our action. And the strength of our faith in the Constitution gives me hope that we will emerge stronger than before.\"</p><p> ROZIC CALLS FOR PERMANENT FUNDING OF VCF: On June 13, Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D,WFP-Fresh Meadows) announced passage of her resolution urging the United States Congress to pass the Never Forget the Heroes Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act (H.R.7062/S.3592). The bill, which is sponsored by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), was the subject of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing last week and passed out of the House's Judiciary Committee on June 12. Passage of the resolution coincides with visits from members of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association (UFOA) and Uniformed Firefighters Association (UFA) as part of their advocacy day.</p><p> Rozic, who serves as chair of the Office of State-Federal Relations, said, \"Our city's Bravest, who answered the call of duty on 9/11 and the aftermath that followed deserve better than to face uncertainty over mounting medical costs from related illnesses. As next steps are being determined in Congress to permanently fund the VCF, we remain grateful to the leadership of Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and New York's Congressional Delegation for putting first responders' voices front and center.\"</p><p> The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was first authorized in 2001 to provide compensation to first responders for losses resulting from 9/11-related illnesses and was funded through 2004. In 2011, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act was created to reauthorize funding and establish the World Trade Center Health Program \u2013 which has been permanently funded as of 2015.</p><p> It is estimated that more than 50,000 New Yorkers have registered claims through the VCF. Earlier this year it was announced that the remaining funding in the VCF is insufficient to cover pending and future claims ahead of its December 2020 expiration date.</p><p> Rozic's resolution was introduced with bipartisan support. Prior to its passage, Rozic introduced FDNY First Deputy Commissioner Laura Kavanagh on the floor of the Assembly. Kavanagh is the second woman in the agency's history to attain such rank. She began her career with the FDNY as assistant commissioner of External Affairs, where she advocated for legislation protecting first responders and spearheaded citywide fire safety programs.</p><p> Several of Rozic's colleagues, including Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato, Assemblyman Michael DenDekker, and Assemblyman Michael Cusick introduced the following members of the UFA and UFOA: Gerard Fitzgerald, president, UFA; LeRoy McGinnis, vice president, UFA; George Farinacci, vice president, UFOA; and James McCarthy, treasurer, UFOA.</p><p> COMMITTEE PASSES PERMANENT 9/11 VICTIMS' FUND: Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) celebrated committee passage of the Never Forget the Heroes Act on June 12. Reps. Maloney, Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Peter King (R-NY) introduced H.R.1327 on February 25. The bill currently has 312 bipartisan cosponsors, 81 of whom are Republicans.</p><p> \"We are going to make the VCF permanent because there is no other choice. We have a double moral obligation to our 9/11 first responders, survivors, and their families. First, to those who ran to save lives, putting others ahead of themselves. They were selflessly there for us \u2013 we now must be there for them. Secondly, to all those our government told it was safe to breathe the air, drink the water \u2013 and go back to work and school \u2013 when it wasn't. We lied to them, and now we need to do everything we can to be there for them and make their suffering less.</p><p> \"This bill is about fulfilling our promise to 'Never Forget.' And we won't stop fighting until we guarantee that this program will be there for anyone and everyone who needs it.\"</p><p> ENDORSEMENTS CONTINUE FOR KATZ FOR DA: Most recently, Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul, 1199SEIU, NYS Senator John Liu, and Congressman Adriano Espaillat announced their endorsement of Queens Borough President Melinda Katz in the race for district attorney.</p><p> Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, the highest-ranking woman elected official in New York state, announced her endorsement of Katz on June 14. Hochul joins Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, the Brooklyn-Queens and New York City chapters of the National Organization of Women, and Planned ParenthoodNYC Votes PAC in supporting Katz, a sign that Katz's platform of bringing a larger emphasis to women's rights in the DA's office is resonating across the city and state, Hochul noted.</p><p> \"Nobody is better prepared to bring criminal justice reform to Queens than Melinda Katz. Not only is she a skilled attorney, she's a dedicated public servant who knows how to build a diverse coalition to push for change better than anyone else. Melinda understands that civil rights and reforms to the justice system go hand-in-hand with public safety. Her agenda to change the DA's office will make it more responsive to the community and better equipped to protect workers, immigrants, women, and people of color. I'm proud to endorse her and look forward to seeing her become the first woman district attorney of Queens,\" said Hochul</p><p> Kathy Hochul has served the people of New York at the local, state, and federal level. In 2011 she became the first Democrat to represent the 26th Congressional District in 40 years, and made veteran's issues and economic development a top priority. As the lieutenant governor, she has spearheaded the governor's campaign against sexual assault and harassment and has co-chaired the Heroin and Opioid Abuse Task Force.</p><p> 1199SEIU, the largest healthcare worker union in the nation and one of the most powerful organizing forces in the state, representing over 450,000 healthcare workers in five states stated: \"We are proud to endorse Melinda Katz for Queens district attorney. As an attorney and public servant, she's never shied away from a tough fight against powerful interests, and she's always been deeply involved in the communities she represents. She's proven time and again that she can create change and progress by building relationships neighborhood by neighborhood across Queens. From reducing gun violence to creating an entirely new bureau dedicated to protecting workers' rights, the changes she's proposing will create a safer and more just community for everyone,\" said Gabby Seay, 1199SEIU's political director.</p><p> NYS Senator John Liu, a trailblazing progressive leader who was the first Asian-American elected to citywide office and legislative office in New York, said, \"Melinda Katz will be an exceptional district attorney. What sets her apart is a deep commitment to ensuring social and equitable justice in Queens. She has built long-standing relationships throughout the borough, and at a time when criminal justice reform is taking hold across the city, we need someone like Melinda who we can trust to deliver these reforms in Queens. She's an expert attorney who is dedicated to making change, and she'll start by diversifying the district attorney's office to better represent communities across our borough. I'm excited to endorse her and look forward to seeing her win on June 25,\" said State Senator Liu.</p><p> Liu's support for Katz is a significant endorsement, as Liu represents a large part of northern and eastern Queens.</p><p> Congressman Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican-American member of Congress and a lifelong criminal justice reform advocate, joins Councilman Francisco Moya, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., and over 300 community leaders, elected officials, and labor unions in a broad coalition of support that has generated significant momentum for Katz ahead of the June 25 election. Espaillat began his career at the NYC Criminal Justice Agency, a non-profit agency that provided pre-trial services to defendants in criminal court. Rep. Espaillat said, \"Over-policing and systemic biases in our criminal justice system have plagued communities across Queens and across our city. We need meaningful criminal justice reform, and Melinda Katz is by far the best person to deliver that necessary change to Queens. She's spent her career building relationships and trust with communities across her borough, and those personal ties will ensure that she will reform the DA's office to deliver justice for everyone in Queens. As borough president, she's stood up for immigrants against the Trump administration, helping families get free legal resources, and she'll be able to do even more for the immigrant community as district attorney. I'm proud to endorse her today.\"</p><p> Katz has received a host of endorsements from elected officials, unions, community leaders, activists, and organizations, including: the UFT, 32BJ SEIU, LIUNA Local 78, NYS Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, the borough presidents of Brooklyn and the Bronx, Congressmembers Tom Suozzi, Carolyn Maloney, and Greg Meeks, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, to name only a few.

Gianaris. \"The selected date will increase our state's allotment of delegates based on party rules.\"</p><p> This date will also entitle New York Democrats to an additional delegate bonus of 25% at their nominating convention, for a total of 327 delegates.</p><p> This will be the first presidential primary where early voting will be in place, a policy passed by the NYS Senate earlier this year.</p><p> HISTORIC RENT LAWS PACKAGE: NYS Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris voted to pass the most significant pro-tenant protection laws in the history of New York. The new rent laws, which Gianaris helped write, will make living in New York more affordable for hundreds of thousands of families.</p><p> Sen. Gianaris said, \"After years of displacement caused by rent laws that worked against them, New York's tenants finally have a seat at the table, thanks to a new Senate that is working with our Assembly partners to eagerly champion housing affordability. This sweeping legislation provides the strongest tenant protections since the rent laws were enacted decades ago and I am proud to have worked with incredible grassroots organizers to deliver this historic progress.</p><p> \"The legislation addresses a wide variety of tenant issues: it will eliminate vacancy decontrol and the vacancy bonus, extend preferential rents for the duration of a tenancy, dramatically reform MCIs and IAIs, and extend tenant safeguards statewide, among other changes. I am honored that we passed this today.\"</p><p> Video of Senator Gianaris' floor speech on rent laws is available at youtu.be/nkIdJuqlOic.</p><p> CITY COUNCIL, MAYOR ANNOUNCE FY 2020 BUDGET: City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, Finance Committee Chair Daniel Dromm, Capital Budget Subcommittee Chair Vanessa Gibson and Mayor Bill de Blasio on June 13 announced an agreement on the Fiscal Year 2020 budget. The $92.8 billion budget improves quality of life for all New Yorkers and encourages fiscal responsibility, they stated.</p><p> The Fiscal Year 2020 budget includes many of the priorities the Council pushed for in order to improve the lives of all New Yorkers, including a commitment to work towards pay parity for daycare providers, fair funding for parks, increased resources for libraries, summer youth programs, and trash collection.</p><p> \"The FY 2020 budget is a progressive and responsible budget that truly delivers for all New Yorkers. From increases in funding for our parks and LGBTQ community services to an allocation for additional school social workers, this is a budget in which we can all take pride.  It is a statement of our priorities and helps ensure that all of our constituents, particularly the most vulnerable, are protected and served.  By adding $250 million to city reserves, the FY 2020 budget helps NYC weather any downturn in the economy that might come our way,\" said Councilman Dromm.</p><p> The FY2020 budget will include:</p><p> * Establishing pay parity for Early Childhood Education providers: Early childhood educators at community-based organizations (CBO) historically get paid far less than the rest of their DOE counterparts. The pay difference in some cases is as much as $35,000.</p><p> * Establishing pay parity for public defense providers and district attorneys.</p><p> * Expanding the staffing of the Office of Hate Crimes.</p><p> * Expanding reserves with a $250 million allocation.</p><p> * Launching a 2020 Census campaign by launching a major outreach effort.</p><p> * Expand foster care programming.</p><p> * Expand the Comprehensive After School System of New York City (COMPASS).</p><p> * Restore School's Out New York City (SONYC).</p><p> * Add slots for the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP).</p><p> * Increase social workers in schools.</p><p> * Restore funding for breakfast in the classroom.</p><p> EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR NY'ERS WITH DISABILITIES: NYS Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato (D-South Queens) announced that she voted to pass a series of bills to help New Yorkers with disabilities lead full, independent lives by ensuring access to critical resources, expanding disability rights and encouraging more job opportunities. The legislative package was passed in recognition of this year's Legislative Disabilities Awareness Day on May 29.</p><p> * People with disabilities face numerous financial burdens and to help manage these costs, the New York Achieving a Better Life Experience (NY ABLE) Program allows New Yorkers with disabilities and their families to save money in tax-advantaged accounts without impacting their eligibility for federal benefit programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.</p><p> * The Assembly's legislative package also includes measures to fight discrimination, including a bill that would waive the state's sovereign immunity with regard to application of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as they apply to the protection of state employees (A.1092).</p><p> * Further, the legislative package includes measures to reestablish the Office of Advocate for People with Disabilities (A.4737); and require public officers and bodies to provide interpreters and assistive listening devices for deaf or hard of hearing individuals at public hearings under certain conditions (A.3385-A).</p><p> * To support New Yorkers with disabilities on their higher education journey, the Assembly legislation includes a bill that would reauthorize the current law that requires publishers or manufacturers of printed instructional materials for college students to provide them in electronic formats (A.7251) at a cost comparable to the printed version.</p><p> * The legislative package includes a measure that would require the state Board of Elections to post a copy of a sample ballot, including electronically for use with a computer screen-reading program, on its website prior to each election as soon as the relevant information becomes available (A.163).</p><p> *  To ensure New Yorkers with disabilities are protected in case of an emergency, the Assembly passed a measure that requires counties with local emergency management plans to maintain a confidential registry of people of all ages with disabilities who may require evacuation assistance and shelter during a disaster (A.3923).</p><p> * Many individuals with disabilities are faced with discrimination and the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is more than twice the rate of those without a disability. To help level the playing field, the Assembly passed a measure that would establish a small-business tax credit for the employment of people with disabilities (A.7475).</p><p> * To strengthen services for those with disabilities, the Assembly passed measures ensuring public assistance and health care meet diverse needs: requiring local social services districts, after considering certain factors, to give controlling weight to a recipient/applicant's regular physician's opinion when determining potential work limitations or exemptions due to a disability (A.4236); and requiring the Commissioner of Health to maintain specific reimbursement and billing procedures within Medicaid for complex rehabilitation technology (CRT) products and services to ensure that payments permit adequate access for patients (A.7492). CRTs include customized wheelchairs</p><p> * The Assembly legislation also includes a bill that would create a tax credit for either new or retrofitted principal residences that are universally designed to be accessible and adaptable housing (A.2493).</p><p> GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN DISABILITY INSURANCE: NYS Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris announced that the NYS Senate passed his legislation (S.3664A) outlawing gender discrimination in disability insurance policies. Currently, gender is a determinative factor in insurance premiums. Gianaris' legislation would prohibit insurers from using gender as a tool to determine risk. Last month, Gianaris met with women small business owners in Long Island City to discuss the bill.</p><p> \"Small businesses should not be penalized for hiring female employees and this proposal would level the playing field for women in the workplace,\" said Sen. Gianaris. \"The deck is already stacked against women in the job market and I am proud the Senate passed my legislation to make things fairer.\"</p><p> Gianaris' legislation bans insurers from charging different rates based on the insured person's gender. Doctor Disability, a leading brokerage of disability insurance for the medical field, has stated it can cost up to 50% more to insure a female employee than a male. Small businesses in Queens have said it costs up to three times more to provide this insurance to women than men. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed similar legislation in January.</p><p> \"To dismantle structural sexism we need to change the perception and, in this case, the reality that women cost more to employ than men. My business employed approximately 45 women last year and 7 men, and it burned me to pay that bill \u2013 signing a check and an agreement with an insurance company to support discrimination in my workplace,\" said Sheila Lewandowski, executive director of the Chocolate Factory Theater. \"If we allow insurance companies to charge more to cover women for disability or any insurance we are, as a society telling businesses that it is cheaper to hire men than women. That is structural sexism. It is discrimination. Charging more to cover women for disability insurance is a remnant of a time when women could not even get a loan without a man signing for them. I am thrilled the Senate stood up for women and small businesses and I thank Senator Gianaris for his leadership on this issue.\"</p><p> MALONEY BILL INCREASES CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY: Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), chair of the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, on June 13 introduced the Diversity in Corporate Leadership Act of 2019, to ensure that investors and the public have the information they need about the gender, racial, and ethnic diversity of corporate boards.</p><p> The bill requires public companies to disclose the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of their boards of directors every year in their proxy statements that they send to shareholders and investors and creates a Diversity Advisory Group to study the issue and recommend strategies and best practices to increase diversity on corporate boards.</p><p> \"I strongly believe that by requiring companies to take a real look at the gender, racial, and ethnic makeup of their boards, we will create incentives and inspire change so that these boards better resemble the American public at large. By disclosing this information to investors, we are also empowering shareholders to support companies that embody their ideals and pull investment from those that don't. Beyond making moral and common sense, more diversity also makes financial sense. Studies have repeatedly found that companies with more diverse leadership are better positioned to succeed. Why wouldn't companies want to show off that they're making smart financial decisions by moving towards more diversity and equality on their boards?\"</p><p> PUBLIC CHARGE RULE DENIES BENEFITS TO IMMIGRANTS: On June 12, Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY) spoke at a press conference on Capitol Hill condemning the Trump administration's proposed rule to limit immigrants from using public benefits. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) proposed public charge rule would have dire consequences for immigrant communities, forcing families to choose between maintaining their legal immigration status and daily necessities such as food, healthcare and housing.</p><p> \"Taking away life-saving essential programs for immigrants and their children would be callous and despicable,\" said Congresswoman Meng. \"As a nation enriched by our immigrant communities, we must continue to support their access to basic necessities. I have sent letters to the administration urging them to rescind the proposed rule and I've spoken out against it. It is inhumane to punish law-abiding immigrants (by denying access to) critical safety net programs like SNAP, housing assistance, and Medicaid \u2013 benefits to which they are legally entitled. I will continue to fight against this ugly proposed rule.\"</p><p> Meng has repeatedly advocated against the proposed rule changes. After the changes were announced last year, she sent a letter to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in November 2018, and another letter in December 2018.</p><p> CUOMO GREENLIGHTS LICENSES FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED: Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the Green Light Bill on June 17 allowing undocumented New Yorkers to apply for a standard state driver's license. The Assembly passed the bill on June 13 and the Senate passed it on the evening of June 17 amid cheers.</p><p> Governor Cuomo signed the bill into law after assurances by the state solicitor general there were sufficient safeguards to prevent federal authorities from accessing the DMV database. NYS Attorney General Letitia James who oversees the solicitor general said Monday night she reviewed the bill and found there are safeguards to prevent that from happening, according to reports. The governor's signature makes New York the 13th state to authorize drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants.</p><p> \"This legislation, known as the Green Light bill, would improve road safety, raise revenue and boost the economy. It should also be noted that, contrary to fear-mongering from opponents, this legislation does not allow for voting,\" said Assemblyman Michael DenDekker (D-Jackson Heights) who helped pass the bill. \"Regardless of where you were born, every resident of my community should be able to earn the right to operate a motor vehicle, provided that they pass the written test and the road test. While New York City has one of the best mass transportation systems in the country, not every area of our state is as transportation-friendly.\"</p><p> A recent poll released by Siena College showed more than 50 percent of New Yorkers surveyed were against allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses.</p><p> MALONEY'S ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ACT PASSES: On June 12, the House Committee on Financial Services voted to pass Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney's (D-NY) Corporate Transparency Act out of committee. Maloney has been working for over a decade to pass legislation to crack down on anonymous shell companies and the use of NYC properties as bank accounts instead of homes, which drives up home prices for all New Yorkers.</p><p> Rep. Maloney said \"I am tired of money launderers using NYC apartments as bank accounts and driving up home prices for New Yorkers. My bill, the Corporate Transparency Act, will crack down on anonymous shell companies and help to stop this practice by requiring companies to disclose their true, benefiting owners \u2013 the people who actually own the LLC \u2013 when the company is formed.</p><p> \"This bill is also critical for our national security, because it finally allows law enforcement to track the money that terrorist groups use to finance their operations. Disrupting terrorist financing networks should be one of our top priorities, but right now, terrorist groups can easily hide their money using anonymous shell companies. That is completely unacceptable. And its not just terrorists \u2013 far too many criminal networks can legally hide and launder their money legally here in the US. We should all be outraged that human traffickers, gun rings, and drug cartels are skirting the law because we allow these shady practices.</p><p> \"The Corporate Transparency Act is one of the most important bills our committee will consider this Congress and I am thrilled that so many members of the committee agree with this and voted to pass the bill. I'm hopeful that this bill will pass the House like it did in the committee-with a bipartisan vote.\"</p><p> SCHUMER URGES FAA REQUIRE BLACK BOXES FOR CHOPPERS: On the heels of the Midtown helicopter crash in Manhattan on June 10, and with new safety concerns across Long Island, US Senator Charles Schumer is citing the lack of a black box, also known as a flight data recorder (FDR), as cause for serious concern for the ongoing investigation, while also revealing that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been trying for years, without success, to compel the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to mandate the installation of these often critical data preservers on many helicopter models. Schumer urged the FAA on June 16 to heed the longstanding recommendations of the NTSB and get to work on a plan to see them installed as a basic safety feature.</p><p> \"[I]n the name of safety, the FAA must take another look at the NTSB's reports on chopper crashes similar to the one in New York City just last week and propel the safety measures that have been collecting dust for far too long,\" said Sen. Schumer.</p><p> As early as 2013, the NTSB had implored the FAA to mandate the installation of flight data recorders and a cockpit voice recorder in \"all newly manufactured turbine-powered, non-experimental, non-restricted-category aircraft that are not equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder.\" In later years, the NTSB also urged installation in all existing variations of similar helicopters, as well. Either way, Schumer points out, the recommendations have not been followed.</p><p> A major crash that first spurred the NTSB to urge action in this area occurred in 2011.</p><p> According to the NTSB, \"The 'black box' onboard an aircraft records many different operating conditions of the flight. By regulation, newly manufactured aircraft must monitor at least 88 important parameters such as time, altitude, airspeed, heading, and aircraft attitude. In addition, some flight data recorders or FDRs can record the status of more than 1,000 other in-flight characteristics that can aid in the investigation. The items monitored can be anything from flap position to auto-pilot mode or even smoke alarms.</p><p> Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have proven to be valuable tools in the accident investigation process. They can provide information that may be difficult or impossible to obtain by other means.</p><p> As for why the FAA has not moved on this issue, Schumer explained the agency has said they cannot find a positive cost-benefit to requiring these kinds of devices on helicopters. Schumer disagrees with this stance, and points to the recent New York City crash and concerns across Long Island as reasons for the FAA to act.</p><p> On Monday, June 10, Tim McCormack died when the helicopter he piloted for American Continental Properties crashed on the rooftop of a building in Midtown Manhattan. McCormack was the only person on board the privately owned Agusta A109E helicopter and no other people were injured or killed in the crash, according to local law enforcement officials. The helicopter took off from the East 34th Street Heliport around 1:30 pm, at a time when the city was experiencing heavy rain, wind and poor visibility. The pilot did not have an instrument rating, which would permit him to fly in such poor weather, the FAA said.</p><p> Schumer explained that the National Transportation Safety Board is in the midst of investigating last week's crash in Manhattan, an investigation Schumer helped spur, which could take as long as two years to complete, as reported by CNN. A preliminary report will be released in two weeks but will not shed any light on what caused the tragic crash. According to an NTSB investigator, the helicopter did not have a black box on board and the pilot never communicated with air-traffic control, neither of which was required. Investigators continue to look for other recording devices that were aboard the aircraft but gathering evidence is difficult considering the location of the crash and the post-crash fire.</p><p> MALONEY: BAN NON-ESSENTIAL CHOPPERS FROM MANHATTAN: Following news reports that a helicopter crashed onto the roof of the AXA Equitable building located at 787 7th Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, sparking a two-alarm fire, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (NY-12), who represents the area in Congress, issued the following statement:</p><p> \"New York City experienced yet another deadly helicopter crash, this time, with our nightmare of having a helicopter crash into a building. It appears that the pilot was killed and no one else was seriously injured \u2013 but this pilot's death is one too many. We cannot rely on good fortune to protect people on the ground. It is past time for the FAA to ban unnecessary helicopters from the skies over our densely packed urban city. The risks to New Yorkers are just too high.\"</p><p> The AXA Equitable building was not equipped with a helipad.</p><p> On March 22, 2018, Congressmembers Carolyn B. Maloney and Jerrold Nadler led a group of their New York and New Jersey colleagues in voicing their continued opposition to helicopter tourism in light of the March 11, 2018 helicopter crash in New York City's East River that killed five passengers</p><p> In response to a 2007 report by the National Transportation Safety Board on the October 2006 plane crash on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Maloney urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to permanently prohibit aircraft from flying over the East River.</p><p>New York banned helicopters from landing on rooftops following a 1977 crash into the Pan Am Building (now called the Met Life Building).</p><p> BILL TO STUDY AIRPORT NOISE AND HEALTH IMPACT PASSES SENATE: The New York State Senate passed legislation (S.5855) co-sponsored by NYS Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. which mandates New York state study the environmental, noise and human health impacts caused by runways, including new runways, and air traffic at John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.</p><p> \"Communities in areas around JFK and LaGuardia Airports have experienced a declining quality of life as a result of noise pollution and possibly other ill effects from air traffic patterns,\" said Sen. Addabbo. \"Noise complaints in affected neighborhoods have skyrocketed due to changing air traffic patterns and too many planes flying on low approaches to these airports. Through this study, we hope to develop a comprehensive plan to address these issues so the neighborhoods can experience a better quality of life now and in the future.\"</p><p> As a result of the changing air traffic patterns and low approaching planes, communities in Nassau and Suffolk counties and parts of New York City experience a near-constant and deafening noise level that studies have shown is significantly above the day-night average noise level of 6 decibels. Currently, decibel levels are calculated using an average per day system, which doesn't accurately portray the extreme noise created by planes exceeding those threshold levels on a daily basis. This bill will require DEC to monitor noise levels experienced in 2020 and 2021 with particular attention to the impact of pollution and emissions on the life, health and property values of residents living adjacent to flight paths.</p><p> The bill was delivered to the Assembly for consideration.</p><p> CUOMO SUPPORTS SURROGACY, BAN ON GAY AND TRANS PANIC DEFENSE: Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced on June 13 that 12 members of the New York congressional delegation joined his growing campaign to legalize surrogacy and ban the \"gay and trans panic\" legal defense before the end of session on June 19. Both bills were proposed in the governor's FY 2020 Executive Budget but were not adopted by the legislature, leaving them to be considered outside of the budget during the remainder of the legislative session. The congressional delegation members joined the governor's coalition on June 13, following a rally the day before at the LGBT Community Center where the governor was joined by several LGBTQ advocacy groups, along with Bravo TV producer and host, Andy Cohen. On May 30, the governor launched a campaign and website dedicated to passing the two proposals before the end of session.</p><p> \"New York State is the progressive capital of the nation and in these divisive times we must continue to lead with bold action that promotes acceptance and equality,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"The status quo on surrogacy and the gay and trans panic defense is repugnant to our values and with this growing campaign we are sending a clear message to lawmakers: inaction is unacceptable \u2013 pass the bills now.\"</p><p> Gestational surrogacy provides same-sex couples and couples struggling with fertility the ability to conceive a child with the help of medical advances in assisted reproduction. Current state laws not only ban gestational surrogacy, but also fail to clearly define who the legal parents are when a child is conceived via reproductive technology. To broaden the inclusivity of New York's reproductive health laws, the Governor proposed legislation in the FY 2020 Executive Budget to lift the ban on surrogacy contracts that would also ensure protections for all parties involved.</p><p> Current gay and trans panic defenses allow those responsible for violent crimes against LGBTQ people to receive a lesser sentence, and in some cases, even avoid being convicted, by placing the blame on a victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity due to a loophole in state law.</p><p> Rep. Carolyn Maloney said, \"No one should have to leave their home to start a family because of New York's antiquated surrogacy laws. That is long overdue to fix. It is also absolutely ridiculous that anyone can still claim gay or trans 'panic' as a defense for assaulting someone. It has been an outrageous, hateful defense and should have been eliminated years ago. The legislature right now can legalize gestational surrogacy and ban these homophobic defense claims. It can right wrongs that have plagued the state for decades. I thank Governor Cuomo for his continued support of the LGBTQ community.\"</p><p> Representatives Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng and Nydia Velazquez also released statements in support.</p><p> Throughout his administration, Governor Cuomo has been a champion of LGBTQ rights, most notably passing the Marriage Equality Act in 2011. Earlier this year, the Governor signed the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, prohibiting employers, educational institutions, landlords, creditors, and others from discriminating against individuals on the basis of gender identity or expression, and making offenses committed on the basis of gender identity or expression hate crimes under New York State law. The Governor also signed legislation banning the practice of conversion therapy by expanding the definition of professional misconduct for professions licensed under the education law to include engaging in conversion therapy with a patient under the age of eighteen years.</p><p> Most recently, in anticipation of the potential rollback of critical Affordable Care Act provisions, Cuomo directed the Department of Health to issue regulations prohibiting health care providers from discriminating against transgender patients, and directed the Department of Financial Services to issue regulations expanding anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals when accessing health insurance. These directives were in direct response to the Trump administration's proposal to repeal a federal regulation that clarifies that the Affordable Care Act's non-discrimination protections based on sex include protections based on gender identity. By removing these protections, approximately 90,300 transgender New Yorkers would be exposed to unfair, blatant and unlawful discrimination.</p><p> In direct response to the federal government's rollbacks on federal protections for transgender students in 2017, the Governor directed the State Education Department to issue a directive to school districts reinforcing the protections from discrimination and harassment afforded to transgender students under New York State law.</p><p> GIANARIS, SENATE MAJORITY PROTECT LGBTQ: NYS Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris announced on June 11 that he and the Senate majority passed legislation that will provide greater protection and services for New York's LGBTQ community. The bills advanced by the Senate Democratic Majority will establish the Modern Family Act, abolish the use of \"gay or trans panic\" as a defense, and create the transgender youth and young adult suicide prevention task force. The Senate majority will also pass the New York State Restoration of Honor Act that will correct the records of veterans discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation.</p><p> Sen. Gianaris said, \"In New York state, love always wins. I was honored to cast one of the deciding votes for marriage equality and continued to fight for full equality earlier this session when we passed GENDA and a ban on conversion therapy. Now we proudly march through Pride Month with an additional ambitious agenda to make New York fairer for the LGBTQ community.\"</p><p> The historic legislation passed by the Senate Democratic majority includes:</p><p> * The Modern Family Act: This bill, S.2071, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman, will lift the existing ban on genetic surrogacy and provide clear and decisive legal procedures to ensure children born through assisted reproduction and surrogacy have secure and legally recognized parental relationships with their intended parents.</p><p> * Abolishing \"Gay Panic\" Defense: This bill, S.3293, sponsored by Hoylman, will limit the use of extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense, commonly known as the \"gay panic\" or \"trans panic\" defense, to a charge of murder in the second degree.</p><p> * LGBTQ Suicide Prevention Task Force: This bill, S.6315, sponsored by Senator Julia Salazar, will establish the LGBTQ Youth and Young Adult Suicide Prevention Task Force to examine, evaluate, and determine how to improve mental health and suicide prevention for New York's LGBTQ youth and young adults up to the age of 24.</p><p> * NYS Restoration of Honor Act: This bill, S.45-B, sponsored by Hoylman, will restore eligibility for state programs and benefits for LGBTQ veterans and veterans with certain qualifying conditions who were less than honorably discharged from military service due solely to their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or those who received less than honorable discharges as a result of military sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, or post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p> * Gender Identity Data: This bill, S.6321, sponsored by Senator Kevin Thomas, will require the collection of additional demographic information for an improved understanding of the diversity of the state's LGBTQ community and its needs and experiences.</p><p> Senator Gianaris has been a staunch advocate of the LGBTQ community his entire time in office, including serving as a decisive vote in support of marriage equality in 2011.</p><p> STRINGER CALLS ON ASSEMBLY TO LEGALIZE SURROGACY: NYC Comptroller Scott M. Stringer called on the NYS Assembly to legalize surrogacy in New York state: \"New York is supposed to lead the way when it comes to equality and progressive values. But when it comes to gestational surrogacy, New York's laws are antiquated, out of step with our progressive spirit, and downright wrong. The status quo inexplicably forces LGBTQ+ and infertile couples who dream of raising a family in New York to leave the state to go through the surrogacy process. This is discriminatory and it comes at a massive cost to New Yorkers, personally and financially.</p><p> \"The greatest joy in my life is being a parent, and we need to help all New Yorkers have options to choose when, if, and how to become parents themselves. The legislation advanced by Governor Cuomo would be a game-changer. It would provide New Yorkers the ability to start families through gestational surrogacy and bring New York's laws into the 21st century, along with 47 other states. The Senate, and Senator Brad Hoylman in particular, deserve credit for passing this bill \u2013 and the Assembly has only a few days left to follow suit. This is about fairness and making the dream of raising a family reality for more New Yorkers. Equality cannot wait \u2013 the Assembly must act.\"</p><p> LGBT CAUCUS STATEMENT ON DEATH AT RIKERS: The NYC Council LGBT Caucus released the following statement on Layleen Polanco's death on Rikers Island: \"Our hearts go out to Layleen Polanco's family in the wake of this terrible tragedy. Polanco was held on two low-level misdemeanor charges. Given that Polanco posed no threat to the public, it is outrageous that she was incarcerated at Rikers Island. To make matters worse, Polanco was caged away for at least 17 hours every day, for almost 60 days before she died \u2013 even though she suffered from violent seizures and should have been closely monitored. Many questions remain unanswered but this much is clear: Polanco is the latest casualty of the cancer that is Rikers Island. Rikers remains a hazardous place for the incarcerated. Conditions are particularly horrendous for transgender individuals who are forced to contend with a broken system that simply cannot keep them safe. The administration must close Rikers and issue a thorough report on Polanco's untimely death. There must be #JusticeForLayleen.\"</p><p> MENG TO POMPEO: LET THE PRIDE FLAG FLY: On June 11, Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY), a vice chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing concern about the State Department's rejection of requests by US Embassies to fly rainbow flags in honor of LGBT Pride Month. Meng's letter urges the State Department to reverse its position and immediately allow Pride flags to be flown.</p><p> \"The Trump administration's quiet efforts to undermine America's international support for LGBT rights is deeply discomforting and sends the wrong message to LGBT Americans about our moral compass,\" said Rep. Meng. \"June is LGBT Pride Month and it is a time to reaffirm our commitment to LGBT rights at home and abroad. Simple acts of solidarity, such as flying the Pride flag, demonstrate our resolve to be a beacon of hope for those who reside in hostile environments for LGBT individuals. We shouldn't backtrack on LGBT rights; we should march forward and pursue efforts that strengthen LGBT rights at home and abroad. Mr. Secretary, let the Pride flag fly proudly at all US Embassies!\"</p><p> STAVISKY BILL PROTECTS IMMIGRANT COLLEGE STUDENTS: The Senate passed NYS Senator Toby Ann Stavisky's bill to prevent the City University of New York (CUNY) and the State University of New York (SUNY) from asking about a student's immigration status. The purpose of this legislation, S.2550, is to prevent the federal government from deporting immigrant students.</p><p> \"By prohibiting CUNY and SUNY from determining if a student is from a specific Muslim-majority nation, or whether a student has proper immigration status, we reaffirm our commitment to all students,\" Senator Stavisky stated. \"Schools should be a safe haven for everyone, regardless of their immigration status,\" she concluded.</p><p> Assemblywoman Nily Rozic is the Assembly sponsor of S.2550, which can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s2550\">www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s2550</url></p><p> GIANARIS' GUN ORIGIN REGISTRY BILL PASSES: NYS Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris announced the Senate passed his legislation (S.4442-A) mandating the state's Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) establish a database tracking the state and county of origin of guns used in crimes in New York. This proposal would tackle the \"iron pipeline,\" whereby guns purchased in states with lax gun laws are brought into New York and used in crimes.</p><p> \"Stopping the iron pipeline is possible if New York leads the way. Despite having among the toughest gun laws in the country, our state experiences too many gun-related crimes due to firearms originating elsewhere,\" said Sen. Gianaris \"While the federal government will not take action to combat gun violence, New York should use data to expose states that are part of the problem. I am pleased the Senate has passed this crucial legislation today (June 11).\"</p><p> \"We applaud the Senate for passing Senator Gianaris's iron pipeline bill to thwart illegal gun trafficking and protect the lives of New Yorkers,\" said Rebecca Fischer, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. \"New York state has some of the strongest gun safety laws in the country, but firearms trafficked from weak gun law states continue to cause senseless tragedy. This legislation will strengthen New York's capacity to track the origin of guns (used criminally) and prevent them from flowing into our communities.\"</p><p> \"We know that the systems used to protect New Yorkers are only as good as the information that goes into them,\" said June Rubin, New York Chapter of Moms Demand Action. \"We're grateful to lawmakers for strengthening the safeguards to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them.\"</p><p> Senator Gianaris' bill requires DCJS and the New York State Police to publish a quarterly report about the origins of guns used in crimes. According to a 2015 analysis by The New York Times, two-thirds of guns used in crimes in New York were imported from other states.</p><p> KOO APPOINTED CHAIR OF PARKS COMMITTEE: NYC Councilman Peter Koo released the following statement upon his appointment to the chair of the NYC Council Committee on Parks and Recreation: \"I am thrilled at my appointment to the chair of the NYC Council Committee on Parks and Recreation. From the world famous Central Park to local treasures like Kissena Park, New York City's parks serve as places of refuge for every community in the five boroughs where residents and visitors can enjoy the benefits of the natural world. As the representative of over 350 acres of parkland in Council District 20, I know firsthand just how important it is to ensure every park and playground serves its residents as a safe space for recreational opportunities, programs, and activities.</p><p> \"I look forward to building on our city's legacy as steward to the greatest green spaces in the world. I'd like to thank Speaker Corey Johnson and Queens Delegation Chair Karen Koslowitz for their tremendous leadership in the Council and for their partnership in ensuring our parks in every borough receive their fair share.\"</p><p> ADDABBO, PHEFFER AMATO: MTA REPRIEVES BUSINESSES ON BEACH 116TH ST: This month, NYS Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. and Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato held a conference call with the governor's office and the MTA to discuss the future of several businesses along Beach 116th Street in the Rockaways, which have month-to-month leases with the MTA.</p><p> Last month, Addabbo and Pheffer Amato penned a joint letter to the MTA, asking that they allow the businesses \u2013 including Last Stop Gourmet Shop, Joseph A. Otton Tax &amp; Accounting, Beach Cleaners and Tailors, and A&amp;J Jewelry \u2013 to remain in their buildings on Beach 116th Street as they open up the Request For Proposal (RFP) process to find new tenants.</p><p> In response to the letter, the MTA alerted the elected officials during the conference call that the RFP process will not begin until the first quarter of 2020, so the MTA will try to work out an agreement with their current tenants, possibly allowing their businesses to stay there in the Rockaways. The MTA has also asked for contacts to the local Chamber of Commerce or other community organizations to include them in future discussions regarding the RFP process.</p><p> \"It is promising to see the MTA respond the way they did to our letter. No one wanted to see these businesses have to uproot themselves from the community they call home without having any say,\" Sen. Addabbo said. \"Now, they have the chance to work out an agreement with the MTA. Although nothing is guaranteed, what this does is give our local businesses the chance to have their voices heard, and I appreciate the MTA for working with us in attempting to resolve this local business issue.\"</p><p> \"As I've said countless times: Small businesses are the backbone of Rockaway and South Queens. I commend the MTA for hearing our concerns, and for continuing the discussion with our businesses on Beach 116th Street so that they can remain a community staple,\" said Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato. \"While we still have work to do, this is the first step in ensuring that the RFP process reflects the unique needs and challenges of our community. I look forward to working with the MTA and Senator Addabbo.\"</p><p> ADDABBO, LIBRARY CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY: In May, the community celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Queens Public Library Glendale Branch's temporary location at Atlas Park.</p><p> In 2018, as the Glendale library branch on Myrtle Avenue was preparing to undergo much-needed renovations, NYS Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr.'s office played an integral part in bringing the Queens Public Library into Atlas Park.</p><p> \"With the Glendale branch about to be shut down for renovations, I didn't want to leave the people of Glendale without the full services of a library for an extended period of time,\" said Sen. Addabbo, adding that although a mobile library branch was planned for Glendale while the branch was closed, he didn't believe it would sufficiently serve Glendale. \"I am so glad to see that the temporary space is being utilized by the public and I would like to thank Queens Public Library, Atlas Park, and everyone involved in making this happen.\"</p><p> According to Queens Public Library, between May 2018 and April 2019, the temporary location saw 69,411 people use the facility. The space held 314 programs \u2013 including several story time programs outside on Atlas Park's lawn \u2013 which were attended by 2,186 children. On top of that, the location has been signing up many new customers, especially on Saturdays.</p><p> \"Since opening its doors a little over a year ago, our temporary Glendale space has thrived, becoming an indispensable resource for local residents and a popular destination among shoppers visiting the mall,\" said Queens Public Library President and CEO Dennis M. Walcott. \"We are grateful to State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo and Atlas Park for making it possible for Queens Public Library to continue serving the community while the Glendale branch is undergoing renovations.\"</p><p> \"The Shops at Atlas Park focuses on family-friendly opportunities which has made it a perfect temporary location for Queens Borough Public Library during renovations,\" said Peter DeLucia, property manager of The Shops at Atlas Park. \"They have been wonderful partners and we hope our relationship will continue after they go back to their former location on Myrtle Avenue.\"</p><p> TRANSPARENT BILLING SOFTWARE TASK FORCE: NYC Councilman Peter Koo introduced on June 13 Intro. 1602, legislation that would create a task force to study the feasibility of using transparent billing software by city agencies to hold vendors accountable for all work done by computer.</p><p> Transparent billing software is defined as software designed to permit the user to verify the accuracy of time billed for work performed on a computer, whether through keystroke and mouse event tracking, screenshots or other functions that have an auditing purpose.</p><p> The bill comes on the heels of reports of expensive delays, cost overruns and overcharges in several multimillion dollar technology contracts.</p><p> Recently it was reported that the city was overcharged at least $16 million for a contract to build an electronic procurement system.</p><p> In April, reports highlighted cost overruns in the NYCWiN contract amounting to $55.1 million.</p><p> The CityTime scandal began as a $63 million contract to build a citywide time-keeping system, but contractors were not appropriately tracked, resulting in a scheme that ballooned to more than $700 million and several arrests.</p><p> Councilman Koo stated, \"The City of New York has spent billions of dollars on technology contracts, but we have seen too many examples where deliverables are not met, either through costly delays or even outright fraud \u2013 as was the case in the infamous CityTime contract that came in 10 times over budget. We must increase oversight of these big tech contracts to ensure absolute accountability for delays, cost overruns, overcharges, waste, fraud, and abuse. The creation of a task force is the first step toward understanding how different agencies oversee and audit their contracts and contractors, and it will bring us one step closer to the goal of ensuring all work done by city contractors on computers is monitored, evaluated, and audited.\"</p><p> ADDABBO BILL TO COVER WASTE TRAINS PASSES SENATE: Legislation sponsored by NYS Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. to require hard lids or sturdy tarping on top of \"trash trains\" has been approved by the NYS Senate. Sen. Addabbo said, \"For years now, many of my constituents have complained of terrible odors and spilled garbage from trains carrying waste through their communities. When trains loaded down with waste sit for a long time on the tracks at transfer stations, it has negative ramifications for the public health, our environment and local property values. My bill would help to address these issues by requiring that trash being transported by rail be contained more completely and effectively.\"</p><p> Under the legislation (S.2490), trains carrying putrescible waste \u2013 or trash which is subject to decay \u2013 would be covered with hard, sealing lids before exiting their transfer stations. Non-putrescible waste would be covered with hard tarping.</p><p> \"While transporting waste by rail may be environmentally and economically preferable to using fleets of trucks, the practice certainly has its drawbacks,\" said Addabbo. \"However, I believe that 'putting a lid on it' will help to reduce the negative impacts of hauling trash by train. We should be able to cut down on pollution without subjecting railway neighbors to unpleasant odors and other unfortunate side effects.\"</p><p> Having passed the Senate, the legislation is now under review by the Assembly.</p><p> ROZIC ALLOCATES FUNDING FOR JOHN BOWNE HS: On Monday, June 17, Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D,WF-Fresh Meadows) announced $35,500 in funding for John Bowne High School in Flushing. The funding has been allocated for John Bowne's hydroponics program, an alternative method of growing plants without soil by using water-based nutrient solutions. The use of hydroponics is part of John Bowne's Agriculture Program which has been nationally recognized for its urban agricultural education offerings, including classes in the plant and animal sciences.</p><p> \u2014With contributions by Annette Hanze Alberts</p><p> \u2014With contributions by Annette Hanze Alberts</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-ece37faa79ea1a68f488402b162ea55291e66</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898BD3406B67E NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDB-N511-DXVP-V434-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Service Advertising Group Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The most obvious example being the new customizable widgets (iOS had widgets before, but it was limited to the left-most screen of the main menu). Another big change is the introduction of the App Library, a decluttered app screen that's suspiciously similar to Android's app drawer. There are other changes, too, such as a discreet view for Siri that won't take over your whole display, and a new picture-in-picture mode. </p><p>And yes, these are features that we've seen on Android as well.But for me, the real star of iOS 14 is not quite so obvious (It's so low-key that Apple didn't mention it at its WWDC keynote). It's the fact that, at long last, iOS now lets you pick your own default email and browser apps. This one feature, more than any other, is what I feel is a key factor in preventing me from switching to Android. That's because, as an iOS user, it is not Android that I find attractive -- it's Google. Even though I've used several Android handsets over the years, I've always stuck with an iPhone. For one thing, I'm so invested in the ecosystem at this point (I've purchased many apps, several of which are iOS-only) that switching to another platform would be too painful.But the main reason that I still have an iPhone, despite the many advantages of Android, is simply force of habit. Its interface, design language and keyboard feel so much like second nature that I can't get used to anything else. This is a huge reason why Android's widgets and home screens simply don't appeal to me: I just never saw the need for them. Even now, after I've installed iOS 14, I haven't bothered adding a widget or cleaning up my home screen, because I just like it the way it is. I suspect many other iOS users feel the same. Chesnot via Getty Images For me, the main benefit that Android has over iOS has never been its design or its interface or anything like that. The main advantages with Android, in my view, are the features. Specifically, its compatibility with Google's apps and services. That's because, as much as I like iOS, Google is the world in which I live. I use Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps, Google Photos and Chrome literally every day. I find Google services easier and more pleasant to use, and I like that it all syncs together. The fact that Android comes with Gmail, Chrome and all the usual Google services by default, working seamlessly with a single sign-on, is great.That hasn't been the case with iOS, and one can certainly understand why. Apple obviously wants you to use its own apps and services over the competition. Sure, third-party apps like Gmail and Chrome have been around for a few years now but there were always certain restrictions. The biggest hassle is that tapping on an email link in an app or in Safari would often kick me over the default Apple Mail app rather than Gmail (If you tapped on an email link in the Chrome app, it does let you go to Gmail however). Now, thanks to iOS 14, this is no longer a problem.Of course, it's likely that Apple isn't allowing this in iOS 14 out of the goodness of its heart. Instead, it could be a tactical move. The company is already facing serious antitrust scrutiny[2] as well as accusations that it holds an App Store monopoly, partially due to the 30 percent commission it charges developers (This is the basis of Epic's recent legal battle with Apple[3]). Perhaps, by ceding ground on default iOS apps, Apple could be heading off concerns that it holds a monopoly over that at the very least. It is not unlike when Microsoft was forced to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows in 2009 due to European regulations.Be that as it may, this could be a sign of greater things to come. It's given me a glimmer of hope that other Google apps, like Calendar and Maps for example, could be given the default treatment too. Of course, there are many things that Android still does better than iOS, such as managing notifications, app permission handling, Live Transcribe, the ability to sideload apps not from an App Store, and more. But if all I get is greater access to Google's apps and services while still keeping the phone I like, I'd be happy.

It's a region with a lot of Republicans and swing voters of the kind both parties will need in 2020.</p><p>But even in the reddest, most conservative corners of this purple place, Klobuchar has cleaned up. In three statewide elections over a dozen years, she has beaten Republican opponents by 20, 35 and 24 points, respectively. Farmers, miners, truckers, nurses and teachers - many of them the white, working-class voters who tipped the scale last time - have turned out to support her.</p><p>\"In a moment when the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/kavanaugh-throws-blackout-question-back-to-klobuchar-then-apologizes/2018/09/27/211387c8-c2b0-11e8-9451-e878f96be19b_video.html?utm_term=.965f14a20b40\">Democratic party is split</url> between moving further to the left and defeating Donald Trump, Klobuchar steps in and says, 'Well, I can do both.

Our laws need to be as sophisticated as the people who are breaking them.\"</p><p>Klobuchar might be able to win the presidency, but that's not worth much if she can't win the nomination first. And to do that, political analysts say, she might need to look homeward again.</p><p>Minnesota</p><p>Klobuchar, who turns 59 this month, grew up in Plymouth, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, the state's largest city and a launching ground for its biggest political stars, including former vice-presidents Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale, a Klobuchar mentor.</p><p>Her mother was a grade-school teacher descended from Swiss immigrants; her father, who is 91, was a popular newspaper columnist; and her grandfather was an iron ore miner whose family immigrated from Slovenia. (The name Klobuchar means \"hatmaker\" in Slovene, the senator informs us in her memoir.)</p><p>Klobuchar has pointed out that her family background gives her an unlikely tie to the White House. \"Melania is Slovenian, just like me!\" she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/kavanaugh-throws-blackout-question-back-to-klobuchar-then-apologizes/2018/09/27/211387c8-c2b0-11e8-9451-e878f96be19b_video.html?utm_term=.965f14a20b40\">joked in a Vogue profile</url>. \"I say every time I look at her, it's like looking in the mirror.\"</p><p>After growing up hearing stories about her grandfather saving for her father's college by filling coffee tins with cash, Klobuchar attended Yale University, earned a law degree at the University of Chicago, and joined a corporate firm in Minneapolis.</p><p>Then life took a turn. Her daughter, Abigail, was born with a condition that prevented her from swallowing. But Klobuchar was not allowed to stay overnight in the hospital where her infant was in intensive care. Infuriated, she became a citizen lobbyist - and succeeded in winning a law allowing mothers to stay in hospitals for at least 48 hours after childbirth.</p><p>Klobuchar ran for county attorney in 1998 and became responsible for overseeing criminal prosecutions in Minneapolis and 35 surrounding suburbs. She pushed to allow videotaping of police interviews of criminal suspects and pioneered hate crimes legislation. After four years, she won re-election unopposed.</p><p>                   Washington                   </p><p>When she ran for US Senate in 2006, the state discovered an indefatigable fundraising juggernaut. As a candidate, Klobuchar called for a \"renewable energy revolution\" and penalties for oil companies, but she also ran as a centrist, preaching fiscal discipline and sitting on the fence on the question of withdrawing troops from Iraq.</p><p>\"I don't think you can say that [invading Iraq] has made us safer,\" she said. \"But I don't believe we can pull out tomorrow. We have to have a plan to bring the troops home safely and it must be done responsibly.\"</p><p>Klobuchar was the first woman elected to the US Senate from Minnesota. She soon showed her industriousness as a consumer protections advocate, and later she shepherded into law measures to combat sexual assault, prevent human trafficking, prevent elder abuse and to fight the opioid epidemic. In 2016 she was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/kavanaugh-throws-blackout-question-back-to-klobuchar-then-apologizes/2018/09/27/211387c8-c2b0-11e8-9451-e878f96be19b_video.html?utm_term=.965f14a20b40\">ranked first</url> in the Senate for getting bills signed into law.

But to Klobuchar, it was just \"kind of sad\".</p><p>                   'Iowa slingshot'                   </p><p>Each candidate for president talks about a path through the primary states, which vote over a series of months in a party-approved order. Nearly every path includes a good showing in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primary season.</p><p>Klobuchar, who has a relatively slight national profile, is in particular need of an Iowa boost. But she might be able to capitalize on a sort of home-court advantage there, in part because the state borders Minnesota and many voters especially in northern Iowa already know of her, said Jacobs.</p><p>\"If she can kind of shock the political world in Iowa, and end up in one of the top one or two or three positions, she's going to get that opportunity to make her case that she offers both electability and progressive values,\" said Jacobs.</p><p>\"She's looking for an Iowa slingshot.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53084600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-YMC1-JCJY-G36N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1635\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

CEO Tim Cook emphasised the strong performance of services instead, where revenues rose 19 per cent.</p><p>This year, Apple switched back to the iPhone success story, reporting \u201cstrong demand\u201d for the iPhone 11, with holiday quarter\u00a0revenues up 8 per cent to $56bn, much better than analysts expected. In contrast, there were no numbers on the November 1 launch of its newest service Apple TV+, apart from Tim Cook citing several awards nominations for<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> The Morning Show.</emphasis>Apple gave no subscriber figures, no revenue details and nothing on the considerable costs it will have incurred on creating\u00a0content and a big marketing campaign.</p><p>It would only have been two months of data\u00a0anyway and many subscribers are getting the service free for a year with any new device, but the lack of a story here suggests a slow start in the streaming wars. Instead, the emphasis for now is on growing the installed base of Apple gear that can be used to\u00a0buy such services, with\u00a0the company announcing\u00a0the number of devices had grown to 1.5bn from 1.4bn a year ago.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-launch-new-low-cost-iPhone-in-2020-to-halt-sales-decline\"> new cut-price phone </url>expected in March and the iPhone 11 are central to this strategy, with the 11 base model also being made more affordable with a $50 cut compared to the previous generation, along with discounts offered for trade-ins and interest-free Apple Pay financing being pushed.

As Sajid Javid was proudly proclaiming that Britain would have the toughest internet laws in the world, it emerged that a British woman had been arrested on a trip to Dubai and faced up to two years in prison for describing her ex-husband's new wife as a 'horse' on Facebook. So does the Home Secretary want the UK to have tougher internet laws than the United Arab Emirates? If so, he might find himself at odds with the Foreign Secretary, who has been working behind the scenes to secure the poor woman's release.</p><p>You can see why Javid, one of the front-runners in the Conservative party's imminent leadership election, thought this would be an easy political win. According to research by Ofcom last year, 79 per cent of UK adult internet users have concerns about going online and the father of Molly Russell, the 14-year-old who committed suicide in 2017 after accessing unsuitable material on Instagram, has been campaigning for laws to purge the internet of harmful content. In addition, the role that 'disinformation' and 'fake news' played in the EU referendum was highlighted in a recent report by the Department for Media, Culture and Sport select committee. Large social media companies such as Facebook, which owns Instagram, have been given ample opportunity to self-regulate and haven't got the job done. Isn't it about time a new sheriff stepped in to tame this Wild West?</p><p>But if you read Online Harms it soon becomes clear that it's very difficult to 'clean up' the internet without encroaching on free speech. Like most people, I don't want social media platforms such as Twitter to be used for sharing child pornography, recruiting Isis terrorists or disseminating fake news manufactured on Russian troll farms. But much of this activity is already illegal under a profusion of recent UK legislation, including the 1986 Public Order Act, the 1988 Malicious Communications Act, the 2000 Terrorism Act, the 2003 Communications Act and the 2006 Terrorism Act.</p><p>The new internet regulator proposed by the white paper - I call it iPlod - would not only be given sweeping powers to make sure tech companies are complying with these laws. It would also be able to levy fines of up to 4 per cent of worldwide turnover and jail company directors - and could use this leverage to prohibit speech that is perfectly lawful and which few would object to. The only way to prevent that is to delineate the scope of the regulator very precisely, and Online Harms fails to do that.</p><p>For instance, the word 'harm' isn't defined, even though it appears in the title. That's alarming because the white paper says the new regulator will ban online material 'that may directly or indirectly cause harm' even if the content in question is 'not necessarily illegal'. As an example of what it has in mind, the government singles out 'offensive material', as if giving offence is itself a type of harm. In effect, then, iPlod will have the power to prohibit speech which isn't unlawful but which it believes may indirectly cause harm because it's offensive. That gives it almost limitless scope to prohibit the expression of opinions which some find disagreeable.</p><p>There's much talk in the document of a 'right of appeal', but this turns out to apply to the tech companies only - individual internet users cannot appeal the regulator's decisions - and would necessitate applying for a judicial review. Not only is that a lengthy and cumbersome procedure, but how could Twitter or Facebook demonstrate that a particular viewpoint won't under any circumstances cause harm, particularly when 'harm' isn't defined?</p><p>Merely showing that it hasn't caused the complainant any tangible harm won't be sufficient, since all the regulator will need to show is that it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">may</emphasis> cause them <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">indirect</emphasis> harm. More or less anything falls into that category, particularly if iPlod can claim that causing offence is a form of harm.</p><p>Other undefined terms in the white paper include 'unacceptable content', 'trolling', 'intimidation' and 'cyberbullying'. Judgments about what forms of lawful speech are 'unacceptable' or constitute 'trolling', 'intimidation' and 'cyberbullying' are almost wholly subjective, yet these are all activities that tech executives will be expected to ban on pain of massive fines or imprisonment. It's a safe bet that they will err on the side of caution - extreme caution, given how high the stakes are.</p><p>Joy Hyvarinen, the Index on Censorship's head of advocacy, says her group is 'very concerned about the proposals to introduce fines and personal liability for senior executives because this will create a very strong incentive to restrict and remove online content'.</p><p>The part of the document concerned with fake news, which the new regulator is also expected to stamp out, is equally woolly. In a section entitled 'Disinformation', the white paper says tech companies will 'need to take proportionate and proactive measures...to minimise the spread of misleading and harmful disinformation and to increase the accessibility of trustworthy and varied news content'. But who's to say what content is 'misleading' and what's 'trustworthy'? The document suggests social media platforms should promote 'authoritative news sources' and make use of 'reputable fact-checking services', but terms like 'authoritative' and 'reputable' just beg the question. The only thing we know for certain is that fake social media accounts will be explicitly banned, so no more satirical Titania McGraths.</p><p>To a great extent, the threat to free speech posed by iPlod will depend upon how its employees exercise their discretion and whether they're politically neutral. Unfortunately, it will be staffed by the same sort of quangocrats that run the Advertising Standards Authority, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and Public Health England, and we know from experience that these busybodies will use whatever powers they have to extend the reach of the nanny state. That nearly always involves enforcing left-wing orthodoxy, whether consciously or not. One ominous sign is that the Muslim lobby group Tell Mama is cited in the white paper as a 'trusted flagger', with the implication that it will help draft the code of conduct that the regulator will enforce. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence. In 2014, Tell Mama unsuccessfully tried to sue Charles Moore for challenging the group's estimates of the rise in Islamophobic hate crimes following the murder of Lee Rigby.</p><p>Some newspapers welcomed the publication of Online Harms, presumably because they think it will make life more difficult for Facebook and Google, who've been leeching away their readers and ad revenue for years. But it won't be long before it dawns on them that the proposed regulator will actually entrench the monopolies of these online leviathans. After all, Google and Facebook are jointly worth about $200 billion so they can afford to comply with any pesky new regulations. It's their less well-resourced competitors who will struggle. Alternatively, the big tech companies can simply reduce their operational footprint in the UK, thereby escaping the new regulator's jurisdiction.</p><p>'It would be very hard to impose fines on companies like Facebook and Google if they base their operations in the United States since they'll be protected under the First Amendment,' says Preston Byrne, a fellow of the Adam Smith Institute and a practicing lawyer in the US. 'In that scenario, it's only their British-based rivals that will have a huge compliance bill. That means if you're an ambitious Oxford graduate who wants to set up a social media company, you won't do it in England.'</p><p>Another reason the British press may sour on this proposal is that the regulations will apply to them, not just Google and Facebook. In the section entitled 'Companies in scope of the regulatory framework' it says: 'The regulatory framework will apply to companies that provide services or tools that allow, enable or facilitate users to share or discover user-generated content, or interact with each other online.' So that's any newspaper or magazine with a comment section. They could get around that by scrapping user-generated content altogether, including letters to the editor. But it's hard to see how that would help them in their battle for eyeballs with the tech giants.</p><p>And who's to say the deputy leader of the Labour party won't propose an amendment to the internet regulation bill, bringing newspapers and magazines firmly in scope? Tom Watson, who led Labour's efforts to introduce state regulation of the press in the wake of the Leveson inquiry, welcomed the white paper but claimed it didn't go far enough. 'This is a start but it's a long way from truly reclaiming the web and routing out online harms,' he said. We all know what comes next. Watson will argue that it would be absurd for Mumsnet to be covered by the regulator, but not the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daily Mail</emphasis>. It was the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mail</emphasis>, after all, that uploaded video footage by the Christchurch shooter, not Mumsnet. If part of the rationale for 'cleaning up' the web is to stop that kind of material ending up online it doesn't make sense for the most visited English-language website in the world to be out of scope. I can hear Watson now: 'Honourable members, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get the gutter press to act more responsibly when it comes to children and other vulnerable groups and to stop them publishing the smears and lies that poison our democracy. We must seize it with both hands.'</p><p>Internet regulation may seem like a good idea - a way to safeguard children and stop the spread of terrorism online. But if it's based on these proposals, it poses an unprecedented threat to free speech and could easily be used to impose a censorious code of conduct on newspapers and magazines. Sajid Javid was a staunch defender of press freedom as culture secretary from 2014-15 and has a lot of friends in the media as a result. But he needs to look again at these proposals or he's in danger of losing that good will. As things stand, he's beginning to look like Tom Watson's useful idiot.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPECTR-10769952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPECTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW7-BF11-F0JS-N35T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Spectator Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Spectator</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48251\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 13, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The videostreaming firm was once touted as one of the most promising startups. Some even called it the brightest tech star of ChiNext. But alas, Leshi turned out to be a scandal-ridden, financially troubled company.</p><p>What added to ChiNext's embarrassment is the fact that the country's most well-known tech giants - Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD, which are abbreviated as BATJ - have all listed their shares on overseas markets.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of users in China use BATJ's services on a daily basis. Yet they have either very limited means or almost no way to buy shares of BATJ. In contrast, the Big Tech Four offer prodigious returns to overseas investors who are not exactly its consumers/users.</p><p>For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose world record-breaking initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $25 billion in September 2014, offered its shares at $68 apiece. The stock started trading at $92.70 straightaway.</p><p>Nearly four years after the IPO, Alibaba's stock price has increased by more than 190 percent.</p><p>What about investors in China where Alibaba earns most of its revenues and profits? \"Many good companies are developing and the domestic (investors) have not been able to enjoy the fruits and profits of their development. This is a historical regret. Entering the new era, this regret should no longer continue,\" said Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body.</p><p>Such regrets have prompted the CSRC to ponder significant regulatory changes. It now aims to not only bolster the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges' status as attractive listing hubs for technology firms but catch the next wave of IPOs by Chinese \"unicorns\" (those with a valuation of $1 billion or more each).</p><p>The securities regulator's move to boost tech representation in the stock markets is in line with the country's transition toward higher-quality economic growth driven by innovation and technological advancement.</p><p>Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed out, China is in a critical period of improving its economic structure and upgrading the growth engines of the economy.</p><p>Beijing hopes the capital market will play a bigger role in nurturing the new economy and serve the financing needs of small but promising companies.</p><p>To realize such hopes, the CSRC has started to fast-track the approval process for tech IPOs. The latest evidence was the superfast approval for the planned $4.3 billion IPO by Foxconn Industrial Internet, the local unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer.</p><p>Foxconn's clients include Apple and Amazon. In a record-breaking 36 days, Foxconn received the CSRC's green signal. Normally, it could take months or even years for companies to obtain the regulatory go-ahead for IPOs.</p><p>In addition to speedy approvals, the regulator is reportedly considering according \"special treatment\" to unicorns. This could mean easing of the profitability requirement for IPOs of unicorns from the four sectors of biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are also drafting detailed rules and arrangements that will allow overseas-listed Chinese tech companies to return to the home markets.</p><p>The idea is to make amends for the \"regret\" and enable mainland investors to trade their shares.</p><p>Encouragingly, executives of tech companies including Baidu Inc and NetEase Inc have expressed interest in listing their shares on domestic stock markets as well.</p><p>Electronics and software company Xiaomi Corp is also said to have planned a float on both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets.</p><p>Wang Jianjun, general manager of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, said the bourse has finished the basic preparation for a pilot program that will allow listings of tech unicorns. He hoped the regulator would allow innovative firms that are not yet profitable to float shares in the domestic capital market.</p><p>Analysts said the anticipated domestic floats of overseas-listed tech companies and tech unicorns will require a major revamp of existing rules. Under the current IPO regime, requirements related to continuous profitability and share structure are considered very stringent.</p><p>For example, one listing requirement of the Shenzhen's startup board is that a company must be profitable in the past two years and have profit of at least 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) or have net asset of at least 20 million yuan in the previous quarter. Another example is that the law requires that a shareholding company must follow the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>\"The existing rules were designed for the old industrial economy with too much emphasis on business scale and profitability. It would be very hard for the new unicorn companies to meet these requirements if the regulator does not make changes to the rules,\" said Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</p><p>Dong said the IPO reform also faces immense legal hurdles as the country's existing laws ban companies registered in overseas markets and those with dual-class share structure from selling shares in the mainland stock markets.</p><p>Dual-class share structure refers to the arrangement that grants a particular group of shareholders greater voting rights than others, different from the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that the securities regulator is considering introduction of Chinese Depositary Receipts, a system that will allow overseas-listed companies to transfer part of their shares to a custodian bank, which can sell them on a mainland exchange board.</p><p>\"We have studied the option of CDRs for a very long time and have made preparations in terms of trading system and rules. At present, the conditions have become relatively mature,\" Wang, the head of the Shenzhen bourse, was quoted by Shanghai Securities News as saying.</p><p>The priority the mainland regulator and stock exchanges are giving to tech companies also underscores the intensified competition among Asian bourses.</p><p>The Hong Kong stock exchange and the Singapore Exchange are expected to offer soon favorable terms for companies with dual-class share structure, in a bid to get ahead in the regional IPO race.</p><p>\"The IPO reform of the mainland market is like an arrow on a bowstring. We can expect major breakthroughs,\" Dong said.</p><p>Equity analysts and market mavens are already wondering about the potential impact of the expected IPO deluge on the A-share market.</p><p>\"Overseas-listed companies will have greater advantage as they are often higher-quality companies. They will get more attention from the investors if they list on the A-share market. And because investors have more options, their local listing could exert pressure on the prices of existing A shares,\" said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn\">lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn</email></p><p>(China Daily 03/19/2018 page13)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/95/152142052412.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/95/152142052412.jpg</url></p><p>f04da2db11221c19441608.jpg<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/8/152142052487.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/8/152142052487.jpg</url></p><p>f04da2db11221c19441a09.jpg<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/50/152142052578.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/50/152142052578.jpg</url></p><p>f04da2db11221c1944210a.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-112370116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX1-34X1-JDJN-64XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

Some even called it the brightest tech star of ChiNext. But alas, Leshi turned out to be a scandal-ridden, financially troubled company.</p><p>What added to ChiNext's embarrassment is the fact that the country's most well-known tech giants\uff0dBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD, which are abbreviated as BATJ\uff0dhave all listed their shares on overseas markets.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of users in China use BATJ's services on a daily basis. Yet they have either very limited means or almost no way to buy shares of BATJ. In contrast, the Big Tech Four offer prodigious returns to overseas investors who are not exactly its consumers/users.</p><p>For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose world record-breaking initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $25 billion in September 2014, offered its shares at $68 apiece. The stock started trading at $92.70 straightaway.</p><p>Nearly four years after the IPO, Alibaba's stock price has increased by more than 190 percent.</p><p>What about investors in China where Alibaba earns most of its revenues and profits? \"Many good companies are developing and the domestic (investors) have not been able to enjoy the fruits and profits of their development. This is a historical regret. Entering the new era, this regret should no longer continue,\" said Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body.</p><p>Such regrets have prompted the CSRC to ponder significant regulatory changes. It now aims to not only bolster the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges' status as attractive listing hubs for technology firms but catch the next wave of IPOs by Chinese \"unicorns\" (those with a valuation of $1 billion or more each).</p><p>The securities regulator's move to boost tech representation in the stock markets is in line with the country's transition toward higher-quality economic growth driven by innovation and technological advancement.</p><p>Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed out, China is in a critical period of improving its economic structure and upgrading the growth engines of the economy.</p><p>Beijing hopes the capital market will play a bigger role in nurturing the new economy and serve the financing needs of small but promising companies.</p><p>To realize such hopes, the CSRC has started to fast-track the approval process for tech IPOs. The latest evidence was the superfast approval for the planned $4.3 billion IPO by Foxconn Industrial Internet, the local unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer.</p><p>Foxconn's clients include Apple and Amazon. In a record-breaking 36 days, Foxconn received the CSRC's green signal. Normally, it could take months or even years for companies to obtain the regulatory go-ahead for IPOs.</p><p>In addition to speedy approvals, the regulator is reportedly considering according \"special treatment\" to unicorns. This could mean easing of the profitability requirement for IPOs of unicorns from the four sectors of biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are also drafting detailed rules and arrangements that will allow overseas-listed Chinese tech companies to return to the home markets.</p><p>The idea is to make amends for the \"regret\" and enable mainland investors to trade their shares.</p><p>Encouragingly, executives of tech companies including Baidu Inc and NetEase Inc have expressed interest in listing their shares on domestic stock markets as well.</p><p>Electronics and software company Xiaomi Corp is also said to have planned a float on both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets.</p><p>Wang Jianjun, general manager of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, said the bourse has finished the basic preparation for a pilot program that will allow listings of tech unicorns. He hoped the regulator would allow innovative firms that are not yet profitable to float shares in the domestic capital market.</p><p>Analysts said the anticipated domestic floats of overseas-listed tech companies and tech unicorns will require a major revamp of existing rules. Under the current IPO regime, requirements related to continuous profitability and share structure are considered very stringent.</p><p>For example, one listing requirement of the Shenzhen's startup board is that a company must be profitable in the past two years and have profit of at least 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) or have net asset of at least 20 million yuan in the previous quarter. Another example is that the law requires that a shareholding company must follow the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>\"The existing rules were designed for the old industrial economy with too much emphasis on business scale and profitability. It would be very hard for the new unicorn companies to meet these requirements if the regulator does not make changes to the rules,\" said Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</p><p>Dong said the IPO reform also faces immense legal hurdles as the country's existing laws ban companies registered in overseas markets and those with dual-class share structure from selling shares in the mainland stock markets.</p><p>Dual-class share structure refers to the arrangement that grants a particular group of shareholders greater voting rights than others, different from the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that the securities regulator is considering introduction of Chinese Depositary Receipts, a system that will allow overseas-listed companies to transfer part of their shares to a custodian bank, which can sell them on a mainland exchange board.</p><p>\"We have studied the option of CDRs for a very long time and have made preparations in terms of trading system and rules. At present, the conditions have become relatively mature,\" Wang, the head of the Shenzhen bourse, was quoted by Shanghai Securities News as saying.</p><p>The priority the mainland regulator and stock exchanges are giving to tech companies also underscores the intensified competition among Asian bourses.</p><p>The Hong Kong stock exchange and the Singapore Exchange are expected to offer soon favorable terms for companies with dual-class share structure, in a bid to get ahead in the regional IPO race.</p><p>\"The IPO reform of the mainland market is like an arrow on a bowstring. We can expect major breakthroughs,\" Dong said.</p><p>Equity analysts and market mavens are already wondering about the potential impact of the expected IPO deluge on the A-share market.</p><p>\"Overseas-listed companies will have greater advantage as they are often higher-quality companies. They will get more attention from the investors if they list on the A-share market. And because investors have more options, their local listing could exert pressure on the prices of existing A shares,\" said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1497/39/152142547164.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1497/39/152142547164.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDAW-112371510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDAW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX1-34X1-JDJN-654S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

Some even called it the brightest tech star of ChiNext. But alas, Leshi turned out to be a scandal-ridden, financially troubled company.</p><p>What added to ChiNext's embarrassment is the fact that the country's most well-known tech giants\uff0dBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD, which are abbreviated as BATJ\uff0dhave all listed their shares on overseas markets.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of users in China use BATJ's services on a daily basis. Yet they have either very limited means or almost no way to buy shares of BATJ. In contrast, the Big Tech Four offer prodigious returns to overseas investors who are not exactly its consumers/users.</p><p>For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose world record-breaking initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $25 billion in September 2014, offered its shares at $68 apiece. The stock started trading at $92.70 straightaway.</p><p>Nearly four years after the IPO, Alibaba's stock price has increased by more than 190 percent.</p><p>What about investors in China where Alibaba earns most of its revenues and profits? \"Many good companies are developing and the domestic (investors) have not been able to enjoy the fruits and profits of their development. This is a historical regret. Entering the new era, this regret should no longer continue,\" said Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body.</p><p>Such regrets have prompted the CSRC to ponder significant regulatory changes. It now aims to not only bolster the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges' status as attractive listing hubs for technology firms but catch the next wave of IPOs by Chinese \"unicorns\" (those with a valuation of $1 billion or more each).</p><p>The securities regulator's move to boost tech representation in the stock markets is in line with the country's transition toward higher-quality economic growth driven by innovation and technological advancement.</p><p>Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed out, China is in a critical period of improving its economic structure and upgrading the growth engines of the economy.</p><p>Beijing hopes the capital market will play a bigger role in nurturing the new economy and serve the financing needs of small but promising companies.</p><p>To realize such hopes, the CSRC has started to fast-track the approval process for tech IPOs. The latest evidence was the superfast approval for the planned $4.3 billion IPO by Foxconn Industrial Internet, the local unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer.<br/>Foxconn's clients include Apple and Amazon. In a record-breaking 36 days, Foxconn received the CSRC's green signal. Normally, it could take months or even years for companies to obtain the regulatory go-ahead for IPOs.</p><p>In addition to speedy approvals, the regulator is reportedly considering according \"special treatment\" to unicorns. This could mean easing of the profitability requirement for IPOs of unicorns from the four sectors of biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are also drafting detailed rules and arrangements that will allow overseas-listed Chinese tech companies to return to the home markets.</p><p>The idea is to make amends for the \"regret\" and enable mainland investors to trade their shares.</p><p>Encouragingly, executives of tech companies including Baidu Inc and NetEase Inc have expressed interest in listing their shares on domestic stock markets as well.</p><p>Electronics and software company Xiaomi Corp is also said to have planned a float on both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets.</p><p>Wang Jianjun, general manager of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, said the bourse has finished the basic preparation for a pilot program that will allow listings of tech unicorns. He hoped the regulator would allow innovative firms that are not yet profitable to float shares in the domestic capital market.</p><p>Analysts said the anticipated domestic floats of overseas-listed tech companies and tech unicorns will require a major revamp of existing rules. Under the current IPO regime, requirements related to continuous profitability and share structure are considered very stringent.<br/>For example, one listing requirement of the Shenzhen's startup board is that a company must be profitable in the past two years and have profit of at least 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) or have net asset of at least 20 million yuan in the previous quarter. Another example is that the law requires that a shareholding company must follow the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>\"The existing rules were designed for the old industrial economy with too much emphasis on business scale and profitability. It would be very hard for the new unicorn companies to meet these requirements if the regulator does not make changes to the rules,\" said Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</p><p>Dong said the IPO reform also faces immense legal hurdles as the country's existing laws ban companies registered in overseas markets and those with dual-class share structure from selling shares in the mainland stock markets.</p><p>Dual-class share structure refers to the arrangement that grants a particular group of shareholders greater voting rights than others, different from the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that the securities regulator is considering introduction of Chinese Depositary Receipts, a system that will allow overseas-listed companies to transfer part of their shares to a custodian bank, which can sell them on a mainland exchange board.</p><p>\"We have studied the option of CDRs for a very long time and have made preparations in terms of trading system and rules. At present, the conditions have become relatively mature,\" Wang, the head of the Shenzhen bourse, was quoted by Shanghai Securities News as saying.</p><p>The priority the mainland regulator and stock exchanges are giving to tech companies also underscores the intensified competition among Asian bourses.</p><p>The Hong Kong stock exchange and the Singapore Exchange are expected to offer soon favorable terms for companies with dual-class share structure, in a bid to get ahead in the regional IPO race.</p><p>\"The IPO reform of the mainland market is like an arrow on a bowstring. We can expect major breakthroughs,\" Dong said.<br/>Equity analysts and market mavens are already wondering about the potential impact of the expected IPO deluge on the A-share market.</p><p>\"Overseas-listed companies will have greater advantage as they are often higher-quality companies. They will get more attention from the investors if they list on the A-share market. And because investors have more options, their local listing could exert pressure on the prices of existing A shares,\" said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/76/152146136653.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/76/152146136653.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDHK-112389718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDHK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX3-2P91-F11P-X1J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

Some even called it the brightest tech star of ChiNext. But alas, Leshi turned out to be a scandal-ridden, financially troubled company.</p><p>What added to ChiNext's embarrassment is the fact that the country's most well-known tech giants\uff0dBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD, which are abbreviated as BATJ\uff0dhave all listed their shares on overseas markets.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of users in China use BATJ's services on a daily basis. Yet they have either very limited means or almost no way to buy shares of BATJ. In contrast, the Big Tech Four offer prodigious returns to overseas investors who are not exactly its consumers/users.</p><p>For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose world record-breaking initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $25 billion in September 2014, offered its shares at $68 apiece. The stock started trading at $92.70 straightaway.</p><p>Nearly four years after the IPO, Alibaba's stock price has increased by more than 190 percent.</p><p>What about investors in China where Alibaba earns most of its revenues and profits? \"Many good companies are developing and the domestic (investors) have not been able to enjoy the fruits and profits of their development. This is a historical regret. Entering the new era, this regret should no longer continue,\" said Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body.</p><p>Such regrets have prompted the CSRC to ponder significant regulatory changes. It now aims to not only bolster the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges' status as attractive listing hubs for technology firms but catch the next wave of IPOs by Chinese \"unicorns\" (those with a valuation of $1 billion or more each).</p><p>The securities regulator's move to boost tech representation in the stock markets is in line with the country's transition toward higher-quality economic growth driven by innovation and technological advancement.</p><p>Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed out, China is in a critical period of improving its economic structure and upgrading the growth engines of the economy.</p><p>Beijing hopes the capital market will play a bigger role in nurturing the new economy and serve the financing needs of small but promising companies.</p><p>To realize such hopes, the CSRC has started to fast-track the approval process for tech IPOs. The latest evidence was the superfast approval for the planned $4.3 billion IPO by Foxconn Industrial Internet, the local unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer.</p><p>Foxconn's clients include Apple and Amazon. In a record-breaking 36 days, Foxconn received the CSRC's green signal. Normally, it could take months or even years for companies to obtain the regulatory go-ahead for IPOs.</p><p>In addition to speedy approvals, the regulator is reportedly considering according \"special treatment\" to unicorns. This could mean easing of the profitability requirement for IPOs of unicorns from the four sectors of biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are also drafting detailed rules and arrangements that will allow overseas-listed Chinese tech companies to return to the home markets.</p><p>The idea is to make amends for the \"regret\" and enable mainland investors to trade their shares.</p><p>Encouragingly, executives of tech companies including Baidu Inc and NetEase Inc have expressed interest in listing their shares on domestic stock markets as well.</p><p>Electronics and software company Xiaomi Corp is also said to have planned a float on both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets.</p><p>Wang Jianjun, general manager of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, said the bourse has finished the basic preparation for a pilot program that will allow listings of tech unicorns. He hoped the regulator would allow innovative firms that are not yet profitable to float shares in the domestic capital market.</p><p>Analysts said the anticipated domestic floats of overseas-listed tech companies and tech unicorns will require a major revamp of existing rules. Under the current IPO regime, requirements related to continuous profitability and share structure are considered very stringent.</p><p>For example, one listing requirement of the Shenzhen's startup board is that a company must be profitable in the past two years and have profit of at least 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) or have net asset of at least 20 million yuan in the previous quarter. Another example is that the law requires that a shareholding company must follow the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>\"The existing rules were designed for the old industrial economy with too much emphasis on business scale and profitability. It would be very hard for the new unicorn companies to meet these requirements if the regulator does not make changes to the rules,\" said Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</p><p>Dong said the IPO reform also faces immense legal hurdles as the country's existing laws ban companies registered in overseas markets and those with dual-class share structure from selling shares in the mainland stock markets.</p><p>Dual-class share structure refers to the arrangement that grants a particular group of shareholders greater voting rights than others, different from the \"one share, one vote\" principle.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that the securities regulator is considering introduction of Chinese Depositary Receipts, a system that will allow overseas-listed companies to transfer part of their shares to a custodian bank, which can sell them on a mainland exchange board.</p><p>\"We have studied the option of CDRs for a very long time and have made preparations in terms of trading system and rules. At present, the conditions have become relatively mature,\" Wang, the head of the Shenzhen bourse, was quoted by Shanghai Securities News as saying.</p><p>The priority the mainland regulator and stock exchanges are giving to tech companies also underscores the intensified competition among Asian bourses.</p><p>The Hong Kong stock exchange and the Singapore Exchange are expected to offer soon favorable terms for companies with dual-class share structure, in a bid to get ahead in the regional IPO race.</p><p>\"The IPO reform of the mainland market is like an arrow on a bowstring. We can expect major breakthroughs,\" Dong said.</p><p>Equity analysts and market mavens are already wondering about the potential impact of the expected IPO deluge on the A-share market.</p><p>\"Overseas-listed companies will have greater advantage as they are often higher-quality companies. They will get more attention from the investors if they list on the A-share market. And because investors have more options, their local listing could exert pressure on the prices of existing A shares,\" said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1496/65/152142506358.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1496/65/152142506358.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDUS-112370912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX1-34X1-JDJN-650P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411374</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

But the IPO market is the hottest it's been in years -- and 2020 could be its biggest year ever.    With three months left on the calendar, U.S.-listed initial public offerings have raised nearly $95 billion through Wednesday, according to data provider Dealogic. That already surpasses the totals of every year except 2014 since the tech bubble in 2000. It's nipping at the heels of 2014, when IPOs raised $96 billion, more than a quarter of it by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.    Bankers, lawyers and executives say that if the frenetic pace keeps up, 2020 will eclipse the tech-boom years of 1999 and 2000, when investors feverishly pumped money into burgeoning internet stocks before they crashed to Earth.    Investors are gobbling up these new listings, with this year's IPOs posting the biggest gains during their trading debuts since 2000, at 22% through Wednesday. On average, 2020 IPOs have risen roughly 24% from their original prices.    The fortunes of the IPO market have never been more divergent with the state of the U.S. economy. The coronavirus pandemic sent businesses into free fall, pushing unemployment to its highest level ever this spring. But it also caused a shift in the economy. With everyone relying more on technology for work, school and everyday communications, the value of companies providing related services pushed higher. And with low interest rates limiting returns on traditionally safe investments like bonds, investors are looking for ways to make money wherever they can.    This year, more than 80% of the money raised by initial public offerings falls into three buckets: healthcare, technology and newly popular blank-check companies -- shell firms whose only purpose is to acquire a private target and take it public. That is the most concentrated the IPO market has been since 2007, according to Dealogic, when new listings of banks and lending institutions flooded the market before the financial crisis.    More than 235 companies have joined the U.S. public markets this year, on track for the most since 439 companies went public in 2000, according to Dealogic. They'll soon be joined by giants Airbnb Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc., which will go public later this year after long tours as private companies.    Even Warren Buffett, America's most well-known value investor, who typically avoids investing in startups, is participating.    Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought roughly $735 million in shares of data-warehousing company Snowflake Inc.'s public offering. Shares finished their first day of trading on Sept. 16 at more than $250 apiece, more than double their IPO price -- making it the biggest tech IPO of the year. At the end of that first day, the company had a market value of $70.4 billion. Mr. Buffett's stake was worth nearly $1.6 billion.    The state of the IPO market is a huge reversal from just a few years ago, when many venture capitalists and CEOs had declared the initial public offering all but dead. For more than a decade, companies opted to raise giant amounts in the private markets, made possible thanks to large funds such as SoftBank Group Corp.'s $100 billion Vision Fund. Staying private allowed startups to avoid the hassle of regulatory disclosures and prevented them from having to answer to public shareholders. In 2016, IPOs and their investors raised less than $25 billion.    Now companies are growing wary of staying private too long after watching some marquee IPOs, like Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., struggle last year. Public investors are also rewarding high-growth companies with big valuations they are unlikely to fetch in the private markets -- a change from a few years ago. Companies are now trying to hit a sweet spot, going public after they've had a chance to mature a bit but before their strong growth trajectory has slowed.    The market is less ecstatic than the feverish tech bubble that infused massive amounts of capital into internet companies like Pets.com, which then burned through cash and collapsed just months later, devastating the stock market. Still, companies that had previously written off a 2020 IPO are forging ahead this year, hoping to ride the wave. Others are planning public debuts in the first half of 2021.    New alternatives    The process of going public is changing as well, after remaining mostly the same since the 1980s.    \"It used to be a formulaic conversation about the path to going public,\" said Bennett Schachter, who heads global alternative capital solutions at Morgan Stanley. Those stages tended to be a series of fundraising rounds, perhaps a private placement to pre-selected investors, a so-called crossover financing round that involves investors that mostly work with public companies, followed by an IPO. \"Now there is this broader and increasingly well-accepted spectrum of alternatives.\"    Blank-check companies have exploded this year as an alternative to the traditional IPO, accounting for more than 40% of the money raised in IPOs this year. That compares to an average of 9% over the previous 10 years, according to Dealogic.    Kevin Hartz, co-founder of Eventbrite Inc., was an early investor in Airbnb, Uber and Pinterest Inc. This year he decided to launch a blank-check company.    His first official meeting with bankers about his venture was in mid-June, he said. Less than two weeks later, he said, he filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the end of July his filing was public. Roughly 60 days after that June meeting with bankers, Mr. Hartz's blank-check company had raised $200 million and almost immediately started reaching out to founders of companies with whom he may want to merge. He said he was amazed how quickly he was able to turn his idea for a blank-check company -- also known as a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC -- into reality.    \"SPACs have the possibility to be the leader in the future,\" he said, noting one of their biggest benefits for founders is that in a reverse merger, a startup can provide shareholders with earnings and growth projections for the future. In a traditional IPO that isn't allowed.    Another alternative more companies are exploring is going public through direct listings -- in which they list employees' and investors' existing shares on the open market, allowing them to potentially cash out their stakes. That lets companies avoid investment banks' big fees for underwriting an IPO, but doesn't allow them to raise additional money.    Palantir, the big-data company co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, will complete a direct listing later this month in one of the biggest market debuts of the year, at an expected value of $22 billion. Software company Asana Inc. is also planning to go public via a direct listing later this month.    Previously, just two major companies had ever gone public that way. Spotify Technology SA, which went public in 2018, spent much of its first two years public trading below its first-day closing price, though its shares have soared since this spring. Slack Technologies Inc., which went public in 2019, remains below its first-day closing level.    The other blockbuster name set to go public this year, house-sharing giant Airbnb, had also planned a direct listing for its 2020 IPO. It had to change plans when the pandemic forced executives to raise additional money, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Airbnb declined to comment.    The rules could soon change. In late August, regulators approved a proposal from the New York Stock Exchange to let companies raise capital through direct listings, though the approval recently hit a snag due to objections from a large investor group. The option would remove a key barrier for companies, making direct listings even more attractive, according to people familiar with the matter. Nasdaq Inc. has filed a similar proposal.    \"There's been more innovation in the last two years than in the last two decades,\" said Stacey Cunningham, the president of the New York Stock Exchange. \"There is a renaissance in the IPO market.\"    Social-distancing measures to avoid the virus have also shaken up the process. The typical IPO roadshow spanned a grueling eight to 10 days when executives traveled the globe and peddled their wares to prospective investors in conference rooms. Now, roadshows are typically shorter and entirely virtual, enabling more investors to participate than ever before.    When online insurance broker SelectQuote Inc. listed its shares on the NYSE in May, it used a four-day virtual roadshow. \"Who would've thought you could raise $350 million in your pajamas from the comfort of your home?\" the company's CEO, Tim Danker, said.    Market shifts    Pandemic-induced shifts in the public and private markets helped usher in the IPOs. As the country shut down earlier this year, the availability of private funding became more scarce. Some executives struggled to raise money at the valuations they wanted. In the second quarter, there was a sharp rise in the number of startups in the private market completing so-called down rounds, or funding rounds where the valuation based on the share price dropped compared with the prior round.    The public funding markets, including the IPO market, also seized up briefly in early March, but swift moves by central banks around the world restarted the flow of money. After the S&amp;P 500 hit its 2020 low in late March, a bond-buying intervention from the Federal Reserve helped companies raise cash -- and enthusiastic bets from individual investors helped drive up shares of big tech companies and propel major indexes higher. Bankers and corporate executives took advantage of the optimism, rushing out companies that had been aiming for early spring IPOs.    To ensure these IPOs went smoothly, companies and their bankers lined up institutional investors, including T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Fidelity Investments, to commit to buying large portions of the company either ahead of the IPO or as part of the public offering. Fund managers told The Wall Street Journal that after a choppy spring that hammered some of their portfolios, they were happy to be able to buy into IPOs, which tend to outperform the broader stock market.    Shares of companies that went public in late May and early June soared, leading a bevy of new issuances this summer. The New York Stock Exchange said August, typically a sleepy time for IPOs, was its busiest month since October 2013.    This spring also brought a surge in financing for blank-check companies -- a sign that there's more demand for IPOs this year than there are companies able to quickly go public.    While the niche has been around for many years, it often wasn't taken seriously. Their legitimacy was bolstered over the past year after high-profile companies like Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and DraftKings Inc. went public through reverse mergers with blank-check firms.    Their structure tends to offer a big payday to the blank-check company's sponsors even if shares fall. Typically, those sponsors are awarded shares equivalent to about 20% to 25% of what is raised in the IPO at the time the target is bought. Some newer blank-check offerings are reducing their cut of the deal. Blank-check IPOs also haven't always performed well; historically, many traded below their offer prices, and deals they strike aren't always approved by shareholders. The newest generation of blank-check sponsors say they want to change that.    The case of electric-truck startup Nikola Corp. shows how risks remain. One of this year's high-profile IPOs through a blank-check company, it is now embroiled in legal and stock-trading woes, with the Justice Department examining allegations that it made exaggerated claims about its technology. A spokeswoman for Nikola declined to comment. Shares have tumbled, but remain above the level they traded when their merger deal was announced.    Meanwhile, struggling streaming-video service Quibi is considering a reverse-merger with a blank-check company to go public, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.    Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 is no stranger to capitalizing on an IPO boom. In 1999, the tech entrepreneur brought his company, Tibco Software Inc., public and watched shares double during their first day of trading. Since then, the software entrepreneur sold Tibco to a private-equity firm in 2014, stayed involved in the world of tech investing and became majority owner of the Sacramento Kings.    In February, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 attended the NBA All-Star Game and ran into some investors who told him he should try his hand at a blank-check company. At first, he was skeptical.    \"A SPAC was a sleazy thing 20 years ago,\" he said. Then the pandemic hit with full force, and the timing seemed perfect to launch a SPAC of his own. So he did.    This summer, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 raised more than $480 million for his new blank-check company. Now he is on the hunt for a target to buy.    --Graphics by Ana Rivas    Write to Corrie Driebusch at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:corrie.driebusch@wsj.com\">corrie.driebusch@wsj.com</email>

Onlookers stared at a temporary stage decked out with a banner that read \"Celebrating 20 Years of Salesforce!\" Onstage, flanked by backup dancers, stood a man dressed in a full black suit singing a familiar tune: \"They can't, they won't, they never will . . . stop the party.\" \"Is this Pitbull'\" I asked a man in a corporate-branded Patagonia vest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He just nodded as he stared ahead. \"Y'all having a good time out there'\" Pitbull asked to silence.</p><p>A good time shouldn't be hard to come by in San Francisco, but don't blame us for being antsy. As if US$24 lunch salads, multiplying tent cities and two-hour commutes across the Bay Bridge weren't worrisome enough, the city at the heart of the global tech revolution is now at the breaking point - and bracing for another wave of wealth to hit. With Bay Area-based tech companies scheduled to hold initial public offerings (IPOs) this year, the city of instant millionaires is about to have thousands of even newer millionaires. And many residents of this city - secretly and not-so-secretly - fear that 2019 is the year San Francisco becomes a truly impossible place to live.</p><p>IPOs should be causes for celebration, and not just for those ringing the bell at the stock exchange. These public and soon-to-be-public companies - the likes of which include Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest, Uber, and Levi Strauss, a San Francisco stalwart founded during a different Gold Rush - will allow everyday investors across the country (finally!) to partake in the fruits of a decade of consumer Internet innovation. Similarly, universities, pension funds and non-profits will see windfalls that will underwrite important work across the country.</p><p>But most of the initial employees and early investors in these unicorns live here in San Francisco, one of the most densely populated metropolitan areas in the United States. In the months after these companies go public, it will be fair to ask: How much wealth can one city take'</p><p>You could say this crisis isn't San Francisco's fault, at least not entirely. It didn't anticipate the smartphone, the app store or the consumer Internet revolution that made San Francisco a magnet for young people seeking burritos and taxis at 3am. It wasn't prepared for global interest rates to hit record lows and remain there, making late-stage venture capital a lucrative asset class where companies could stay private longer, raising funds not from public markets but from individual and institutional investors. It didn't anticipate the worst recession since the Great Depression and the surge of excess labour to power the gig economy. Nor did it notice the emergence of cloud computing that made startups easier to launch from a studio apartment rather than a suburban garage. But it did adopt - and then cling to - closed-minded housing policies for decades, stunting construction and stifling growth even as repeated waves of young people poured into the Bay Area over the past 20 years to build the next big thing. San Francisco, very literally, wasn't built (or zoned) for this many people or this much good fortune.</p><p>A family of four making nearly US$120,000 in San Francisco is now considered low-income by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to a recent report from rental website Zumper, the median market monthly rent for a one-bedroom here has hit an all-time high of US$3,690 - nearly US$45,000 a year. There are social-impact startups, such as Landed, helping the underpaid and underappreciated - like teachers and nurses - afford housing in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you are looking to buy a single-family home, good luck. Although there are about 100,000 vacant homes in San Francisco and neighbouring communities, many aren't for sale. Some have been bought, likely as an investment, and simply left empty. (It isn't uncommon to find apartment buildings here that are one-fourth to one-half empty, an experience that is a little eerie, not to mention inefficient.) Those with the means to buy a home in these parts will find it challenging to lock one down, and the most-discussed topic among young people is: Will I ever be able to afford the apartment I am renting? The irony of this extreme concentration of wealth is that tech was supposed to solve this problem and allow people to innovate anywhere. Instead, this super concentration of new wealth is likely to push talented people and their employers out of the area in search of more sustainable lifestyles - meaning the wealth is pushing people out of San Francisco, not the democratisation of tech. It will also ensure that bashing tech companies is going to be the safest political sport for politicians in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Candidates on both the left and right will lift a page from the early 20th century election playbook, when Standard Oil was depicted as an octopus, dexterous enough to parry Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>No one's weeping for big tech, but the war on Silicon Valley won't solve the region's housing crisis, either. And regulation won't stop a financial culture that will continue to mint more unicorns and, thus, more Bay Area millionaires. We can only hope that a crisis of wealth will lead to better housing policy in the United States' tech capital, and that some of tech's victors will make an exit from this lavish party and take their wealth, their angel investments, their networks and their knowledge to communities outside a fatigued city that simply wasn't prepared for this Big One to hit.

L'operazione, secondo le stime, raccoglier\u00e0 10 miliardi di dollari (8,2 mld euro) nella seconda met\u00e0 dell'anno. L'obiettivo di valutazione dell'azienda \u00e8 compreso fra 80 e 100 mld di dollari (65,5-81,8 mld euro).Intanto le autorit\u00e0 cinesi hanno chiesto che la multinazionale tech sbarchi alla borsa di Pechino: \u00e8 questa la soluzione, secondo il Wall Street Journal, verso cui spingerebbe la China Securities Regulatory Commission (Consob cinese), mentre il produttore di smartphone sta considerando, appunto, la doppia quotazione. Il governo del paese asiatico sta cercando in tutti i modi di mantenere il controllo delle grandi aziende, soprattutto dopo che un numero crescente di big tech ha deciso di quotarsi all'estero. Alibaba, Tencent e Baidu, per esempio, hanno scelto listini esteri. La scorsa settimana Xiaomi ha chiuso un accordo con Microsoft per esplorare la cooperazione nei settori cloud computing, intelligenza artificiale e hardware.\u00a9 Riproduzione riservata</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OGGI-2348556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OGGI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RSC-D6B1-DYDY-92JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ItaliaOggi Editori S.p.A.

I'm H. Andrew Schwartz and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS trade guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jack Caporal: In this episode, I fill in for Andrew as Scott and Bill preview all things surrounding the G20 meetings in Osaka, Japan next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pres. Trump: I'd like to make a deal, but we'll see what happens. But I can tell you as much as I'd like to, China wishes they had that deal to do over again.</p><p>Jack Caporal: President Trump is slated to meet with Xi Jinping on the sidelines. What will come out of those talks? Plus, some optimism on the USMCA timeline and a preview of the first Democratic debates. I'm Jack Caporal. You'll hear all about that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys.</p><p>Jack Caporal: So there's a lot of ground to cover on this week's episode. The main event coming up at the end of the week, June 28th and 29th, is the G20 Leaders' Summit in Osaka, Japan. There, President Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping are going to sit down and try and restart trade talks or call a trade truce or, or what, what are the expectations that we have for this meeting?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Well first, in a way, technically it's a sideshow because there is a G20. There are 18 other countries, they are having a meeting. The Japanese hosts have put digital trade on the agenda. They put WTO reform on the agenda, which is interesting because there, I think our president will be under some pressure. CSIS had a press briefing last Friday with Matt Goodman, Mike Green, and Heather Conley about expectations at the G20, so for all of you out there listening, go to the website and see if you can find it, if you care about the larger issues. For us, the sideshow is what's important, and that is the Trump-Xi meeting, primarily. There's obviously going to be a Trump-Abe meeting.</p><p>Scott Miller: Sure, no doubt, and he's visiting South Korea on his way, so it's a fairly involved week of travel for the president. But to my mind, the fact that there will be a Trump-Xi meeting means that there'll be some sort of progress announced, whether it's just we started the talks or perhaps an agreement that things ... there was a favorable enough discussion that the president's decided to not put tariffs on the List 4 group of products, the next list that we talked about last week with Steve Lamar and others, I had mentioned the List 4. I think something will happen of that nature because the leaders are getting together and they'll want to look, in some ways, like they're making progress.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Sure. So, there's kind of a broader context to this, right? If you look back to the last time Trump and Xi met in Buenos Aires at the last G20, they essentially called the trade truce and then months later the U.S. ratcheted up tariffs after negotiations broke down. I mean, why should we expect this time to be any different? It's like history is repeating itself.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Well, it is. I predict a rerun. I have clients who always want a percentage. You know, they always want the odds, and so I'm forced to do that even though I think it's silly, but I would say 70% chance, sort of temporary happy ending. They either repeat Buenos Aires. Handshakes, smiles, we're going back to the table, tariffs are postponed, the new ones ...</p><p>Scott Miller: Right.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Alternatively, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that they could announce some cosmic agreement in principle, fine print to be filled in later, which will be functionally the same thing because they won't agree on any of the details, but they'll agree that they agreed. Then they'll dump it on Lighthizer and Liu He to do what they would have done otherwise. That puts a more positive spin on it, but it's the same thing. 30% chance, it's like Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. President walks out, tariffs next week or the week after, and it doesn't start all over again. But if it's a 70% chance, I think you're exactly right. We have a rerun at some point, and we've talked about this before here. The president is going to have to confront the fact that he can't get an agreement that gives him everything he wants. So we have to decide if he wants a weaker agreement and suffer that criticism or if he wants to continue the war and escalate the war and suffer that criticism.</p><p>Scott Miller: Sure. Summits are all about show business, and there's no doubt this bilateral between the two leaders will be ... has to be considered in that manner, and so I think the president, our president, and President Xi both would like an outcome that satisfies their interests in stability. So I think that's why ... I agree with Bill's 70-30, maybe a little higher. The odds of something that looks like an agreement and quacks like an agreement is probably the likely outcome.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Sure. Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: The one problem, I think, is that ... or the one danger I see, is that it seems to me that both presidents seem to believe right now that the other is in the weaker position, that Trump clearly feels that the Chinese are being hurt more than we are and that if he just pushes harder, they'll fold. He always says this, and then he doesn't always act on it, but Xi I think feels that, you know, President Trump has an election. He doesn't. There are political forces here that he doesn't have to deal with there. This is not usually a good sign for getting into an agreement if each guy thinks he's stronger than the other one.</p><p>Scott Miller: Right. But a confrontation now has downside risks for President Trump in, you know, consumers actually finally figuring out that they pay the tariffs, and some pressure on markets or increased volatility. Likewise, President Xi, I think it's in his interest to keep this stringing out at its current level just in case he gets a better counterparty in 2021. So, I think both of them have an incentive for stability here instead of confrontation.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yeah. The other piece of this puzzle is in the background, there's this growing tech Cold War between the U.S. and China, right? It seems like every week now is putting more export controls on U.S. companies, high tech companies preventing the export of, you know, computer chips for example, to certain Chinese companies. It kind of raises two questions, right? What would the overall value of trade agreement be if, if there's just this section of trade that's essentially sealed off between the two countries? Then second, can the two sides separate the two issues? I mean, what is a trade negotiation without negotiating over high value products?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Well, I have to say in a moment of non-humility, I predicted this. I predicted this a year ago, year and a half ago. It was only a matter of time before the president discovered export controls and technology transfer controls as a way of squeezing the Chinese, and they're now doing that and searching for every possible alternative. The thing that makes it a little bit difficult is they got a lot of help from the Chinese. There really are security issues. There are sanctions violations issues. The rumor today about some Chinese banks being sanctioned for breaking the ... violating North Korea sanctions; ZTE and Huawei got in trouble because of Iran sanctions. You know, we're not talking about innocent parties here. The fact that there is a significant security overlay, the fact that it all relates to 5G, I think has done a couple things. One, it's consolidated public opinion here. I think people here are much less sympathetic to the Chinese than they used to be. They may or may not see a trade threat, but I think a lot of them see a security threat, and so they're sympathetic to this. They do blur together. I mean maybe Scott has a thought about whether it's going to be possible to separate trade and security in the end, but right now we're going in the opposite direction.</p><p>Scott Miller: Well, in the column of great minds think alike, I would note that at the end of February, former Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson spoke at CSIS and in his address, he specifically identified what he called the tech cold war as not only the flash point in the relationship between the U.S. and China, but that the tension would spill out into other areas. So, I think both Bill and the secretary are right about that. Look, I think that this is the one area ... I look around this town for signs of bipartisanship, and there are very few except for two areas regulating big tech and dealing with China. That has current bipartisan credence at this point, and I think the American people not only recognize that China is an unfair trader, which clearly comes out in all the polling, so there is reluctance of the American people to push back on the president's trade actions with China, but also the security threat I think is real and Chinese behavior here is really making the case. You don't have to have to like President Trump or listen to what he says. You just read the paper and see what's happening from China and you realize we have to do something about this.</p><p>Jack Caporal: So do you think there is a chance that Trump and Xi get together, sit at the table, you know, they're in Japan and President Trump makes an offer and Xi says, \"Well, you know, the offer's pretty good, but if we accept this deal, what's stopping you from slapping export restrictions and basically hamstringing our high tech sector outside of the confines of the deal,\" and things just kind of fall apart?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: The Chinese have always tried to insist on commitments from us, not only not to do that, but to liberalize our controls on tech transfer.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: I mean, they've been conveying that message for 25 years. When I was in the government and met with them, it was in the Clinton administration, it was the same thing. Then they linked it to the deficit. You want the deficit to go down, sell us more high tech. The message hasn't changed, and no administration has bought that. Clinton didn't buy it. Bush didn't buy it. Obama didn't buy it, and Trump is certainly not going to buy it. If they make it a condition of the deal, then it seems to me it's going to be very hard to get a deal.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes, that could make things worse. I'm personally skeptical that that happens in a leaders' meeting, but it's likely to play out after the Osaka meeting.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It would demand a grasp of detail that we're not entirely confident our president has.</p><p>Scott Miller: That's exactly why I'm suspicious of it.</p><p>Jack Caporal: No, that's fair enough.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: You were more tactful than I was though.</p><p>Jack Caporal: So, there's also, like Bill, as you mentioned, there's the rest of the G20 that's happening, right? That really is the main event, and so on the agenda is WTO reform. Japanese Prime Minister Abe has this whole push for discussion on digital economy governance that he calls Data Free Flow with Trust. Then an issue that seemingly always pops up at these meetings with the Trump administration is whether or not the final joint statement, what kind of language on trade will be in the joint statement, whether there's language on fighting protectionism or embracing free and open trade. I mean, is there a risk that these issues are just overshadowed by kind of everything else that's happening? Not just U.S.-China, but I mean there are a lot of global issues going on. Is there a risk that there is just no common ground on issues like WTO reform and digital governance?</p><p>Scott Miller: Well sure, because there isn't. I mean look, sorry for being the skeptic of the gang, but the G20 was formed at a period of crisis, during the global financial crisis, 2008, roughly speaking, was the first meeting, and for a while provided some useful cooperation, especially among G20 finance ministers. Because we had a global crisis, world finance is a matrix, and coordination was required, and it seemed to help. Really, since that time, the G20 has completely and convincingly demonstrated its inability to do much of anything. I think there just are the same diverse opinions. I mean, how do you have a meeting on advancing the digital economy when you have the United States, China, and India in the same room, or ... you know, they are all G20 members and there is no process or agreement or treaty that says we have to accomplish something. So different points of view get stated and nothing gets resolved. That's been the story of the G20 for about a dozen years. Look, hats off to the Prime Minister of Japan for hosting the meeting. It's a pain, it's difficult, it's work, and I appreciate an ambitious agenda, but I think it's going the way of lots of other ambitious agendas.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: What's sad about it is it's sort of another blow for multilateralism. Plug my column this week which discusses this in a little bit of detail. I think one of the things that we need to be focusing on, and the G20 has tended to focus on, although less so with Trump, has been global problems, and global commons problems, so, climate change. The problem of overfishing has been a WTO multilateral problem. Epidemics. The new one, plastic pollution in the oceans. I mean these are all multi-nation problems. They're caused by multiple nations, and the effects affect a whole bunch of other nations, many of whom have nothing to do with causing the problem. They're the victims, because the plastic washes up on their shores, or the dirty air blows over their atmosphere. And we seem to be moving into an era, well back into an era where might makes right, and everyone for himself. And if you're big and strong that you do better. Although I think it's a closer question than it used to be, at least for the United States. But what gets lost in that whole transition are these global problems. No one nation can fix climate change. Our government seems not even to be interested in it. But even if we are, China being a good example, because it's a political issue there, because they've had so many pollution problems, they can't solve the problem by themselves ... and what we're losing, by the failure of not just the G20, but all the multilateral organizations, is our ability to cope with all that. End of rant, sorry.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Scott, you said the G20 is born out of a time of crisis, and it seems like, you know, Bill has pointed to five or six different crises. The WTO is definitely at a hinge moment, it's at a pivotal moment, and it's on the agenda. You could argue that there's a crisis in terms of how digital governance is being shaped, right, it's kind of an \"every nation for themselves\" exporting models like EGDPR, and then you have China at the other end of the spectrum. And so I just want to push you a little further. There are crises, and are you saying the countries aren't up to the task?</p><p>Scott Miller: Well, the forum has not demonstrated capability. So what I would do, if I were the G20 czar, I'd pick a problem and actually fix it. So for me, fishery subsidies is the low-hanging fruit among the ones Bill listed, because you can debate about Earth's temperature in 30 years, and have lots of pleasant conversations or unpleasant conversations about it. But there's really not any debate that we now have the technology to basically remove every fish from the ocean, okay? And that would be a bad thing for people.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Not to mention the fish.</p><p>Scott Miller: Not to mention the fish. Yeah, the fish wind up, they're going to wind up as dinner one way or another if we have our way. But we can literally fish out the oceans. That's what maritime technology has evolved to, and that it's in all our interests to not do that. So that one's a very practical problem. And so for me, if I wanted to demonstrate the organization's value, I would find a problem that is solvable, or at least addressable, in cooperation with say, the WTO. WTO fishery subsidies have been on the agenda since I'm pretty sure Seattle, 1999 is the first time they were on. So this is not a new problem. It's not one that lacks definition. And it is one that as technology evolved ... fishery technology, it is clearly a threat to not just fish, but human beings, given the proportion of the diet. So, go do something and make it actually, make it happen, make it stick. And build the reputation of the group, and move on to other problems then.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: You know this brings back uncomfortable memories, because when the EU-U.S. relationship was running into headwinds in the Bush administration, and some CEOs came in to the president and talked about revitalizing the relationship, that led to a discussion between the commission and the White House over, \"What do we do?\" and the answer was, \"Let's pick one thing. And let's see if we can make that one thing work. And then we build on that.\" Well the one thing they picked was chickens.</p><p>Scott Miller: Oh my goodness, I had no idea.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It is now 15 years ... that was the EU's idea, it wasn't our idea, and now 15 years later we still have a chicken problem. So, I'm not optimistic. The other reason I'm frustrated is on fishery subsidies. To the WTO's great credit, they have done exactly what you suggested. They've flagged it, identified it, and targeted it as the big accomplishment for their next ministerial, which will be about a year from now in Kazakhstan. Not exactly an ocean state, but that's all right.</p><p>Scott Miller: That'll be all right.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: But, you know, they are now getting down to more serious negotiations. And what has happened most recently is the Indians have come in, to the surprise of no one, and suggested we need to have a system here that exempts developing countries.</p><p>Scott Miller: Well what an opportunity for the 19 other leaders of the G20 to browbeat the Indians at this week's meeting.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yeah, we'll see. I hope that's what happens, and I hope you're right. But I'll be surprised.</p><p>Scott Miller: Like I said, we're looking for a measure of effectiveness. It's hard to find.</p><p>Jack Caporal: So, pessimistic about the G20, maybe a little pessimistic about fishery subsidies despite that being a UN Sustainable Development Goal, and they've been given direction by world leaders to come to an agreement by the end of the year. And now you have a developing country saying that all developing countries deserve exemptions despite the fact that I think over ... that would include China, which is the largest economy by fish capture, you know a ton of other developing countries in the top 20 in terms of fish capture, so ...</p><p>Bill Reinsch: There's a huge frustration for me about the logic of this argument, because what the developing countries will say, and they say it about climate change and pollution is, \"You rich countries are the problem. You've been polluting, you've been building factories, you've been using coal for 100 years. It's all your fault.\" And then they basically say, \"Now it's our turn.\" Which is tantamount to saying, \"All right, you guys have been stupid for 100 years, so now it's our turn to be stupid.\" And the loser is the global commons.</p><p>Scott Miller: So perhaps restate the argument, and rather than exclude developing countries, basically have it only apply to modern technology. So, if you've got a wooden boat, and three people on it, and no mechanization, fish all you want, okay? But if you're using modern technology that is capable of really destroying fish stocks, then you've got to be part of the disciplines.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Sure.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Which would capture the Chinese for sure.</p><p>Scott Miller: Right, yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: We've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole. I've noticed that Bill is also wearing a fish tie, a salmon fish tie today, which is somewhat coincidental.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Indeed, I'm wearing this because Andrew told me that it looks good on TV. And I did TV this morning. So, I'm following his advice implicitly.</p><p>Jack Caporal: What channel were you on?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Well I was almost on MSNBC, and then they realized I was in the wrong studio, because I was supposed to be on CNBC, which is where I ended up. Talking about what we were talking about. China and Xi and Trump.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yeah. It's the news. Let's shelve fisheries for a minute. That's like a whole other podcast in and of itself, it's very complicated, and turn maybe to USMCA, which is still the issue du jour in terms of what's on the U.S. trade agenda domestically. And U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer was on the Hill last week making the case for USMCA. He told lawmakers that he would do whatever it takes to get them onboard, specifically Democrats, when it comes to their concerns with enforcement. But you have the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, the Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over trade issues in the House, saying, \"There's not a chance that lawmakers will take up the agreement before the August recess.\" Some folks have seen the August recess as kind of an informal deadline to consider the agreement before it gets sucked into the vortex of the 2020 election cycle. So is he basically foreclosing ... Mr. Blumenauer, is he basically foreclosing the chance that we're going to see a vote on USMCA before the election?</p><p>Scott Miller: Well, believe it or not I'm not that pessimistic anymore. Okay. I actually think ...</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Aha! You've been listening to me!</p><p>Scott Miller: Or I've been paying attention to events, maybe, as well as listening to you, which I always do. But look, first, Mexico ratified it this week. So, the Mexican Congress approved USMCA. That's one out of three. The Canadians are prepared to move forward, even if Prime Minister Trudeau has to recall the parliament.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And they're just waiting for us.</p><p>Scott Miller: And they're basically waiting for us to move, so that's good.</p><p>Jack Caporal: But the Canadians still do have a tight schedule, right? They have an election in October, and the latest they can recall the parliament is before their election period begins, which is late September.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: They have to dissolve the parliament in September, so it really is in the next couple of months.</p><p>Scott Miller: The window is not forever, but it is not August 1. And in terms of the August recess, look, having lobbied on enough issues. Floor managers for either party want to make tough issues right before a big break. So you basically back the vote up, don't let members leave town, okay, make them vote. All right so that's the popularity of doing it before a big recess. And then lots of things happen while you're out on recess, and by the time the fall rolls around, everybody's forgotten and moved on to the next outrage. So, now look. This still remains complicated in the Democratic Caucus in the House. I note that there are 134 members of Ms. Pelosi's caucus, so over half, who have never cast a recorded vote on a trade agreement. So this is new for a lot of Democrats. It's going to take some time to work, and I'm actually most encouraged by the fact that Chairman Neal, of the Ways and Means Committee, has formed a working group to deal with the very specific issues that Democrats have raised and to work directly with Ambassador Lighthizer to fix that. That says to me, that's a plan to get to a \"yes\" between the administration and House Democrats. Once that happens, I think, you're able to make the rest of the things move pretty well.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Sure. Let me just push back on one point you made, which is they could do it after the August recess, but when they get back, they have to do the budget, then they have to do the debt ceiling. Right? Before Christmastime essentially? And those are some major fights, and those are some major political issues as well.</p><p>Scott Miller: Well this is why they pay big salaries to members of Congress, and they have beautiful views of the National Mall from their offices. It's going to be hard work, okay? And they haven't done a lot of legislating this year so far. Devoted a lot to oversight and those kind of things. Appropriations are with us always. So my view is, once the Speaker and the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee feel they have a grasp of a ... whatever the number of votes both \"aye\" votes and people who aren't going to sort of break up the party over it, when they get comfortable with that, then we're going to be ready to move, and it's going to be ... what's happened in the past is trade agreements actually move very fast once you reach that threshold. So it's actually not a lot of floor time, it's not a lot of effort. You don't have a problem with a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. There's lots of things that allow this to move faster rather than slower, once you decide you're ready to move.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Exactly, I think the last one moved in 11 days after it was set up, as I seem to recall. And Scott is exactly right. You can't amend it, you can't put a hold on it, you can't filibuster it, you know there are time limits.</p><p>Scott Miller: So you fight about other things.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: There's not that much to do. So the delay so frontloaded. Which is what's going on right now. You have to work everything out because once the bill comes up it cannot be changed. And I still think that they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do right now, they're addressing these issues. They set up a structure for addressing these issues. Once they've reached an agreement, I think then the bill comes up and it moves along fairly quickly.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yeah, and for me the best politics of this is to deal with it, put it in the rearview mirror, and move on to the next issue. Because come time for 2020 elections, no one will remember that it got done. There'll be people who are concerned if it didn't get done, mostly traders, you know, who have dealt with uncertainty. But I don't think there's much retribution being dealt out a year from now.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And no one will care whether it got done in July or it got done in October.</p><p>Scott Miller: Exactly.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: We had Mr. Blumenauer here like six weeks ago or something like that, and the same issue came up. And he was more evasive on the August question, but clearly skeptical about August, but did say that if you do it in the fall ... it was doable in the fall. He said if it went into 2020-</p><p>Scott Miller: Eh, maybe it's a problem.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: ... then it would be toast.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And I think the election argument, probably, that kicks in around the New Hampshire primary. But I think in the fall ... it's still time to do this.</p><p>Jack Caporal: I might be a little bit more pessimistic just because ... the number of fights that they're going to have in the fall, I think-</p><p>Scott Miller: Well, come on-</p><p>Jack Caporal: ... you're going to throw in more-</p><p>Scott Miller: ... we're fighting about everything. Okay?</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yeah, the budget's a big fight.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: And then throwing this in the mix ...</p><p>Bill Reinsch: But the difference is there's a whole bunch of games you can play with those.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And there's amendments, and you can hold them up, and there's all kinds of brinkmanship. With this bill, once it comes up, there's a timetable. The committee gets so many days. The floor gets so many days. The Senate gets so many days. You can't change anything.</p><p>Scott Miller: That's why pro-traders moved heaven and earth to get TPA in 2015.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Right.</p><p>Scott Miller: That's why it's so important, and we might as well use it to pay off.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Okay. But there's still work that needs to be done to get the bill-</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes.</p><p>Scott Miller: Oh, yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: ... on the floor, right?</p><p>Scott Miller: Oh, yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: And so Lighthizer last week says he's willing to do basically whatever it takes. He tells congressional Democrats he's willing to do whatever it takes to get them on board with the agreement. But at the same time, the administration has said they're unwilling to reopen the agreement, and Democrats are saying, \"We need changes to the text.\" So-</p><p>Scott Miller: We'll find out.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Where's the middle ground there?</p><p>Scott Miller: Well, look, this is one of Bill's landmines. One of Bill's landmines is the overreach of Democrats. It's still possible. I think this working group or committee makes it less likely, not more likely. And I also think that, look, this is something that once they've decided it's going to happen, they'll try to find a way to do it. Now, politics are still complicated. And the fact that a lot of people who are members of Congress now have not voted on a trade agreement, will make this very difficult and challenging for the people on, say, the majority whip and the minority whip's teams to pin down members and make sure you have the votes to pass.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Every administration says they won't reopen, and every administration reopens. They say they won't until the last possible minute. And then if that's the choice-</p><p>Scott Miller: If they have to, they do.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: They do, and they try to contain it and limit it. People don't see this, but in a way, the whole debate has been substantially limited already. There are four subcommittees. They're doing four issues. Everything else has been pushed aside.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Where is ISDS? Where are regional vegetables? Where is dairy? It's-</p><p>Scott Miller: No longer for discussion.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Right.</p><p>Scott Miller: No longer.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It's focused in labor, environment, enforcement, and drugs.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yep.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And that's a lot. Those are not simple issues, but it's only four, where it could have been 15. And so, in a way, without ever anybody standing up and saying, \"Well, we've thrown all these things under the bus.\" Nobody ever stands up and says that. But de facto, that's what's happened.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: They're focusing on four things, and when they're satisfied on those four things, then we move forward.</p><p>Scott Miller: Right. No stern letters being written on anything else right at the moment.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Right. No, that's true.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And there will be six or seven House members who stand up and say ... the Florida delegation will stand up and say, \"They've screwed my tomato people, and I'm voting no.\"</p><p>Jack Caporal: So be it.</p><p>Scott Miller: That's 29 members. It just takes 218 to pass. All right? It's all you need.</p><p>Jack Caporal: So we're thinking this gets done before 2020, and then we're in election season. We get a taste of that this week with the first Democratic debates. It's a packed stage. There are about a million Democratic-</p><p>Scott Miller: 25 candidates.</p><p>Jack Caporal: ... candidates. Well, there are a lot.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It will be 24 as of this week.</p><p>Scott Miller: Oh, okay.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Joe Sestak joined the pack.</p><p>Scott Miller: I thought he was number 25. I guess I've lost count.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: He was 24, I think.</p><p>Scott Miller: Okay.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It was 23 ... 20 in the debate. 10 and 10.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yes. Over two nights. Yes.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: And they have ... you would expect trade to come up at the debates. And the candidates, in my opinion, have a range of views on trade. So you have some more free trade type folks like Joe Biden, and maybe Pete Buttigieg, and some of the senators. And then, on the other end of the spectrum, you have folks like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who are almost aligned with the president on many issues. So, is there going to be some infighting within the Democratic Party? Does the party need to do some soul searching to figure out where they stand on trade before they get to the big kahuna in facing the president?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: It's always a debate during the nomination process. There was a big debate amongst the Democrats in the '16 nomination between Bernie and Hillary on this. In the end, they didn't end up that far apart, at least on paper. But it was a big issue in the debate. It was a big issue when Obama was running in '08, but then it faded in the general. It tends to be a nomination issue for Democrats and then fade because it's not really something that they like to talk about. This election will be different because it's a signature issue for Trump. So he won't let it fade, and so the Democrats have to deal with it whether they want to or not. There is some common ground. Plug here, we are putting out today an issue brief on the Democrats and trade, or actually all the ... including the one Republican, the non-Trump candidate, on trade, a lot of quotes about what they say and some analysis that ... it doesn't land anywhere. It just helps you understand what they think. So, it's a good guide going into the debate. There is common ground. One is they all think Trump is going about it the wrong way. Implementation is terrible. Most of them don't like the tariffs because they read the polls like everybody else, and understand the polls are negative on tariffs. And the positive thing they all say is he's not building coalitions, and that trade is inherently an issue where you need to line up as many friends as you can, particularly on China, and get them all saying the same thing at the same time and working together. And we're not doing that. And I think that's, first of all, it's a compelling criticism, a good one, and it's one they'll make. Beyond that, there's a breakdown, exactly what you said. Biden, of course, has had eight years with Obama and a long record in the Senate where he voted for a lot of these agreements. And I think he's going to stand on his record. Some of the governors ... Hickenlooper is a good example. He's come up with a trade plan of his own, which is pro-trade. You've got Sanders and, actually, Warren who ... I've complained that Trump is stuck in the '50s. They're really trapped in the '30s. It's class warfare for them.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes. Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And trade is just one more element of how big companies cheat the workers. Warren has spelled this out I think more coherently than Sanders has, but it's the same point, which is trade is part of a larger inequality in our society in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And trade agreements are manifestations of ways in which large companies and powerful executives arrange things to their advantage and to the disadvantage of the worker. We'll see how far that gets. That was sort of Trump's policy as well.</p><p>Scott Miller: Sure. And I actually, as a bold prediction, I don't think the conversation gets very far this week in these debates for several reasons.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: They have a minute each.</p><p>Scott Miller: That's the most important one is there are 20 people on the stage, or 10 and 10, however they structure it. And you'll recall a little less than four years ago when there were 17 Republicans on the stage in their primary process. Issues weren't the definitive factor in the early stages. Second, also policy positions, with the exception of Senator Warren, are not as thoroughly developed at this point. So, the contrasts really haven't been drawn below the sort of the top line principles. So, I think we'll just see how this plays out. I don't think we'll learn much this weekend, but now that the process is kicking off, it's great we'll have something to talk about.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yes, that's true. Stay tuned.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: We will do ... our brief that's coming out today will be updated as the situation is refined. As people disappear from the list, it will get a little bit easier, and there'll be more pressure on them to come out with fully fleshed programs I think, particularly on trade, because Scott's right. It's all going to be sloganeering and, \"How do I stand out and make myself different?\"</p><p>Scott Miller: Who's the fairest of them all?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Who's the fairest of them all, well, or who's the most outrageous of them all?</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: That was how-</p><p>Scott Miller: That could work.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: ... Trump prevailed.</p><p>Scott Miller: That worked. Yeah.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: But Trump will ... this and immigration are signature issues for him.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: So, it's not going to go away, and the Democrats are going to have to confront it.</p><p>Scott Miller: There will have to be a contrast.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes. I think ... me too ... I've been saying this ever since he won. The Democrats are not going to be able to out-protectionist Trump.</p><p>Scott Miller: No. No, he's-</p><p>Bill Reinsch: He owns that particular thing.</p><p>Scott Miller: His credentials are now very strong. Okay?</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes.</p><p>Scott Miller: And if you want four more years of that, he's your guy.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yeah. They could argue that they're better for the worker, which is a-</p><p>Bill Reinsch: Yes, they can.</p><p>Jack Caporal: ... distinction with a difference.</p><p>Bill Reinsch: And I think they will.</p><p>Scott Miller: Yes, but they will have to provide a contrast-</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yes.</p><p>Scott Miller: ... and explain why.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yes.</p><p>Scott Miller: So it's going to be interesting.</p><p>Jack Caporal: Yes, for sure.

At the beginning of the decade, everyone hated the bankers and exulted the tech barons; as it draws to its close, everyone hates the tech barons and ignores the bankers. But amid all the uncertainty, one ancient profession has flourished: the fortune-teller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Naturally, modern fortune-tellers don't call themselves fortune-tellers - they prefer \"trend forecaster\" or \"futurologist\" or - sorry - \"lifestyle detective\". They usually do without the animal entrails and star charts, preferring to read the runes from makeup trends in Seoul, tech start-ups in Palo Alto and genetic experiments in Shenzhen. And they have made themselves as indispensable to 21st-century product designers and brand managers as astrologers once were to generals and kings. As Martin Raymond noted in his Trend Forecaster's Handbook of 2010, forecasting \"now underpins all aspects of society where it is important to understand the short-, medium- and long-term impact of new and emerging changes in the culture around us.\"</p><p>Raymond is the cofounder of the Future Laboratory, a consultancy based in Shoreditch, east London. His 60 or so co-workers write reports, host seminars and curate networks that are used by companies such as Google, L'Or\u00e9al, Sainsbury's, JaguarLand Rover and Ikea. He now looks back on the beginning of the decade - as the impact of the global financial crisis was beginning to be felt - as something of a golden age for forecasters.</p><p>\"If you remember the period around the year 2010, it was very uncertain,\" he says. \"We probably had our most successful period in our 20-year timeframe then - a lot of the trends that we are still measuring today emerged in that period.\"</p><p>Raymond's 2010 book - recently updated for a 2020 edition - applied a methodology to what might seem a numinous art. Forecasters will tend to identify a \"macrotrend\" - such as \"new sobriety\", the mood of no-frills seriousness that emerged after the crash - and then trace it from the innovators and early adopters through to the late adopters and refuseniks. They can then advise clients how the trend might affect their customers, and how best to deal with that.</p><p>One of the macrotrends identified by Future Laboratory at the outset of the decade was \"Bleisure\" ie, the blending of business and leisure. (The 2010s were, if nothing else, a decade of gross portmanteau words.) \"We saw more freelancers, more start-ups, more businesses promoting flexible working at the same time as more people were being laid off and having to fend for themselves,\" says Raymond. \"We saw the business sector responding to that, but also the hospitality sector, technology companies, fashion brands and so on. It's not forecasting exactly - it's just noticing.\"</p><p>Still, many of the specific examples cited as technologies of the future in the 2010 book haven't weathered so well. I still have no idea how to use a QR code or why I might want to. There is a design for a \"lilypad floating city\", a luxurious, eco-friendly floating island designed by the Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut as the sort of place where refugees might live in the event of climate catastrophe. The actual experience of refugees in the 2010s makes it seem horribly poignant.</p><p>Technology, as the saying goes, is stuff that doesn't work yet. But some examples of future tech were so nearly right. The \"muve gruve inactivity monitor\", a piece of wearable weight-loss technology that clips on to your belt, feeds data back into your phone, and prompts you to exercise via a series of buzzes and bleeps. The company that made it has long since disappeared - but the Fitbit did catch on. Raymond even stands by the Okes recycled oak bicycle that he suggested would be \"perfectly on-trend\" for hipsters in London, Amsterdam and New York. \"There was a huge growth in cycling at the time,\" he explains. \"It was part of the move towards small designers, artisanal products and counterintuitive materials. And bamboo bikes are quite a big deal in China you know!\"</p><p>Certainly, the forecasters who had their eye on Asia have tended to fare best in the predictions. From emojis and TikTok to gene editing and social credit, it's where many of the decade's key innovations have emerged. Mike Walsh, who runs the Los Angeles-based consultancy Tomorrow, published his book, Futuretainment, in 2009, inspired by spells in China, Japan and Korea. \"These places felt like they were already 10 years in the future,\" he says. \"Long before the iPhone existed, Asia had early smartphones and sophisticated forms of digital entertainment.\"</p><p>His book predicted the wide adoption of streaming, mass participation in esports and cloud-based entertainment (ie, you start watching a Netflix series on your TV at home and then pick up where you left off on your phone on the way to work). But there was a lot that he missed. \"I definitely underestimated the impact of drones,\" he says. \"And I had predicted we would see more live-streaming video eyewear. All the technology was invented, but in a way, live stories on Instagram were an alternate approach that replaced the idea.\"</p><p>Building an artificial reef of recycled plastic off the Suffolk coast might have addressed both waste and erosion</p><p>Indeed, if the decade has a signature flop, it is Google Glass, launched in prototype form in 2013. Its $1,500 price tag and dystopian privacy implications prompted a huge backlash against early adopters - \"glassholes\" - that anticipated the wider turn against the big tech companies. \"Google Glass quickly became a symbol of Silicon Valley ideology,\" says Dr Anders Sandberg, who researches the ethics of human enhancement at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. \"Concerns about privacy and so on came up very early.\" As a \"card-carrying transhumanist\" who is generally in favour of human enhancement, he founds this \"disappointing\" but instructive too.</p><p>It might seem logical to extrapolate from the smartphone and the miniaturisation of microchips and assume that the future will involve first wearable computers and then embedded computers. But that's reckoning without backlashes, taboos, moral panics, regulation and so on. It also underestimates the impact of actually existing technologies.</p><p>\"When we were talking about enhancement in 2010, we were still focused on biomedical enhancement,\" says Sandberg. \"I think we became overexcited about that. We hadn't realised that perhaps the more powerful enhancement was available at the Apple store.\" Technology doesn't have to alter the body to alter our minds. \"I would argue we are more than halfway to enhancement already - and smartphones should be regarded as extensions of our bodies,\" Sandberg continues. \"The effects of being online all the time are at least as disturbing as anything you can think of to do with genetic engineering or taking drugs.\"</p><p>***</p><p>But the immediate past blinds us to the near future too. We are obsessed with the social effects of technology - and complacent about the physical effects. Sandberg contrasts the outcry over genetic engineering after Dolly the Sheep was cloned in 1996 to the comparative \"meh\" that greeted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/28/scientist-in-china-defends-human-embryo-gene-editing\">Lula and Nana</url>, the world's first genetically modified humans, born in China last year. \"Important things have been happening on the biological side, particularly with regard to genetic engineering. But people don't seem to have been nearly as upset about it as I would have expected in 2010.\" It may simply be that we're too distracted by other things on our smartphones to pay attention.</p><p>Sandberg himself cautions against forecasting - \"empirically, it comes back to bite you\" - and says the safest prediction to make about the impact of any given new technology is \"no change\". Still, if you release enough helium balloons into the sky, one or two of them will float pretty far. Back in 1991, Dr ID Pearson was working as an engineer at BT when he was asked to prepare a report on the future of telecoms. He claims this is when he invented the text message - a landline-to-landline version, purely theoretical along with hundreds of other purely imaginary inventions, such as online dating, satnav and music streaming. \"I tried hard to get BT to take it seriously but the attitude I had was that this was a very stupid idea,\" he complains.</p><p>He remained BT's resident futurist until 2007, when he set up his own consultancy, Futurizon. He has since branched into materials science, fashion and politics. One of the ideas on his blog is \"dual democracy\": Labour voters could pay Labour taxes and receive Labour public services; Conservative voters could pay Conservative taxes and receive Conservative public services. He is disappointed that his local council decided against building an artificial reef from recycled plastic off the Suffolk coast, which he thought might solve plastic recycling and coastal erosion in one go. But he believes the \"big thing\" we're getting wrong at the moment is self-driving cars.</p><p>\"The current model is persevering because the car industry wants to keep selling people expensive cars,\" he says. \"But it would be so much cheaper to have the cars driven by smart infrastructure instead. Imagine a fibreglass pod with a seat inside it working on a linear induction mat where all the routing is done at each junction; the pod knows where you're going as you have your phone in your hand; all you need to do is make the mats and you could roll them out overnight.\" Simple!</p><p>Still, the main risk of forecasting is not being wrong - but being too early. Faith Popcorn (n\u00e9e Plotkin) has some claim to being the \"mother of futurism\", having been in the future business since 1978. She had a hand in the development of IBM's PS/1, the company's entry into home computing. She also claims to have coined the term \"flexitarian\" in 2008. \"I'll tell you something else we predicted,\" she tells me. \"I said people would buy things from the internet. The people at Procter &amp; Gamble laughed at us. It's not hard to predict these things. What's hard is to get companies to move in time.\"</p><p>She sees the meat-free Impossible Burger as the signature innovation of the 2010s. As for the 2020s, she maintains that implants will be the defining technology - despite any reservations you might have about, say, Mark Zuckerberg microchipping your child. \"We check the cookies boxes on websites, don't we?\" Sure, but there's an instant pay-off there and no physical cost. \"Isn't there an instant pay-off in never having to look for your keys again? Or not having to learn a new language? Or remember anything?\"</p><p>I am still sceptical - but so are a lot of people, she insists. \"So, we're testing this product at the moment and everyone is saying what you're saying: 'Privacy, blah blah blah.' But we created a chip that could be inserted into a child - a baby even - that could track them. We found that grandparents, especially, would pay up to $5,000 for this. And these are early days. Someday, it will get down to 25 cents and everyone will get one. What's a parent's greatest concern? It's their child disappearing. So when Facebook or whoever tell us that it's safe, we will want to believe. And we will do it.\"</p><p>Consider yourself warned.</p><p> If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine's letters page in print, please email <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/28/scientist-in-china-defends-human-embryo-gene-editing\">weekend@theguardian.com</url>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-58190763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-2JD1-JCJY-G072-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1919\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The changes will go into effect at midnight Monday and ratchet up pressure on Tehran while worsening a divide with Europe over diplomatic strategy.</p><p>Mr. Pompeo said the goal was to get Iran to end nuclear enrichment, curb weapons programs and end its support for American foes in the region.</p><p>_____</p><p>2. Rick Gates, Paul Manafort\u2019s right-hand man for years, began testifying against his former boss in federal court in Alexandria, Va.</p><p>He is considered the most important <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/rick-gates-manafort-trump-trial.html\">witness in Mr. Manafort\u2019s trial on tax and bank fraud</url>charges.

We welcome your feedback at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:morningbrief@foreignpolicy.com[1]\">morningbrief@foreignpolicy.com[1]</email>; Trump Threatens More Sanctions on IranU.S. President Donald Trump threatened[2] to 'substantially' increase U.S. sanctions on Iran as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held an emergency meeting on Wednesday. Iran has continued enriching uranium beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States backed out of last year. </p><p>While Trump has accused Iran of secretly enriching uranium before, the United States remains open to talks. What can Iran do? The IAEA confirmed[3] that Iran is enriching its uranium to 4.5 percent purity\u2014still very far from the 90 percent that would make it weapons-grade. (The limit set by the deal is 3.67 percent.) Iran insists is actions are in response to U.S. sanctions, and that it does not intend to make a nuclear weapon. It could respond to Trump's threats with further escalation. Pushback. While the IAEA convened the emergency meeting at Washington's request, U.S. representatives faced some pushback[4] from the remaining signatories to the deal: Russia, China, and Europe. They blame the Trump administration for the ongoing crisis. Britain, France, and Germany are struggling[5]\u2014but still hoping\u2014to resolve it through diplomacy. What We're Following TodayChemical weapons investigations to begin in Syria. A new chemical weapons team could soon begin investigations to attribute blame for nine alleged attacks during the course of the country's civil war, Reuters reports[6]. While Syria pledged to destroy its chemical weapons, attacks using chemical agents during the war have been common. It joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013, opening itself up to inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, but has refused to offer visas to the newly created team. Meanwhile, President Bashar al-Assad's forces are struggling[7] to defeat rebels in the country's northwest, where the insurgents enjoy Turkish support. Observers say government forces have stalled and could have trouble retaking the area by force. Brazil passes pension reform. Brazil's lower house has passed[8] a landmark reform to the pension system by a wide margin\u2014a big victory for President Jair Bolsonaro's government. The current pension system has created a huge budget gap that Bolsonaro has pledged to close. The vote came after months of political disagreement, with the bill's supporters accusing Bolsonaro of slowing the process down. It faces a final vote on Friday or Saturday. Von der Leyen faces challenge from EU Greens. Ursula von der Leyen, who comes from Europe's center-right, may face[9] a challenge in the EU Parliament to secure her appointment as the next Commission head. Despite her climate promises, she won't have the support of the Greens. To get an absolute majority, she will need the center-left. Trump hosts social media summit\u2014without big tech. U.S. President Donald Trump hosts[10] a social media summit today at the White House, but representatives for the big platforms\u2014Facebook, Twitter, and Google\u2014haven't been invited. Trump has accused the platforms of political bias, and could use the meeting to signal future action against the big companies. Keep an Eye OnThe Strait of Hormuz. Three Iranian ships attempted to block[11] a British oil tanker as it attempted to pass through the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran. A British warship, the HMS Montrose, intervened and pointed its guns at the Iranian vessels, which then turned away, according to reports. Iran's Revolutionary Guards denied involvement but the move could be a retaliation for Britain's seizure of an Iranian vessel off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The British government issued a statement urging Iran'to de-escalate the situation in the region.' Russia's expanding influence in Africa. Last week, two employees of an infamous Russian media manager were detained[12] in Libya and accused of trying to influence the country's elections. The incident offer a glimpse into the diffuse and evolving nature of Russia's influence operations around the world\u2014and its expansion into Africa, Amy Mackinnon reports[13]. Solidarity with Xinjiang's Uighurs. Twenty-two countries have submitted[14] a joint letter to the president of the U.N. Human Rights Council rebuking China for the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. The group includes Australia, Britain, Canada, and Japan. (The United States backed out of the forum last year.) Muslim leaders have not been so quick to condemn China, Azeem Ibrahim writes[15] for FP. Dubai's royal family. Last week, news broke that Princess Haya bint al-Hussein\u2014one of the six wives of Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum\u2014had fled the royal family. Her departure lends legitimacy to previous allegations of abuse within the family and could harm the UAE's image, Ola Salem writes[16] for FP. Airbus vs. Boeing. Europe's Airbus is now projected[17] to surpass Boeing as the world's top plane manufacturer this year after the U.S. company reported a 37 percent decrease in deliveries. Boeing's output has taken a hit since regulators grounded its popular 737 Max jet after deadly disasters involving Ethiopian Airlines and Indonesia's Lion Air. Taiwan's 2020 election. Taiwan's opposition party is currently holding a primary by phone poll to decide who will face off against President Tsai Ing-wen next year. Tsai, who visits the United States this week, has received a reelection boost from increasing Chinese aggression, Hilton Yip writes[18] for FP. Odds and EndsInterpol and customs officials in 109 countries have announced[19] that in June they conducted the largest anti-wildlife trafficking operation in history, seizing thousands of live endangered animals: turtles and tortoises, cats, apes, and reptiles. The crackdown led to 582 arrests. A bishop in Colombia will perform[20] an exorcism by helicopter this weekend, sprinkling holy water over the entire city of Buenaventura from above. The bishop seeks to combat high rates of drug crime and violence. 'We have to drive the devil out of Buenaventura,' he said. An energy company in Russia is warning[21] tourists to stay away from a turquoise lake\u2014known on Instagram as the 'Siberian Maldives'\u2014because it's filled with dangerous metal oxides from a coal ash dump site. The warnings appear only to have attracted more visitors. A neighbor of New ZealandPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confessed publicly to (unintentionally) killing her cat more than a year after the first feline, Paddles, was found run over by a car near Ardern's Auckland home. The neighbor reportedly apologized and sent a condolence card.That's it for today. For more from FP, subscribe here[22] or sign-up[23] for our other newsletters.

The probe will include a series of hearings and will give lawmakers an opportunity to seek information from the companies about their practices through requests and subpoenas.</p><p>The committee announced the probe would focus on three areas: documenting where competition is lacking in digital markets, exploring whether large companies are suppressing competition, and determining whether Congress and regulators need to do more to address Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>\"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive,\" Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, said in a statement, adding, \"Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action.\"</p><p>The news comes as regulators are also reportedly setting themselves up for a broad investigation into Silicon Valley. In recent days, media outlets have reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) agreed to divvy up the largest tech companies into their respective jurisdictions.</p><p>The FTC would reportedly have the responsibility of investigating Facebook and Amazon, while the DOJ could pursue Google and Apple. It's unclear whether there are any investigations in the works, but the reports sent the companies' stocks tumbling Monday.</p><p>If Congress decides that the rules need changing, tech companies could have even more to fear.</p><p>\"This is the first time there's been an investigation of this magnitude in decades, and frankly it's long overdue,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, told reporters on Monday. - FNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2234545796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF8-W991-DY0W-43Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The probe will include a series of hearings and will give lawmakers an opportunity to seek information from the companies about their practices through requests and subpoenas.</p><p>The committee announced the probe would focus on three areas: documenting where competition is lacking in digital markets, exploring whether large companies are suppressing competition, and determining whether Congress and regulators need to do more to address Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>\"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive,\" Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, said in a statement, adding, \"Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action.\"</p><p>The news comes as regulators are also reportedly setting themselves up for a broad investigation into Silicon Valley. In recent days, media outlets have reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) agreed to divvy up the largest tech companies into their respective jurisdictions.</p><p>The FTC would reportedly have the responsibility of investigating Facebook and Amazon, while the DOJ could pursue Google and Apple. It's unclear whether there are any investigations in the works, but the reports sent the companies' stocks tumbling Monday.</p><p>If Congress decides that the rules need changing, tech companies could have even more to fear.</p><p>\"This is the first time there's been an investigation of this magnitude in decades, and frankly it's long overdue,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, told reporters on Monday. - FNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-CFS1-JB5P-J009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This offers yet another reminder why we must resist calls from liberals and nationalist conservatives alike to give the government increased power over the web. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The threat of a violent crackdown on protesters looms after demonstrations began on Saturday. The unrest arose after the revelation that the Iranian military accidentally shot down a passenger aircraft, killing all 176 people on board, including Ukrainians and Iranians alike. Thousands took to the street, protesting the regime and chanting, \u201cDeath to the dictator.\u201d Now, government forces have started shooting protesters. </p><p>Meanwhile, the country\u2019s authoritarian crackdown on technology threatens to make the situation much, much worse. According to Newsweek, parts of the country are now experiencing suspiciously-timed internet outages, raising alarms in light of the Iranian internet infrastructure being state-run. So, too, the regime will reportedly consider mandating a complete structural shift from an internet to an intranet. This would cut off access for millions and force everyone else onto the wired intranet connections it controls and has previously used to \u201csilence protesters and quell unrest.\u201d </p><p>Here\u2019s how tech publication Wired explained the regime\u2019s past repressive practices:</p><p>Increasingly over the past decade, the Iranian regime has focused on building out a centralized national \"intranet.\" That allows it to provide citizens with web services while policing all content on the network and limiting information from external sources ... In the process of establishing this internal web, the Iranian regime has taken more and more control over both public and private connectivity in the name of national security.</p><p>Specific examples reveal the terrifying consequences of such concentrated government control.</p><p>For example, in 2009, the Iranian regime simply \"turned off\" the internet in many parts of the country to quell unrest that emerged as a result of that year's elections. And it interfered with the 2013 election as well, by blocking websites containing certain keywords and candidates' names. In a more recent example, in 2018, the Iranian regime blocked the popular messaging service Telegram in a blatant attempt to shut down critics' communications. It also launched a crackdown on the virtual private networks citizens were using to circumvent censorship tools. </p><p>The technicalities and specifics involved in this kind of internet censorship are quite complicated, but the lesson is clear: Granting government power over the free flow of information is a recipe for abuse. </p><p>The Iranian example offers an important warning against the kind of big-government policies proposed by socialist presidential aspirants such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and a poignant reminder as to why we should never grant the state control over the internet. Of course, most Democrats aren\u2019t calling for an all-out takeover of the web, but some are getting dangerously close. </p><p>Sanders, for instance, has called internet access a \u201chuman right\u201d and thus believes it should be a \u201cpublicly owned utility.\u201d As I previously described his formal campaign plan, \u201cThe senator ... would essentially have the federal government take control of the internet in almost Orwellian fashion.\u201d</p><p>And Warren has repeatedly called for big government to step in and \u201cbreak up\u201d Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google. </p><p>This isn\u2019t as extreme as a complete government takeover, but the Massachusetts Democrat and socialist-lite presidential candidate has nonetheless said she thinks Silicon Valley should be subjected to the whims and dictates of Washington bureaucrats. Sadly, in this desire to see government heavily involved in the internet, Warren is joined by some anti-tech conservatives, such as Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. </p><p>Plus, pretty much every elected Democrat supports reinstating \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the unnecessary regulation of internet service providers that was instituted under the Obama administration. Support for various levels of state control of the internet has become commonplace on the Left, and, increasingly, on the nationalist Right as well. </p><p>But sensible observers should look at the way Iran has used state control of the internet to oppress its people and reject these proposals. No, none of the Democrats' individual policies would turn our online experience into an Iranian nightmare overnight. Yet they would all shift the needle substantially toward state control, paving the way for further expansion of government power and future abuses. The Iranian example makes it clear that the only way to preserve a free and open internet is to keep the government as far away from it as possible. </p><p>Photo Caption:Web site blocked concept, girl with tablet pc on blurred nature background</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2337002499</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y03-YTJ1-DY0W-4097-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

All ahead, right now. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we have breaking news this morning, Iran's naval chief is threatening the United States, saying that his country is capable of shooting down more American drones, this as the United States is planning to implement additional sanctions on Tehran, as soon as today, the European allies urging both sides to show restraint.</p><p>Oil prices meanwhile, are moving higher this morning, on the news. Take a look after last week's 8 percent surge, oil now up another three-quarters of one percent this morning, at 57.87.</p><p>Markets in terms of stocks, take a look at indications here, Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, Dow Future up 59 points, a quarter of a percent right now, and the S&amp;P Futures up seven, and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 26.</p><p>Joining me right now is former National Security Council Chief of Staff, Center for Policy President and CEO, Fred Fleitz, Fred, good to have you on the program, this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FRED FLEITZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Characterize the situation with Tehran right now?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, you know, the President is struggling with two factors, his promise to get the U.S. out of wars and not to start new wars, and his realization he may have to take military action against Iran. Iran dodged a bullet last week. And look, all this (INAUDIBLE) by Iranian leaders that we can attack the U.S. or hurt it badly, the U.S. could flatten Iran if it had to.</p><p>The President pulled out of this fraudulent nuclear deal, and this argument that the U.S. is somehow responsible for these increase in tensions. Look, Iran's behavior got worse after the nuclear deal was announced and the argument that, you know, we're responsible for Iran's threats and belligerent activities.</p><p>The U.S. does not remain in agreement because the other state threatens violence and terrorism, if we withdraw. That would be giving in to blackmail. Our policy's working right now. The ball is in Iran's court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what do you want Iran to do, I mean, in their court?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, first of all, the U.S. should keep policy it has, because we're denying funds around which spent on terrorism, on meddling in Middle East conflicts, on the troops that Iran has sent into Syria, Iran's going to have to stop the belligerent activity and decide it is time to start negotiations. But if it isn't, we can simply stay the course, our policy is succeeding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday, I spoke with House Armed Services Committee Member Congressman Mike Turner, who said this about the future military action against Tehran should that become really part of the single conversation, so listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that the only leverage after all of these sanctions to have some kind of a military situation?</p><p>REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, I think the President has said and certainly Secretary Pompeo has said that all options are on the table, which includes a military response, and certainly to the extent that Iran has increased its military attacks within the area both on tankers and U.S. drones.</p><p>We might see in the future that need for a military response, I think it's great that the President showed restraint as a result of the downing of the U.S. drone, but what the President is making clear both with the build-up in the area and with his planning for action is, the President would not hesitate to use military force.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what about that, Fred, would you recommend military force, when the President doesn't want to go to war, but what if Iran keeps up these provocations?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, first of all, the President decided that killing 1 to 200 people in retaliation for downing an unarmed drone was unjustified. I think that was a right call. We should have a chief executive who is very careful and thoughtful in taking steps like this.</p><p>And it worries me there are so many people on the right who want to go to war with Iran, they want to knock out Iran's oil refineries and basically plaster them. We have to have very good justification for doing that. The President is ready to do that if necessary. He's trying to show restraint, I give him a lot of credit for that.</p><p>And Maria, you know there are a lot of people in this country on the right and left who do not want another war and I think the President is proceeding very carefully on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and we have seen Iran's economy really get impacted quite a bit by these sanctions, it's continuing to dive. We are watching a lot of economic data, this week, here in the U.S., earnings much anticipated, G20 summit as well, in Osaka, Japan.</p><p>The President is going to be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two countries, of course, the trading passes there. The U.S. is also reportedly considering requiring all 5G equipment for domestic use being made outside of China. What's your take in terms of what might get down at the G20 meeting, first off, between the President and President Xi?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, I think the exchange that everyone is looking at is the Xi- Trump meeting and what will this -- what will this mean, in terms of a possible future economic deal. And we know the Trump administration is doing everything possible to facilitate a productive outcome.</p><p>You know, Mike Pence is supposed to give a big speech today, bashing China, but the vice president called it off because trying to set the stage to get China to make the decision that it really wants a deal, we are in a much better position, economically, to get a deal. We know China's economy is hurting for a variety of reasons. This meeting may come at just the right time for a big breakthrough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe, but I mean, they reneged on some of the big-ticket items such as continued theft of intellectual property, the forced transfer of technology, can the President do a deal without the Chinese committing on those two issues?</p><p>FLEITZ: No, those are necessary. And I think there is some dissent within the Chinese government on the concessions they had agreed to earlier. And I also suspect they thought that we want a deal so badly, we'll simply go along with them, back-tracking.</p><p>Well, President Trump isn't going to go along with that. He said he just doesn't want a good deal, he wants a great deal. And I think this is going to be an opportunity for the two presidents to talk about the key issues that concern both of them and these are things President Trump is not going to back away from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And do you see the Chinese actually committing to that?</p><p>FLEITZ: I'm hoping that the Chinese will commit to continue to talk and to discuss these issues. I don't -- I don't know that we will get a breakthrough on issues such as theft and intellectual property at the meeting, but the fact that China had been talking about them and it looks like there had been an agreement, I think it gives them hope that we can get some movement on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because this is as much a security threat, a national security issue, as it is an economic deal, right Fred? I mean, the Chinese want to overtake the U.S. as the super power when it comes to the military.</p><p>FLEITZ: That's right. Well, look, when China was allowed into the global economic system, we thought that it would play fair, it never has played fair. It has exploited international trade. It has set-up a mercantile system where it maximizes exports and tries to import as little as possible, and then to steal technology, it's the worst case of mercantilism in history.</p><p>And it's about time that a world leader has called China on it, and look, other states are looking at this too. The Europeans have pressed China on the same issues and it's annoying the Chinese because they realize that President Trump has started something, globally, to force the Chinese to start practicing fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a really good point. Fred it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much.</p><p>FLEITZ: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fred Fleitz joining us there. Meanwhile, there's this, a Missouri police officer shot dead, Cheryl Casone with the details there and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. Good morning, Maria. Officer Michael Langsdorf was killed in the line of duty overnight. He had been on the job for just three months. This makes 22 police officers killed in the line of duty so far this year.</p><p>He was shot by somebody trying to cash a bad check. Officials say the suspect is in custody and then a gun has been recovered at the scene.</p><p>Well, a major protest in Prague, to tell you about, an estimated 250,000 people took to the streets calling for the resignation of the country's prime minister. The billionaire leader, who is being called Czech Trump by some media outlets there, is accused of fraud involving E.U. funds. Now, the event was built as the largest protest since the fall of communism, there.</p><p>Well, Bitcoin soaring passed the 11,000-dollar mark for the first time, in 15 months, look at this, 10,908 but it was above 11,000 earlier, digital currency is up 170 percent so far this year. Analysts (INAUDIBLE) that the latest boost is coming from Facebook's Libra crypto currency project.</p><p>Bitcoin hit a record high of over $19,000 though, back in late 2017, one of the many things that you covered while you were in France and welcome back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Yes, you know, the head of the Facebook crypto currency unit told us it is also good for Bitcoin because it, sort of, legitimizes the sector.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting reaction there from Bitcoin investors, Cheryl. Thanks.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up big technology is on the hill this morning, new bipartisan legislation looks to put a price tag on your personal data. Several congressmen and senators are coming up with legislation to protect your data, coming up. Then Wal-Mart cracks down on theft, a look at how it's using Artificial Intelligence to do just that, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have a big show this morning. Coming up, Florida congressman, former Green Beret and former White House policy adviser for Defense Secretaries Gates and Rumsfeld, Michael Waltz is here this morning.</p><p>Texas congressman and member of the House Appropriations Committee, Henry Cuellar, joining me, along with Texas congressman and House Financial Services Committee member, Roger Williams. Former ICE Director, Tom Homan, stopping by, along with professional golfer, Bryson DeChambeau, joining us. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big couple of hours coming up.</p><p>I want to kick this hour off with big tech and your data, a bipartisan effort from two senators looking to crack down on companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, to force them to reveal the value of their user data. Senator Mark Warner talked about it to Axios, on HBO. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): Clearly, I don't think we'll end up being the long-term status quo case, is that all of this personal information that is being sucked out of us, often times, unknowingly, as we use our phones and devices on a regular basis. That that is not something that is entirely owned by the platform company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: On the House side, Congressman Kevin McCarthy pushing this through as well, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning, welcome back.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And, you know, I mean, Kevin McCarthy will say, look, we ought to know, as the public, what data is being sold and what data is being used for what purposes, and I think it's true.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One of the things that's interesting with what they're talking about in the Axios piece is the value of the data, and I think that's very esoteric concept. I think we should step back and be very clear and transparent about what data is out there and who is using it and how is it used.</p><p>I think putting financial disclosure is in about the value of the data, is just going to further confuse the process, I think the consumer wants to know what their data is and who has it.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There are so many issues for big tech right now in Washington. It's not -- it's not just this privacy issue of how your data is being used but it's also the idea that these companies have so much power, monopolistic power that needs to be reined in.</p><p>And then there's also the issue of fairness, are they unfairly, you know -- are they treating conservatives unfairly in forums like Facebook and whatnot, so the big-tech's problems are going to be a big focus in Washington for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why Devin Nunes, who joined me yesterday, Congressman Nunes is suing Twitter and McClatchy, he's got a court date for Twitter in August for this very reason, because he has been treated differently on Twitter he says, than for example, AOC.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the President makes that claim as well. But what I think is really interesting is the consumer aspect of this, when all these platforms originated, they weren't big business, and now they are.</p><p>Consumers are also wizening up to the fact their data is being harvested, and they're going to turn away. I know so many people who have said I'm not using Facebook anymore. I've taken the app off my phone because they're worried about it.</p><p>So, as, you know, business is catering to consumers, that's one concern as well as the regulation side of it as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How easy is it to take it off your phone? For a little while, we were talking about this and you couldn't delete if you tried.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But you can't delete your account, but I know so many people, and I am guilty as is somebody to my right. That we are not using Facebook, but we are using Instagram, right?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes. Well, they're all and WhatsApp. They're all together.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We are following our children, right, because they abandoned Facebook a long time ago and are all over Instagram.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And Snapchat and WhatsApp, exactly.</p><p>DEANGELIS: I'll tell you something, I did a little experiment, I turned the microphones off on these platforms and looked to see how the advertising, the targeted advertising actually changed, and I found that the ads were less targeted to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>DEANGELIS: I'm not saying there is a connection there, but it definitely was something that made me think twice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is really scary that they are listening to you so closely and then targeting ads at you just from the microphone. Whoa.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I have a case study, I walked into my house last week, I said to my wife, our Polaris, that's the thing that cleans the bottom of the pool, is broken, because the wheel came off and there was an ad in my phone the following morning for Polaris.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And all you did was say the word --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I said the word, Polaris. It could've been anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you have echo or anything in --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: No, I don't have. I don't have any of those chat box, and so it just had to be my phone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it was your phone?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible, actually. A senior Facebook executive told the BBC that the company favors government regulation when it comes to offensive content. So they are basically saying, look, we welcome it, bring it on, they have to say that at this point. At this point, they are up against the corner. They know regulation is coming.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, right. And now, the only effort is to manage how tough it's going to be, how deep it's going to be.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But history has proven that if your industry is going to be regulated, there's two ways to deal with it, you can ignore it and fight it and resist, or you can get ahead of it and then try to craft what the regulation is, and that's what they're doing. It's a smart strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This Devin Nunes lawsuit is interesting because if he wins, then it could mean that these companies are regulated differently, in fact, they are looked at as media companies because part of Devin Nunes' lawsuit is that Twitter is a content publisher.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes, and absolutely, I mean, you think about it every day as soon as you go to publish something there. You're putting it out there. You have a platform to do that and I think, you know, people are thinking twice about it, but the question that I would have is how can they regulate it? There's so much content, what can they actually really do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, these companies say, no, we're not media companies, we are an internet company. We are just giving you the forum to talk back and forth. But, in fact, there is a lot of content --</p><p>HILSENRATH: But do they want to embrace the idea that they are media companies and use the first amendment to their -- to bring it to their own defense, I'm not sure how that strategy fits into what they are thinking about. But, you know, they could argue that they shouldn't be regulated because they are media companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. We'll take a short break. When we come back, FedEx is under pressure this morning, the shipping giant slashing prices to keep up with the competition. Then, no case of the Mondays here, we're taking a look at how to keep employees happy, in this new era of work, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures indicating a higher opening this morning for stock prices, despite rising tensions with Iran, joining me right now, Optimal Capital Director of Strategy and Market Analyst, Frances Newton Stacy, Frances, it is good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Hey, great to see you, Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, interesting that you've got all of this unrest, whether it is the uncertainty about China or the unrest having to do with Iran and one of the most important stories for these markets right here, cover story of the Journal, bond yields plunging, signaling unease this morning.</p><p>And last week, we saw the 10-year drop below 2 percent, what do you think yields are telling us, Frances?</p><p>STACY: Well, I think the yields are telling us that the truth about decelerating growth, decelerating inflation in the economy is definitely slowing down. But what's so fascinating, as you say, is that it's not being priced into the indices.</p><p>And just that tells me that volatility coming up against, you know, all- time highs, taking up all-time highs, and volatility being so low, is actually suppressed by the expectation, number one, for a China deal to wiggle its way through and also the expectation for the Fed to cut rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it's all that uncertainty, Jon, typically when you see yields this low, it indicates, perhaps, a recession is on the horizon. Does it always indicate that, though?</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, what we've got is something called an inverted yield curve where long term interest rates are lower than short term interest rates. And basically, what -- that the market thinks the Fed is going to have to cut short-term interest rates because they are too high, the Fed tends to cut short term interest rates when we're heading towards a recession to get the economy going.</p><p>So, it is a troublesome sign. And I think it's one of the reasons why we've seen the Fed shift its stance dramatically in the last few months. They are now talking about a cut -- the market is pricing in a high probability of a cut at the next meeting in July.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And which is why the Federal Reserve was such in focus last week. The Fed, last week, decided to hold rates steady, even though the President has called for a rate cut, the President denied that he actually threatened to demote Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell.</p><p>He never actually said that. He was answering a question from a reporter. Here's what the President said about all of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, CURRENT MODERATOR, NBC'S MEET THE PRESS: Do you threat to demote him? Do you think that's had an impact?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't ever threaten to demote him.</p><p>TODD: There have been some talks that you might demote him to the number two slot.</p><p>TRUMP: I'd be able to do that if I wanted, but I haven't suggested that.</p><p>TODD: That's not a threat --</p><p>TRUMP: No, it's not.</p><p>TODD: -- that's just a reminder that you can?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no. I have the right to do that, but I haven't said that. What he has done is 50 billion a month in quantitative tightening, that's ridiculous. What he's done is he raised interest rates too fast.</p><p>TODD: Are you worried it's going to hurt --</p><p>TRUMP: I've been proven right.</p><p>TODD: -- your re-election?</p><p>TRUMP: I think the economy is so strong. We're going to bull through it. But I'm not happy with his actions. No, I don't think he's done a good job. I think this, if he didn't raise rates, Obama had very low rates, so Obama was playing with funny money. I wasn't. I'm playing with the real stuff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Frances, your reaction to what the President has said about Jay Powell?</p><p>STACY: Well, I think it's very interesting. I think he thought he'd tightened too much too quickly, and I actually agree with that assessment as we saw the markets selloff in December. The thing that the Fed is really contending with is that we only have 2-1/2 percent or 250 basis points to lower rates should we have problem with the economy.</p><p>So, they have every incentive to try and get those rates up. But I agree with your other guest, they can't really do it. You know, the inverted yield curve, they're going to have to go ahead and cut rates. Although, I do not think that we're going to see a rate cut in July, unless they stop producing the balance sheet, reducing the balance sheets, putting the brakes on, rate cuts are stepping on the gas.</p><p>And I don't think they're going to do this two things simultaneously because they're not going to negate their own tools with only 250 basis points to play with, so I think we'll see a rate cut in September.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a good point. You don't want to see the executive office, bullying the Federal Reserve, I get that. But you have to also look at what Jay Powell has done here, because we were talking about three-rate hikes just six months ago and the unwinding of the balance sheet. Obviously, he was misguided.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, the Fed misread where the economy was going. They expected a slowdown, what they didn't expect was an inflation was going to stay so slow, and that the global economy was going to slowdown.</p><p>I just want to raise one point, in that clip, the President said he's got a right to demote the Federal Reserve chairman, that's not at all clear in the law, and Jay Powell has said that if the President asked him to leave his job, he won't do it, so if the President amps this up, this could be the kind of thing that ends up in court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I was uncomfortable with reporting last week, that the President said he wanted to demote him in the first place, because he really never said that. He was answering a reporter's question. The reporter said, do you want to demote him? He goes, we'll see how he does or we'll see what happens, which is what he says to a lot of things.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One thing that's interesting is this Fed has been incredibly transparent, right? And there are three Fed governors/president speaking this week, including Powell, a matter of fact, tomorrow, so it'd be interesting in the wake of all of this and more economic news and $13 trillion worth of global debt with negative yields, what they have to say about this.</p><p>And the FOMC themselves are very divided about raising versus lowering, so it'd be interesting to see about the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a lot of (INAUDIBLE) to read, actually. Frances, before you go, real quick, we've got the GDP number out this week, your thoughts on what we are going to hear from all these economic data in the next couple of days, consumer confidence out tomorrow, GDP out on Thursday before the G20 meeting on Friday.</p><p>STACY: Yes. I think it's just going to continue to show that growth is decelerating, which I think is going to give Trump more impetus to put pressure on the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Great to talk with you, Frances, thanks.</p><p>STACY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Frances Newton Stacy joining us there.

What employers can do to empower their workforce? All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But our top story this half an hour, the border crisis.</p><p>President Trump announcing plans to delay the deportations of millions of illegal immigrants in order to have more time to work with Congress. On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", I spoke with House Intel Committee ranking member Devin Nunes about the wait.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to the president's move to wait two weeks to see if the Democrats actually approach this issue?</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (D-CA): I think what he's doing is the Democrats asked him if he would delay this? He said, \"OK, I'll give you two weeks.\" Now, remember the Democrats have been in office for six months now, they have yet to move a comprehensive immigration bill. And I think that's what the American people need to focus on is the people that they elect have responsibilities to pass legislation.</p><p>They can't just oppose what the president wants to do because as you know, you've been at the border, you know that it's a -- it's a disaster down there. It is a humanitarian crisis. And this is a problem that could easily be fixed if we wanted to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, Tom Homan. Tom, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting any action on these issues? We know that because of the Flores agreement, because of the asylum standards, we have all of these people crossing the border. We're talking about a million people expected, a million this year. HOMAN: No, I'm not optimistic. I think the president's smart to give him -- you know, giving opportunity to come to the table and present something that's -- you know, that's appropriate. But look, as Nunes just said, look, they've had this issue for a year and a half. Meaning that the Congress where they haven't closed the loopholes that caused this crisis to begin with.</p><p>Women -- 31 percent of women being raped. Children are dying. That wasn't enough to make them move. What was the final stroke that broke the cameras back? ISIS going to go and rest illegal aliens who've been ordering moved by a judge. That is what the Democrats brought -- that's what brought them to the table. Not the other stuff.</p><p>This, again, I think it's very telling they're more interest in protecting illegal aliens who've been ordering moved by a judge. They're more interest in protecting them than securing this border. And this latest offered by Nancy Pelosi proves it.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Tom, the president has used unconventional tactics to work on this issue. But offering this two weeks to the Democrats. Do you think that they'll take that opportunity and try to move the ball forward?</p><p>HOMAN: I think they'll put something on the table but it won't be anything meaningful. I mean, do I think they're going to change the asylum laws were 90 percent of the claimants are creating fraud? No.</p><p>Do I think they'll going to allow us to detain families long enough to see a judge? No. Do I think they're going to treat children of Central America the same way you treat children from Mexico, once it's determined you're not a victim of trafficking, you can be returned? No. I think they're going to throw money at the humanitarian crisis, which is -- which is a good point, but they're going to do nothing to secure this border in a meaningful way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, why not? I mean, Tom, why not? We're looking at these pictures of the children that I encountered when I went to the border about a month and a half ago now. It was incredible. First of all, they were all sick. They had been walking, hitchhiking for months. They needed to go to the hospital many of them.</p><p>These two over there, they were sisters, they're holding each other's hands. One was six, one was eight. They said that their mother -- they were with their mother but their mother said she was going to get something to eat and then left. And -- you know, she -- they haven't seen their mother.</p><p>I mean, I don't know how true that is, I don't know what the story is, but there's obviously a renting of children program going on in Guatemala, which we've heard about. How much are mothers getting for their kids for that just smugglers could take the kids over the border and then send them back, and then do it again?</p><p>HOMAN: What is -- it is happening. There's intelligent enforce -- there's criminal investigations being conducted by ICE. It goes from a several hundred -- several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.</p><p>But your question why won't they fix this? That's a good question. I mean, again, children are dying, women are being raped. They -- you see the images on the southern border. You got Democrats calling these concentration camps, but they haven't offered up one fix for the crisis.</p><p>They have -- they haven't offered one idea. The president actually put an immigration plan on the table. They're not even talking about it. So, you know, this is politics. They want this president to fail on his border security promise. This is about the election, this is about power, this is about resisting this president.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Hey, Tom. Good morning, Michele Roschelle. In the list of things that you articulated before from pathway to citizenship, DACA, chain migration, and so forth. Is there anyone element where there could be sort of a kernel of bipartisanship to build on? Or is this just becomes so tribal and not wanting to give the president to win on it for any reason that we're just not going to make any progress in these two weeks?</p><p>HOMAN: I don't see any bipartisanship. I see one thing. I think both sides care about the health and safety of women and children. I think the border (INAUDIBLE) are doing the best job they can. They don't want these children be sick, they don't want these women to be raped.</p><p>So, I think what they can agree all on that, that there is a humanitarian crisis. But what they don't agree on is this a humanitarian crisis has caused a national security crisis. Border Patrols already said, 46 percent of (INAUDIBLE) are not working like taking care of the vulnerable populations, which means that cartels are moving drugs and bad people to unprotected parts of the border.</p><p>So, I got -- I got -- I'm not optimistic about this at all, but I agree, the president given an opportunity. From once again he can say, I gave you an opportunity, you could -- the three things I just mentioned, TVPRA, asylum, and the -- and the Flores settlement. That can be fixed in one day. They don't need two weeks.</p><p>So, let's see if they're serious about -- you know, protecting these women, protecting the children, and stop -- and stop enticing them to come to this countries by closing the loophole.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, so wait, you were the head of ICE. You say this can be fixed within a couple of weeks.</p><p>HOMAN: Absolutely. If they came to the table and fix asylum laws to make it make sense, so, you -- it's not 90 percent fraud. If they just change - - if the families want to come and claim asylum, fine.</p><p>Let us detain them long enough to see a judge. Back in 2015, I did that. And we kept about 40-45 days, and guess what, 90 percent loss of cases. We fill planes full of families the send himself, and the border numbers went down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOMAN: It wasn't until the Flores and some of agreement said, well, I'm not going to let you hold them long enough to see a judge, we're going to release him after 20 days. That's where -- that's where the surge started.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Tom, how does the rise of sanctuary cities affect ISIS ability to enforce these deportation cases and the whole strategy of dealing with these cases?</p><p>HOMAN: It makes it very difficult. First of all, sanctuary cities is another enticement where people, you know, the bankroll criminal cartels against the United States, will then get into sanctuary city where they think they'd be protective mice.</p><p>Even they get arrested in county jail. That's another enticement that brings these people to this country. But it's hard. When local law enforcement who want to do the right thing, they want to work well in law enforcement, but the -- either the mayor or the -- or the governor has passed legislation, said you're not going to do it.</p><p>So, it makes it hard to be -- it makes -- it makes ICE see job harder. They could arrest these people into county jail. That to get arrested rather than going to the neighborhoods, and putting himself at risk, put the immigrant community at risk. Because when you go out to the community rest the bad guy, chance are you going to find others, others that weren't even on our radar.</p><p>So, sanctuary cities are dangerous for immigrant communities and it's dangerous for men and women advice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom, you make a lot of important points. Thanks so much.</p><p>HOMAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Homan joining us there. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart is turning to artificial intelligence at the checkout line. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Probably, that this was coming, Maria. The retailer is installing A.I. powered cameras of more than 1,000 stores. They say that the cameras are going to help identify checkout scanning errors, and also failures. The system notifies checkout attendants when a theft issue arises. Which shares a Wal-Mart up about 20 percent, so far, of this year.</p><p>Well, FedEx reportedly slashing prices in the face of rising competition to fill its planes. The Wall Street Journal says that the company is offering discounts to some of its express network customers.</p><p>This comes as FedEx is trying to take business away from UPS. FedEx ending a shipping contract with Amazon later this month. That's already been announced. The company reports earnings after the closing bell tomorrow. There is the year to date chart of FedEx.</p><p>Slurpees on the beach. Yes, (INAUDIBLE). My blast story. Convenient store 7-Eleven becoming more convenient. The chain is expanding its delivery service to public places.</p><p>The customers can now order a Slurpee, have it delivered to more than 2,000, 7-Eleven hot spots, including Central Park, obviously. Venice Beach in Los Angeles, all to starts today. Customers need to download the 7NOW app to get the service.</p><p>My biggest question, will my Slurpees still be icy cold on the beach, but we shall see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, yes, that is a good point, after the whole delivery, yes.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For, at least, we now know that we could feed our Slurpee -- want to download,</p><p>DEANGELIS: And it's another app. They'll track your location, they'll know exactly what you're doing in, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Shut the microphone.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Can we get them delivered right here after a couple more cups of coffee?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, maybe, we'll have sure there's a hotspot.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Cheryl, can we get -- yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: By the way, the FedEx story is really interesting to me. You know, it's another sign that there's just no inflation in this economy. When -- you know, we talk about the economy growing fast and unemployment so low, everyone is expecting prices to start rising, and FedEx is out there cutting them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point. It's a great point.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And to tie the story, and the more negative yields around the world, the stronger our (INAUDIBLE) gets, and the less inflation we have.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So, all time together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Yes, all right, coming up, CBD crackdown. One city ready to take cannabis products off a store shelves in just days. The threat to business, coming up.</p><p>And then, work hard, work happy. How you can start off your week with a bang and your boss can help? Back in a minute with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Hawaii Star Advertiser reporting this morning, NTSB opens probe into Dillingham Air Field plane crash, 11 people killed in that crash. The National Transportation Safety Board says it would be looking at evidence like log books, weather conditions, runway conditions and the plane's maintenance record to figure out why the plane went down.</p><p>The San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports BET Awards honor Mary J. Blige, Nipsy Hussle, and Tyler Perry -- the 2019 awards features a number of pop and rap stars dominating the charts but the show belonged to artists viewed as icons, including singer Mary J. Blige; filmmaker, Tyler Perry; and late rapper, Nipsy Hussle.</p><p>And the New York Post this morning reporting that New York City is banning CBD stores. CBD has stores (INAUDIBLE) options; the clock is now ticking for retailers that sell goods infused with CBD. A New York City Health Department ban is slate to go into effect, July 1, those not obeying this new rule will start getting fined in the fall. Business is now weighing other options.</p><p>These are some of the stories across the country. Of course, we've got a major week this week not just economy data but also the G-20, where the president will meet with President Xi -- any expectations in terms of what takes place here, Jackie?</p><p>DEANGELIS: I think that he's going to have a constructive conversation to set the stage for something to happen, but I think anybody who thinks something's going to happen this week per se, might be getting a little ahead of what's actually, you know, happening --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because these are important issues that they reneged on, like the theft of intellectual property, they don't want to make that a law, that's against the law to steal the intellectual property from the west.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They don't have enough time to get talks going again to be able to come to a deal, so I don't think anyone should have expectations that they're going to have a deal coming out of this meeting. I mean, what it looks like is going to happen is an agreement to start talking again and maybe something happens down the road.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But that's progress, because right now the talks are stalled altogether. So, the two of them can get the train back on tracks. I think that the market will perceive that as good news.</p><p>HILSENRATH: If they can get it back on track. But then, you have to wonder if they don't get it resolved say, six months down the road, does the president say, that's 300 billion tariffs on another on another 300 --</p><p>DEANGELIS: He just might. He just might. I think that's why he's holding onto that card, to play it potentially down the road. But overall, I think the market thinks end of the summer, that could be, you know, good timing.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, the other variable is that after end of summer, we're moving into an -- really moving into an election cycle and how does that play into the president's calculations on tariffs and how they affect the economy and all this other stuff.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One thing that's interesting is there bite for being tough on China. So, it's an interesting card for the president to play as he's going up against a handful of Democrat opponents to show himself as being tough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No one has done it before this.</p><p>HILSENRATH: On the one hand, there's support for being tough on China. On the other, we have global economy that's slowing that looks like it's affecting the U.S. economy, and China is at the center of that global slowdown. So, you know, he wants a strong economy going into this election year, so it's a tough call.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but a strong economy is also strong national security, right? And this is a national security issue. Mike Pompeo -- Mike Pence, the president, have been trying to communicate to the public that this has (INAUDIBLE). Let's face it. China had been pumping out submarines, they've been building up their military, they want to overtake the U.S. as largest military. Somebody said to me this weekend, the U.S. has duty to stop China from doing -- from becoming the largest military power. A duty, because who wants a communist country dominating the world? That's what this is about.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And the think about for generations, all of our wars were about stopping communism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break, when we come -- yes?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I was just -- this is a different kind of communist country than the Soviet Union. China is very much engaged in the global economy in ways that it wasn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you -- you want China -- you're not uncomfortable with the Chinese having the largest military and the most dominant military in the world.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That was the next point I was going to make, you know, is that good for us or bad for us, that's the part I can't say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will take a break. When we come back, optimizing employee happiness; how to start workweek off right with the help of your boss. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The case of the Mondays, headed back to work after the weekend can be rough if not sad. Happiness at the office is something more employees want and more employers are looking to give them in order to keep them for the long haul. Joining us right now is the CEO and Founder of Brightfox, Deena Fox. Deena, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DEENA FOX, CEO AND FOUNDER, BRIGHTFOX: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us what the goal is and how to achieve happiness for employees?</p><p>FOX: Yes, I think happiness is the result of employers creating a great employee experience. And I think that something that employers and employees need to keep in mind is that the employment relationship is like any other relationship in our lives and it requires engagement from both sides.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see that throughout corporate America? When you worked in human resources departments at Amazon, you've worked at Jet.com, Hugo Boss, Oscar Health, tell us about your experiences and what you've taken away from the companies working there in H.R.</p><p>FOX: Yes. I mean, these are companies in different industries, different stages of growth, different sizes -- anywhere from 90 people to, you know, hundreds of thousands of people. And I think that over last nearly two decades I found that people generally want three things, to find meaning and purpose at work. One they have to find that the work that they're doing is meaningful, that they actually enjoy it, that they leverage the skill set that they have today to contribute to their role. They have to have opportunities to learn and grow. And, third, they have to feel a sense of community and belonging at work and I think in each of those areas, the employer has to focus on the employment experience and really ensure that people feel that they can optimize their performance in a way of sense of accomplishment for them.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Deena, what's the biggest mistake that managers make in managing their workers? What do you see people doing over and over again that they need to change?</p><p>FOX: I think it starts with not setting clear expectations up front and then when things sort of start to fester --</p><p>DEANGELIS: Avoiding conflict?</p><p>FOX: Right, avoiding conflict. And I think that, you know, your question about managers is really on point in terms of that correlation between workplace, happiness and satisfaction, because managers are the single biggest variable in the experience that people have in the company. And so, I think really, companies have to think about how to take that variability and streamline the experience. And, of course, I think, you do in great part through leveraging technology like we do in so many parts of our lives.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One of the things we mentioned here -- and you've said about (INAUDIBLE) workplace, and how much of this -- real quickly -- how much of this is physical, like the workspace as opposed to intangible in terms of experience?</p><p>FOX: That's also a great question. So, employee experience is a term that employers and H.R. leaders use pretty regularly now, but it's sort of staying at this really superficial level and it is a combination of all three of those things. So, it's a thoughtfully curated program that incorporates the physical work space, the perks and benefits of the company, the core H.R. processes as well as that whole sense of community and belonging.</p><p>DEANGELIS: You know, I wonder how you could advise employees to communicate better with managers.</p><p>FOX: I think that it goes back to my earlier point that they have to understand that they have a responsibility to engage, sometimes I think people in the workplace, they tend to keep things inside or my manager --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We take it for granted.</p><p>FOX: My manager didn't ask me for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deena, it's great to get your insight.</p><p>FOX: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deena Fox. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019062401cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-KC51-JB20-G0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp;

Finally, it is here, 2020. We've been talking about it for months, the election year that seemed like it might never come finally beginning. And it started with a bang literally, the assassination of an Iranian general and a new release of unredacted e- mails that suggest the order to keep the freeze on Ukrainian aid came directly from the president. If history is any guide, that will be just the start of an election cycle that no one can predict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Think about it. Who could have anticipated that in 1960, Richard Nixon's debate performance would be remembered more for his lack of makeup than his prose or that in 1967, George Romney would see his candidacy implode after saying that he was, quote, \"brainwashed\" while in Vietnam? That Edmund Muskie would either cry or get snow in his eye in New Hampshire in 1972? That in 1976 in a debate against Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford would say, quote, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe?\"</p><p>That in 1987 when Gary Hart told the media that if they followed him, they'd be bored, they would and they weren't? That in 1992, Ross Perot would drop out of the race after saying that the Bush campaign was plotting to disrupt his daughter's wedding? That the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush would come down to something called hanging chads?</p><p>That in 2004, worse than Howard Dean's third-place finish in the Iowa caucus, would be the scream with which he ended his concession speech? That in 2011, Rick Perry would say that if elected, he'd eliminate three government agencies and then not be able to name them?</p><p>Or that in 2016, this trifecta would play out? First that Donald Trump would be outed with an old \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which he made crude remarks years prior, second that \"WikiLeaks\" would release 2,050 Clinton campaign e-mails an hour later, third that two days thereafter Donald Trump would invite the media to watch his debate prep, only to have him surprise everyone by presenting three women who each claimed sexual harassment against Bill Clinton.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, here is the one certainty, the only thing we know for sure about the 2020 election, that we really don't know what's about to happen unless you're this guy. Now to Iran. Both Iran's president and the supreme leader have vowed revenge for the killing of General Qasem Soleimani. The U.S. is deploying thousands of additional troops to the region and cities across the country are remaining vigilant and monitoring the events overseas, which leads me to this week's survey question. I want to know what you think. Go to my website at Smerconish.com and answer this. Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani?</p><p>Joining me now is CNN's National Security Analyst, Peter Bergen. He just wrote this piece for CNN.com, \"The killing of Iran's General Soleimani is hugely significant.\" He's also the author of the book, \"Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\"</p><p>Peter, the president said that Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks, but he wouldn't say what exactly they were. What's known, if anything, in that regard?</p><p>PETER BERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST; AUTHOR, \"TRUMP AND HIS GENERALS\": Well, I think the use of the word imminent is partly a legal effort to make sure that this killing was legally authorized. I mean, White House lawyers and State Department lawyers and others have weighed in to say that this was legal and imminence is one of the kind of -- go back, for instance, to Anwar al-Awlaki, the American citizen who was killed by a drone during the Obama administration.</p><p>He was a -- he was an American citizen. One of the rationales that the White House offered at the time was imminence. So this is, I think, kind of a crucial word. Now, what caused that word to be used in terms of what was the actual intelligence, we just don't know because the administration hasn't really provided it. (ph)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Interesting that you reference the the law that would apply here because I was thinking about international law and how anticipatory self-defense is appropriate, but we think of it in a context of use against an invading force and not against a leader. Isn't that what makes this case rather unique?</p><p>BERGEN: Yes. I think -- I mean, you know, Max Boot, our CNN colleague, pointed out on Friday that this is the first time that the United States has killed the senior military leader since 1943 when the United States took down the Japanese plane carrying the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack.</p><p>So you know, that is pretty unusual, but, you know, we know from history that administration lawyers can often find a legal rationale for what the administration is about to do whether that's waterboarding in the post 9/11 era or killing an American citizen during the Obama administration or now this.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK. So let's talk about a political rationale. I want to put up on the screen a very interesting tweet yesterday. It was Vice President Mike Pence who sent this out. It was part of a continuum of tweets and he was explaining the rationale for taking out Qasem Soleimani. [09:05:04] Look what he said, Peter. \"Assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.\" When I saw that, I thought shades of the Iraq misdirection. What do -- what do you think?</p><p>BERGEN: Well, pretty much everything in that tweet is not correct and if that was a standard, you know, the United States would somehow have been assisting the hijackers because they all received visas to the United States and then many of them overstayed those visas. I mean, so the fact is Iran -- Al-Qaeda folks have transitioned to Iran in the pre 9/11 era and certainly Al-Qaeda leaders have lived in Iran under some form of house arrest for many years after 9/11, but this is a very different statement than sort of saying that somehow Iran was complicit in the 9/11 attacks, which the 9/11 Commission completely dismissed.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Right. By the way, I want to put on the screen my response. I retweeted Vice President Pence. Here's what I said. I said, \"Ten of 12? You're missing seven and why aren't you talking about the 15 of 19 who were Saudis? And let's just continue your thought. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Iran knowingly assisted any part of the plot of September 11.</p><p>BERGEN: Yes. And, you know, the reason that we had 15 out of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, it's very easy for Saudi citizens as a general proposition to get visas to the United States and, you know, there were no Iranians involved in the attack and, you know, there were no Iranians in Al-Qaeda itself. So look, I mean, this is a kind of crazy conspiracy theory that for some reason the vice president is pushing or somebody who is managing his tweeting account.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Peter, I want to flip the other side of the aisle and look at the Democratic response. On the screen, here comes vice president -- former vice president Biden's response in part. He said this, \"No American will mourn Qasem Soleimani's passing. He deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region. He supported terror and sowed chaos. None of that negates the fact that this is a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region.\"</p><p>Can you have it both ways? I noted that Elizabeth Warren also said this guy had blood on his hands, American blood on his hands. Can you say both, well, he deserved to be taken out, but not in this fashion?</p><p>BERGEN: You know, I mean, look, history will tell whether this was a bold move that, you know, took out a real enemy of the United States or a really reckless move that kind of amped up the problems in the region in such a way that, you know, is detrimental to the safety of Americans. If indeed we are more safe, if Americans are safer, why is it that, you know, the State Department's urging Americans to leave Iraq?</p><p>Anyway, look, I -- you know, the thing is very politicized and the fact is is that killing SoleimaniI think, you know, was a good thing for the United States. Will it ramp up pressures in the region? Of course it will. Is this a calculated risk that may blow up? Maybe. Is this a calculated risk that may pay off? Maybe. We don't know yet.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I think that's fair. Thank you, Peter Bergen. I appreciate your thoughts.</p><p>BERGEN: Thank you, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Make sure you're tweeting me @Smerconish or going to my Facebook page. I'll read some responses throughout the course of the program. This comes from Facebook I think. What do we have? \"Unless you or I are cleared with the highest security clearance, we do not have to know the specifics. We only have to trust that decision resulting in the ending of the life of a killer of Americans.\"</p><p>Ed, I'm thrilled that the guy's gone, but I think it's entirely appropriate to be demanding of this administration -- in fact, I'll say especially this administration given its record of untruthfulness on a lot of national security matters to know specifically what exactly was being planned that you have knowledge of. How could that corrupt or in some way diminish national security interests for us to know? I want to know the answer to that.</p><p>One more if we have time. Here it is. \"Isn't it ironic how now we have the greatest intelligence community in the world according to Trump. For three years, he's done everything he could to discredit it?\" Charles, I had a radio caller or two point that out yesterday that, as you have been saying, he was hammering the intel industry since he -- intelligence community since he came into office and now is very reliant on them and saying that he had no choice, but to act at that time.</p><p>Make sure that you're tweeting me and I will continue to read responses and answer today's survey question at Smerconish.com. Can we put that back on the screen? Here it comes. Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani? Vote and I will give you results at the end of the program.</p><p>Coming up, was President Trump justified? We'll find out. And also as Nancy Pelosi continues to withhold articles of impeachment awaiting details on the Senate procedure, who holds the upper hand as between Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell?</p><p>[09:10:08]</p><p>And this Monday, the sexual assault trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein begins with some of his 80 accusers saying they'll show up in the courtroom. What is his defense and will he take the stand? I'll ask his lead attorney who famously said if you don't want to be a victim, don't go to the hotel room.</p><p>Plus, is a crime even more criminal because the perpetrator did so out of hate of a particular group or does that tread too close to prosecuting thought crime?</p><p>SMERCONISH: The New Year begins with an impeached American president, but no Senate trial date. Yesterday's exchange between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi left us no closer to resolution of when a Senate trial will begin and what its rules might be.</p><p>My own view is that McConnell is running out the clock, content to have the entire process delayed until Americans are casting ballots in the 2020 election, strengthening the White House argument that this dispute should be settled at the ballot box. The holidays interrupted any momentum Democrats might have enjoyed for impeachment and now with the threat of war with Iran escalating, it's difficult to see how they'll get their mojo back.</p><p>Joining me now to discuss is \"Washington Post\" columnist Karen Tumulty who wrote this piece, \"Democrats are the ones who stand to suffer by delaying the Senate impeachment trial.\" Karen, let me give the audience a little taste of what you wrote. Here's a paragraph from your essay.</p><p>We have reached the point at which Democrats are going to have to make a choice. Do they want to squander precious days and weeks tilted against an impregnable Republican wall in the Senate or do they want to make their strongest case for removing Trump to office to the people who might actually do it -- the voters?</p><p>Can they walk and chew gum at the same time? Can they pursue both paths successfully?</p><p>KAREN TUMULTY, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, it's becoming more and more difficult thanks to the calendar and I've covered Nancy Pelosi a long time. I think that, you know, when the House gets back to business next week, we're going to see her transmit those articles within a matter of days because her instincts are really sound on these things and the Democrats will continue and should continue to point out that the process in the Senate is not exactly a fair trial. But at this point, we are less than four weeks away from the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>The next big debate on the 14th, three of the five people who have qualified for the stage may find themselves sitting in the Senate chamber silently, leaving, you know, an entire debate stage just right before the caucuses to Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden. So things are going to pick up very, very quickly. By mid-March, we probably are going to know who the nominee is.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I note your use of the word silently. They'll be silently in the Senate as this plays itself out, but is it, politically speaking, necessarily a bad thing for Elizabeth Warren, for Bernie Sanders, for Cory Booker, for Michael Bennet -- I feel like I'm missing somebody from the -- from the list -- Amy Klobuchar, no disrespect -- I mean, they will be front and center. I recognize that Mayor Pete and Joe Biden could be back in Iowa and have the stage to themselves there, but I'm not sure of the political calculation.</p><p>TUMULTY: Well, the thing -- right now, the Democratic race is extremely fluid. I mean, all you have to do is look at Bernie Sanders' rise over the past two or three weeks and when you go out on the trail, and the candidates will tell you, people don't ask them that much about impeachment. They ask them much more about their views on issues that are actually going to affect their lives in the long term and I think with what is going on with Iran, you're also going to see a lot of voters suddenly having questions that they didn't have on national security.</p><p>So again, we are at a very, very fluid moment at this -- at this moment in the race. A lot of people haven't made up their minds, not only in Iowa, but in the big states that are going to be following very shortly after. The voters have a lot of questions that they want these candidates to be out there answering.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Well, did Nancy Pelosi misjudge the situation by thinking she had leverage over Mitch McConnell that really doesn't exist? Meaning, should she have transmitted those articles of impeachment before the holidays?</p><p>TUMULTY: She saw that Congress was going on a break and there was probably no great downside for a short delay while nobody was in town anyway, but again, I think that things are beginning to change. I also think, by the way, that the dynamic here could begin to change for her vulnerable freshmen who are also very much -- you know, their survival is very much on the line here.</p><p>It's not that Democrats shouldn't point out that Mitch McConnell has essentially rigged the trial, but they also need to move on and start making their case on other issues which, you know, voters who don't spend all their time on Twitter are more concerned with.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK. So here's something else that you wrote in your column, \"The impeachment imperative now, both on practical and substantive grounds, is for Democrats to move on. They are the ones who stand to suffer by delaying the inevitable.\" What exactly does that mean? Does it mean anything more than transmit the articles of impeachment?</p><p>TUMULTY: No. It means continue to bring forward new information, although there is really no evidence that that is swaying public opinion at all. Public opinion surged in favor of impeachment, it had been against it and is now pretty much evenly divided, but it's been essentially frozen since October. But they should continue to develop new information, they should continue to point out that the trial in the Senate is not -- that the administration hasn't provided the witnesses it should have, but they also need to get on to other issues.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Quick final question. At one time, I thought that censure was an option that both parties could agree on and move on. Has that ship sailed?</p><p>TUMULTY: Yes. I also thought censure was an option back when we were talking about the Mueller report, but I think that the president's actions with respect to Ukraine really changed that entirely.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Karen Tumulty, thank you so much. We appreciate your being here.</p><p>TUMULTY: Thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What's going on in social media? This comes, I think, from Facebook. What do we have? \"Please stop enabling Trump this year.\" OK. I'm enabling Trump by having a conversation as to how the impeachment process is going to play itself out? That's not making any sense.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, upcoming, I want to remind you to answer the survey question at Smerconish.com. Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani? Make sure you're voting.</p><p>Up ahead, Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault trial begins Monday. His lead attorney is female. Does that make it easier or more difficult to cross-examine his accusers? I'll ask her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONNA ROTUNNO, HARVEY WEINSTEIN LEAD ATTORNEY: If you don't want to be a victim, don't go to the hotel room and if you don't want to be a victim, don't sign an NDA. Then go out onto Fifth Avenue, take a megaphone and talk about what you want to talk about.</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>SMERCONISH: On Monday, the trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein begins in New York. When the story of his sexual misconduct broke in 2017, it ignited the #MeToo movement. Some of Weinstein's more than 80 accusers plan to attend, but only two of their claims are at issue in this criminal case. Weinstein has denied all charges and has countered by claiming to have been a champion of women in film. I spoke earlier with Weinstein's lead attorney, Donna Rotunno.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey, counsel, tell me if I'm correct. This seems like one of these cases where, at the end, you, the defense lawyer, are facing the jury and saying, hey, I don't like my client either, but that's not what this case is about.</p><p>ROTUNNO: Well, I don't know if that's true. I mean, I actually get along with Harvey quite well. I think for me, this is about talking to a jury about the fact that you don't have to like everything he's ever done in his life to find that he's not a rapist.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You've said that he might be a sinner, but not a rapist. What's the sin that he'll admit to?</p><p>ROTUNNO: Well, he cheated on his wife, he made very bad decisions in business in terms of how he treated people and he'd be the first one to admit those things were were not nice.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is the defense in each of these instances one of consensual sex?</p><p>ROTUNNO: Yes. Consensual sex and a ...</p><p>SMERCONISH: Don't you require ...</p><p>ROTUNNO: ... and a history of a -- of a relationship, a history of a relationship.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Don't you require his testimony in order to make that defense effectively?</p><p>ROTUNNO: I don't think you do and it's possible that he may take the stand depending on how the evidence plays out, but in this case, we have a lot of evidence that shows a continuing relationship between him and the women who are charged in this matter.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And I recognize that there's an important distinction here between the accusers generally and those that are going to testify or may testify in this particular case.</p><p>[09:25:06] But what would you say to the public that is drawn by the sheer number of accusers, 80 or so women who have made a similar allegation about Harvey Weinstein?</p><p>ROTUNNO: Well, I think you have to look at those accusers with a very skeptical eye given the fact that the number that we hear in the media has absolutely nothing to do with what we're going to hear about in a criminal case. So when we hear this number, that number has nothing to do with what's happening in the criminal case and we, of course, are going to expect that the jury looks at the evidence and the evidence only.</p><p>And although we understand that that's a difficult task and something that's difficult to ask, we're going to make sure that we continue to remind them of that.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Right, but you'd have to be living under a rock not to know that there were dozens of women making a similar claim about Harvey Weinstein. How do you find a fair and impartial jury in that context?</p><p>ROTUNNO: I think in some ways, that number sort of helps us because once the jury sits down and the jury hears that this is only about two women, I think they start to wonder how truthful those other circumstances are or, if there were so many, why aren't they a part of the criminal case? So I think in some ways ...</p><p>SMERCONISH: You do ...</p><p>ROTUNNO: Go ahead.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I was going to say two women, right, but you do have to deal with the so called prior bad acts witnesses and my understanding is that you could be facing four of those in this, double the number of accusers. ROTUNNO: Yes. You're correct and we have to deal with those prior bad acts witnesses and we will do that. Their testimony, I think, in the end, will not be very compelling to the jurors for a variety of reasons and once the jury hears the evidence, they'll make that call, but we think that we have good evidence to be able to show that these circumstances don't rise to the level of what the prosecutors believe that they do.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is it easier or more difficult for you as a female defense attorney to cross-examine a female accuser?</p><p>ROTUNNO: In terms of easier, I mean, my male counterparts are just as qualified and able to do what I'm able to do, but I think my role as a woman is really more important in the effect of the listener. So when the listener watches me cross-examine a female, I think they view that differently. They view the questions I ask differently. I think that they look at men asking the same questions potentially as being bullying or maybe feeling sorry for the women when they're being questioned.</p><p>I think for me, a woman speaking to a woman is a different conversation and it has a different effect on the listener, which is the trier of fact ...</p><p>SMERCONISH: And ...</p><p>ROTUNNO: ... in our situation.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What if that female that you're cross-examining is a celebrity, like in this case Annabella Sciorra?</p><p>ROTUNNO: You know, Annabella Sciorra is an actress and she has spent an entire life acting for a living and I anticipate that she will be an excellent witness on the stand. I'm sure that she will be prepared to answer my questions, she will be ready for what I'm going to ask her and again, I think the circumstances and the facts and the evidence in the case will show to the jury that her statements don't rise to the level of what the prosecutor is asking the jury to convict Mr. Weinstein on.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And I come back to a question I asked previously which is one of, OK, but if Annabella Sciorra is telling one set of allegations or facts and you don't have Harvey Weinstein directly testifying to rebut that, can you nevertheless provide him with a successful defense?</p><p>ROTUNNO: Well, I think you're forgetting that our system of justice requires the government to prove Harvey Weinstein guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The system of justice does not require Mr. Weinstein to get up and prove himself innocent. That's not the -- that's not the foundation. The jury's going to be told that they cannot consider whether or not Mr. Weinstein testifies in their decision-making process.</p><p>And I think that once the jury sees the evidence and they see the communications and the conversation and the length of time that it took somebody to come forward, the fact that for years, she claimed nothing happened -- I mean, we have a wealth of evidence in our arsenal to be able to say that these cases don't rise to the level of rape.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Final question. On balance, the #MeToo movement, good or bad for women?</p><p>ROTUNNO: I think there are many good things that come from MeToo, but in the end, if MeToo strips you of your rights to due process and a fair trial, then as a criminal defense attorney, I have to say that there's problems with it.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Right. My question was for women. I think your answer is to refer to your client, Harvey Weinstein, the claim that he's been stripped of due process. I take it that's what you mean. Straighten me out if I'm wrong.</p><p>ROTUNNO: No. No, you're not wrong.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>But again, I'm not -- I'm not claiming that there are not good things that have come from MeToo. But in terms of it being good for women if we -- if we live under a system, whether it's the justice system, whether it's a system of social justice, to say that we must believe someone just because they make a claim, that's problematic for you, for me, and for every American citizen.</p><p>So it can't be that, you know, we just believe everything everybody says. There's cross-examination, there is -- there is our ability to ask questions in regard to get to the truth and get to the bottom of an allegation and that's what we're going to do.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Appreciate your time.</p><p>ROTUNNO: Thank you, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Pretrial conference on Monday, jury selection on Tuesday. Trial expected to last about eight weeks.</p><p>What has come in from social media? I think this comes in from Twitter.</p><p>Smerconish, perhaps today's survey question should have been, \"Will Harvey Weinstein have an advantage by securing a female attorney.\"</p><p>Brian, male, female, she's sharp. He's got quality counsel. You'd have to say that after watching that conversation, right?</p><p>Still to come, according to the Supreme Court a person burning an American flag is practicing their right of free speech, but a person burning a gay pride flag, someone who did that recently was slapped with a hate crime charge that normally carries a max of five years in prison.</p><p>My next guest says, a hate crime is only a step away from a criminalizing thought. Myron Magnet is standing by to explain his reasoning.</p><p>SMERCONISH: So what's the difference between regular crime and a hate crime? The Supreme Court upheld up in 1989 that burning the American flag is protected speech, but what if instead of red, white and blue the flag is made up of rainbow stripes? Are you free to burn that?</p><p>Last month a judge in Iowa sentenced a man to 16 years in prison for taking a gay pride flag from a nearby church and burning it in front of a strip club and expressing animosity toward the LGBT community. While his long sentence was partially due to his two previous felonies which made him a habitual offender, he was charged with a hate crime, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p><p>My next guest argues in his opinion piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\" that \"Hate Crime Is Only A Step Away From Thoughtcrime\" writing -- quote -- \"Designating an offense as a hate crime criminalizes not the action but the idea that supposedly impelled it. Here we are but a step away from the 'thoughtcrime' George Orwell described in '1984.'\"</p><p>With me now is Myron Magnet. He's the editor-at-large of \"City Journal.\" He's also the author of \"Clarence Thomas\" and the \"Lost Constitution.\"</p><p>Mr. Magnet, much of what you write makes sense to me. I've always struggled with this issue. But let's begin by saying that not all speech is deserving a protection by the First Amendment, defamatory speech.</p><p>[09:35:05]</p><p>You can't yell \"fire\" in a movie theater. I mean, there are some things that you just not permitted to say and act upon, right?</p><p>MYRON MAGNET, AUTHOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL PIECE: \"HATE CRIME IS ONLY A STEP AWAY FROM THOUGHTCRIME\": Yes, that's absolutely correct.</p><p>SMERCONISH: How do you deal with the anti-Semitism among us?</p><p>In today's \"New York Times\" by way of coincidence, I hope you can see this headline. If not, I'll read it to you.</p><p>MAGNET: Please, read it to me.</p><p>SMERCONISH: It says, scrutiny reveals a rise in anti-Semitic crimes. The data all indicating that anti-Semitism is on the rise.</p><p>I have a problem thinking that the person who spray paints a swastika on a synagogue is deserving of only the same punishment of someone who tags a subway station, graffiti in a subway station.</p><p>MAGNET: Oh, Michael, I --</p><p>SMERCONISH: how do you resolve those two issues? MAGNET: I agree with you, Michael. Remember that this man was also charged with harassment. It was third-degree harassment. We also have laws against intimidation. And if the person is shown to have the intent of terrorizing people from doing what their normal activities are, then that that's an additional crime and that should be punished accordingly.</p><p>So, the point is what did you want to do? We have laws going back to reconstruction that don't allow you, for instance, to terrorize free blacks, and these laws can be used all the time.</p><p>The point is, are you allowed to say I don't like the American government? Yes, you are. Are you allowed to say, I think that homosexuality is a sin, yes, you are. Are you allowed to say, I don't want a black person to live next to me. Yes, you are. But you cannot then do something to terrorize that black person or that Jewish person from buying the house or renting the apartment next to you. That's against the law.</p><p>So, it's actions --</p><p>SMERCONISH: But if I torch -- if I torch -- if I torch the rainbow flag, aren't I intimidating my gay neighbors?</p><p>MAGNET: If you're torching it in front of your guy neighbors' house and telling them, I hate you, then you are guilty of maybe harassment. I don't know that you're guilty of intimidation. But do you really want to send somebody to jail for 16 years for doing that?</p><p>SMERCONISH: \"The Wall Street Journal,\" your op-ed, had this summary of what's going on among us. \"The New York area has experienced a rash of what Governor Andrew Cuomo denounces as hate crimes. Swastikas have been scrawled in largely Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.</p><p>Adolescent thugs have assaulted Hasidim on the streets. In mid- December three customers and a cop were murdered in an attack on a Jersey City, New Jersey\" -- kosher's market -- kosher market in Jersey City. \"On Saturday, a madman stabbed five people at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, New York, north of the city.\"</p><p>Apply what you're expressing to me to those cases.</p><p>MAGNET: Oh, sure, I will. There are two things going on here.</p><p>One is there's a massive failure of law enforcement going on in New York City, in New York State so that we no longer do the broken windows quality of life policing that we started to do under Giuliani, which cut crime by 80 percent, which cut murders by over 80 percent. So when people know that the cops are watching, they do not do things like scrawling graffiti, including scrawling swastikas.</p><p>They know that the cops are watching. And so that the -- the pre- socialized -- the unsocialized adolescents don't act out in this way. The madmen living in the streets don't act out this way. That's what we had in the Monsey stabbings. And also failure of law enforcement. This guy had a whole bunch of anti-psychotic medication that he didn't take. We have Kendra's Law in New York which says that if you're a crazy person, you got to take your meds, or you'll be locked up in a psychiatric ward and made (ph) to (ph) (INAUDIBLE). That's thing one.</p><p>Thing two is it would be very nice if black leaders like Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan did not preach anti-Semitism, if we had not had the crown heights incitement 30 years ago, of three days of rioting left to go. So, that when they're -- and not to say that most blacks are anti-Semite. It's to say that when you have poorly socialized kids or crazy people who are looking for somebody to take their hostility out on, then they're going to take it out on Jews. To call it a hate crime --</p><p>SMERCONISH: Let me ask you a direct question --</p><p>MAGNET: -- is that going to make it -- is that going to make it -- is that going to stop it? I don't think so.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK. But the madman who breaks into the rabbi's house and stabs five people --</p><p>[09:40:05]</p><p>MAGNET: Yes --</p><p>SMERCONISH: -- hate crime, yes or no?</p><p>MAGNET: No.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You're not going to -- you're not going to -- so you're going treat him as if he were someone who went into a different home, not with an apparent religious bias on which he was acting?</p><p>MAGNET: What -- what -- what -- what --what would the difference be, Michael? He is a -- an attempted murderer, right?</p><p>SMERCONISH: Right.</p><p>MAGNET: What more can you give him? What more can you give him beyond the many years he will get for attempted murder or --</p><p>SMERCONISH: Well, the argument -- the argument -- I'll give you the argument --</p><p>MAGNET: But -- but hang on, hang on. Hang on just one second.</p><p>OK. Hang on just one second. The law --</p><p>SMERCONISH: The argument is this. The argument is that a person like that is inspiring, instilling fear in a particular community unlike the guy that breaks into your house or my house and acts likewise. Quickly, but you get the final word.</p><p>MAGNET: Yes. But the question is it's the person who committed the crime who's on trial, and the law can ask only two things about his state of mind. Is he sane and did he intend to do the crime. And that's it. You're a lawyer. You know that.</p><p>SMERCONISH: By the way, that look of yours, what do you think for me? I've got part of it going here?</p><p>MAGNET: Well, you know, when the hair goes on top, you should put some of it on the bottom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMERCONISH: My sentiments exactly. Myron Magnet, thank you.</p><p>MAGNET: Such a pleasure, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I hope that you are answering the survey question, folks, at Smerconish.com.</p><p>\"Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani?\" Results very soon.</p><p>Still to come, what law did California just passed about doctors giving vaccine exemptions and like many other novel regulations devised in the Golden State, will this, too, go national?</p><p>SMERCONISH: While California has often been on the vanguard of the nation's cultural shifts -- think hula hoop, Frisbee, skateboards, McDonalds, it also often leads the way in legislation. Changes that often cause the rest of the country to initially snicker, have a way of eventually migrating east.</p><p>[09:45:05]</p><p>So, every year I like to look at what laws California has just enacted. In the past, such measures have included everything from no- fault divorce, marijuana decriminalization. By the way, they're not always liberal. Consider California's move to ban affirmative action or enact property tax reform.</p><p>Anybody remember Howard Jarvis? Well, hundreds of new California laws took effect on January 1st. Which ones might become nationwide?</p><p>Joining me now is John Myers. He's the Sacramento bureau chief for the \"L.A. Times.\" He co-authored the piece \"How Will California's New Laws Affect You?\"</p><p>Hey, John, I want to tick through four or five of them if we have time. Let's begin with independent contractors. What's the change there?</p><p>JOHN MYERS, SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF, LOS ANGELES TIMES: Yes. This is an interesting one, Michael. I mean, this really is a debate about the nature of work, I think, in the 21st century. There was a California Supreme Court ruling that said -- that limited the use of independent contractors in businesses said that there had to be a strict litmus test as to who could be an employee and who could be a contractor. This codifies it but this has been an intense debate about when it's appropriate to have an independent contractor.</p><p>There are people who say, look, if you're not an employee, you don't get benefits, you don't pay payroll taxes. On the other side people who are like the independent contractors like the flexibility and the freedom of that.</p><p>So this says that there are strict limits. There is a litmus test to this. And I can tell you the real flash point out of all of this, Michael, has been the big tech companies Uber and Lyft whose business model depends on independent contractor don't want this to apply to them and have threatened to take it to California voters in the fall to exclude them from this new law.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Yes. I can see their argument that it will stifle the sort of entrepreneurship that has made them so successful. Let me go to number two.</p><p>Consumer privacy. John, I've read a lot about it. I don't think I still understand it. Explain it to me.</p><p>MYERS: I think a lot of people are still trying to figure this one out. You're absolutely right.</p><p>I mean, at its -- at its most basic, I think, this is an easy one to understand. Consumers have the right in California to know who is sharing their data, who is buying their data, and they have the right to tell the company, delete my personal data. This is going to have a national impact, I mean, there's no doubt about it. These are large U.S. companies that have to react and have to change their business processes.</p><p>We are already seeing on Web sites little icons, little remove my data logos that have been put up in the last few weeks. There are a few months to figure this out. The implementation doesn't fully kick in until the summer. But this is a big topic now about privacy, of consumer data.</p><p>And I will tell you, Michael, there is a move to even strengthen this brand-new law this year and, again, give consumers more power over that information.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Control of data has become a big revenue source for many businesses. You'll laugh, but I saw an episode of \"Shark Tank\" this week that reminded me of this fact where companies acquire other companies simply because they want access to that information. So it will have quite a significant ripple effect.</p><p>Here's number three on my list. The president on a national level has been dismantling the Affordable Care Act and yet here in California the individual mandate is alive and well.</p><p>MYERS: Yes. No state has embraced the Obamacare law over the last several years more than California in a lot of ways. And so you're right. When President Trump and Republicans in Congress effectively killed the individual mandate, California now says, well, you've got to have health insurance in California.</p><p>So effective now, all Californians are required to have health insurance. They -- and it will -- it will work pretty much like the national law, the level of coverage that you would have to have. And if you don't have it, it's a penalty on your taxes that you pay next year, and that money actually goes into providing subsidies for health care insurance for Californians who are middle-class in their income.</p><p>Again, this is the limits, I think, of what a state can do, especially a state -- a Democratic liberal state like California in the face of the Trump administration and the efforts in Washington.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Rising housing prices, a homeless problem that is related, have led to a cap on rental increases. Explain that to me.</p><p>MYERS: Yes. This is a statewide cap on how much rent can go up. It says that rent can't go up more than 5 percent a year for the next decade across California. Now, there are cities in California that already have rent control rules. Los Angeles and San Francisco for some renters.</p><p>This is statewide. This is much broader. This is one effort in that big issue that you're referencing there. I mean California has an affordable housing crisis, homelessness crisis that is a subset and offset of that. This is one effort to try to get a look at that that say these renters need some predictability in what they are paying month to month.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Finally, there have been a number of high-profile controversies on the subject of vaccinations. What's the change in that regard?</p><p>MYERS: Yes. This one really I would say, Michael, is a viral media effect here of -- especially people who are critics of vaccines and who have asserted they don't want their children to go through the vaccine protocol.</p><p>[09:50:03]</p><p>Of course you have to have the vaccines to go to school. The state has been talking a lot about limiting the number of exemptions that are given to kids from these vaccine protocols. This new law simply gives the state public health department a lot more oversight into doctors writing these medical exemptions. Says they're going to review them. Says the doctors who write too many medical exemptions are going to have their practices reviewed.</p><p>This was fiercely debated by scores of vaccination critic parents and by vaccination supporters here in Sacramento and the California state capital. I don't think we've heard the end of it but this is going to give the state more oversight of who gets exempted from those vaccine rules.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey, John, final question. What is it about California? Why is California so often on the vanguard -- I said at the outset when I was introducing this conversation, sometimes looked at derisively by the rest of the country. And then these things end up migrating eastward. But what is it that makes your state such a laboratory?</p><p>MYERS: You know, it's a good question. I've lived out here about 25 years. And I tend to think that California's dream is an experimentation of the American dream. It's ways to make the American dream better. At least that's the premise that I think a lot of lawmakers and a lot of Californians began with.</p><p>And I think there is this notion that you have to figure out where the level of government should be. You said it very well at the top. It's not all liberal. It has been conservative in the past but it is an experimentation.</p><p>And I would also tell you quickly I think it is this merging of what elected officials can do in a California state legislature and what voters can do on the ballot in California. And there is a push/pull pressure there of like, if we don't act in elected office they're going to act at the ballot box.</p><p>So there is experimentation. And we get criticized for it some but as California goes, so goes the country a lot. And I think in some of the laws we've talked about this morning, you're going to see a national conversation moving forward because of what's been happening here.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Beach Boys, Van Halen, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thank you, John.</p><p>MYERS: Thanks so very much.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Still to come, your best and worst tweets and Facebook comments and your final chance to vote in today's survey question at Smerconish.com.</p><p>\"Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani?\"</p><p>Go vote.</p><p>[09:56:01]</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey, time to see how you responded to the survey question at Smerconish.com.</p><p>\"Was President Trump justified in ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani?\"</p><p>Survey says this -- 72 percent say no. Wow, with nearly -- with more than 15,000 votes. I'm really surprised by that. Because I think it was justified, but \"The New York Times\" in a lead editorial today has a really -- it's like they anticipated today's survey question. Can we put the first paragraph up?</p><p>Listen to this. \"The real question to ask about the American drone attack that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani was not whether it was justified, but whether it was wise.\"</p><p>Many pieces of the puzzle are still missing, but the killing is a big leap in an uncertain direction. I think they probably have a better question than I had. Not the justification, but the wise question.</p><p>Here's some social media that came in during the course of the program. What do we have?</p><p>Smerconish, wrong question. Trump may be justified but it doesn't mean it was the right thing to do.</p><p>Janet, there you go, you're on the same page as \"The New York Times.\" I think he was probably justified, as Obama would have been justified, as W would have been justified. But wise? Unclear.</p><p>What else? The lead attorney for Harvey Weinstein is no joke. The prosecution better be on their game. The art of lawyering.</p><p>Mitsubishi, I thought she was sharp as well. I thought -- you know what I thought was interesting? Because one of the more interesting moments in that trial is going to be when Annabella Sciorra, man, I loved her in \"The Sopranos,\" when she testifies. And when I asked what it will be like to cross examine a celebrity -- actually I said, a female cross examining a female who also happens to be a celebrity. Did you hear what she said? I'm sure she will be a great witness and she has spent her entire life acting. Maybe I'm reading too much into that I thought there was a message there.</p><p>Hey, join me for my \"American Life in Columns\" tour.

And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran written all over it. President Trump's take on the tanker attacks yesterday. The chips are down. Broadcom's forecasts send a trade war warning. And the Swiss strike back. Women across Switzerland walking out of work, calling for greater quality. It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Happy Friday and a Happy Friday for stock investors. Again, we are just two percent away from record highs. I'll be asking throughout the show, is that justified? Ultimately, as I walk you through the fallout from the tensions in the Middle East and what we saw yesterday with the tanker attacks, but also some pretty concerning data from around the world, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now U.S. futures, a little bit softer. We did manage half a percent gains yesterday despite these tensions that I mentioned. The energy sector of course, performing well.</p><p>Today though, it's all about the tech sector especially the chip stocks. Broadcom dashing hopes of a business pick up later this year. The trade war, Huawei, you mentioned it, we've got all the details for you in a second.</p><p>Everywhere you look though, I'm seeing signs of broader concerns, the weight of the trade war of filtering in here. China, retail sales numbers there held up pretty well, I have to say that the industrial output numbers, those growing at the weakest pace in 17 years.</p><p>The U.S. version is out in 15 minutes, so we'll be all over that. But for now, we did see a solid retail sales numbers in line with estimates. The U.S. consumer remains resilient. But hey, before we get too excited, compare and contrast Morgan Stanley's U.S. business conditions index has just had the biggest monthly drop on record. Fine. It's just one month and we did see a pullback in the stock markets in May of course, too.</p><p>But now more than 600 U.S. firms warning the U.S. government about further Chinese tariffs. We'll talk about that, too. But all sorts of signs here and warnings don't do more. Please, the U.S. government.</p><p>What's going on in the energy sector? A U.S. oil prices study today after that four percent rise that we saw yesterday after the twin tanker attacks. The U.S. firmly blaming Iran and tensions, of course not easing there. But you have to argue here the dominant driver for prices is bumpy U.S. supply and demand fears.</p><p>Let's break this down. Get to the drivers. Iran has said the U.S. government's tanker accusations are quote \"sad, and a suspicious act\" while the U.S. says this footage shows the Iranian Navy removing an unexploded mine from one of those crippled tankers.</p><p>Donald Trump just told Fox News that the incident had Iran written all over it. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, Iran did do it, and you know, they did it because you saw the boat. I guess one of the mines didn't explode, and it probably got essentially Iran written all over it.</p><p>And you saw the boat at night trying to take the mine off and successfully took the mine off the boat, and that was exposed and that was a boat that was them. And they didn't want the evidence left behind. I guess they don't know that we have things that we can detect in the dark that worked very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we've got John Defterios for us in Abu Dhabi, Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran. First to Fred, I'm going to come to you first. Extraordinarily quick to accuse the Iranians here whether it was Mike Pompeo, of course, and the President this morning.</p><p>But talk us through this video as well, and the evidence perhaps that provides.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're absolutely right, Julia and the Iranians really aren't very happy about the fact that the U.S. was very quick to point the finger at Tehran. First of all, of course, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and then what we've just seen now, President Trump essentially saying the same thing.</p><p>Now according to the U.S. Military, what's going on in that video the U.S. says is that this was taken a long time after that attack initially took place. The U.S. said it already had a ship in the area, but that little patrol boat from the Iranians then came up to one of those stricken tankers, came up to the side.</p><p>And that essentially the U.S. says, the crew of that Iranian patrol boat then took an object off the side of that tanker which the U.S. believes may have been an unexploded sea mine. And it was therefore trying to get rid of some of the evidence the U.S. believes against Iran.</p><p>Now the Iranians, of course, having none of that saying that these are false accusations that are being levied by the United States. There's one senior Iranian lawmaker who came out and essentially says the main suspects in all of this are the U.S. Intelligence services and the Israelis.</p><p>[09:05:08] PLEITGEN: Obviously also not to offer any sort of evidence to back that up. But you can really feel how the rhetoric certainly isn't being toned down in any way, shape or form, Julia. In fact, it is indeed being heated up.</p><p>On the one hand, you have President Trump and his accusations that we heard just there and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. On the other hand, you have the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who just a few minutes ago, he's at an economic forum right now tweeted the following saying that \"Unilateral U.S. actions, including its economic terrorism on Iran are solely responsible for insecurity and renewed tensions in our region.\"</p><p>So the Iranians not only saying they didn't do it, but they're the ones who are saying that the U.S. is the one that's fueling and fanning the flames in the greater Middle Eastern region -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the Foreign Minister said it was war mongering, the accusations from the United States here. I mean, I think everybody here is wondering what now? We've seen a ratcheting up of the tensions, the accusations from the United States on Iran. They're accusing the U.S. of economic terrorism here, what now?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, the big question is, are these two sides able to walk this back right now? Is there going to be some sort of way to move forward to try and essentially prevent this from escalating any further?</p><p>Certainly right now, what the U.S. is saying is that all this is being investigated that apparently, authorities are out there at those two tanker boats, and trying to see what exactly happened there.</p><p>But the U.S., of course, has now already laid the finger of blame at the Iranians. And if we look at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's press conference yesterday, he wasn't just saying that. He was also saying the other tanker attacks were also done by Iran. He was accusing the Iranians of an attack on a pipeline in Saudi Arabia, its allies, the Houthis coming from Yemen.</p><p>So also laying the finger of blame at the Iranians for a lot of things that are going on in the greater Middle Eastern region, and essentially accusing them of destabilizing the region.</p><p>Now, of course, as you can imagine, the Iranians, for their part are not happy about that at all. And if you look at yesterday, when the Supreme Leader of Iran met with Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, he said, \"Look, it's not even worth negotiating with someone like President Trump.\"</p><p>He said he wouldn't even give President Trump an answer when President Trump wanted those negotiator trying to start those negotiations with the Iranians. So right now, it's going to be very, very difficult to try and prevent this from escalating any further -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that is quite fascinating to me all, the reaction that we saw in the oil markets yesterday. And, John, the lack of reaction that we're seeing today, despite what is an escalation of tensions here and to Fred's point, too similar to our reporting events within a month. JD, what do you make of it? There's clearly other dominant factors here for investors that are weighing on oil prices.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's extraordinary because we're in a risk on environment, as we were talking about here.</p><p>You've had the tanker attacks, an attack against a pumping station for Saudi Aramco, even an airport in Saudi Arabia and it's just barely moving the needle. But I think the three key factors at play here that are impacting prices. First and foremost, the U.S. trade sanctions whether against China, Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, or the threats against Mexico, it's hitting demand.</p><p>The International Energy Agency put out its latest report saying the daily demand growth is now down to just 1.2 million barrels a day; sharply lower than last year. U.S. production is surging, Julia.</p><p>The expectation is between 2018 and by the end of this year, the U.S. is going to add 3.5 million barrels a day. It's like adding another UAE to the energy market, and it's a major OPEC producer.</p><p>And finally, we see that the call on OPEC production right now is at the lowest level since 2014. It's below 30 million barrels a day.</p><p>So the U.S. is rising, it is forcing OPEC to cut back. Iran, Venezuela, Libya all see the production lower. At the end of the day, the two key players in the OPEC, non-OPEC stratosphere right now. Saudi Arabia and Russia are looking at the five year moving average. Because of the uncertainty of the economy right now, inventories are growing. So this is going to put pressure on them at their next meeting in Vienna, not to release more oil onto the market, and perhaps make a deeper cut.</p><p>This will be an interesting meeting, because they have Iran and Venezuela at the table with U.S. sanctions hammering away at those two countries, with the U.S., Saudi Arabia and UAE partners here with the pressure on against Iran.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And we're talking nonstop about the back and forth between the United States and the Iranians here. But there are other countries involved, particularly in the region right now, John, what are they saying about the situation just keeping a little bit quiet here?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, they don't like the idea that we could stumble into war. This is the definition here constantly. So we have this access of power against Iran. I would include Israel in the mix, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt.</p><p>And this could be something that could trigger something much worse than the oil markets, if it spirals out of control. You know, it's interesting because I've been in this oil market for 25 years. You go back to the Gulf War, for example, the Iran-Iraq War, the invasion of Iraq, even the removal of Colonel Qaddafi.</p><p>[09:10:17] DEFTERIOS: Julia, we'd see spikes 10 to 15 percent, with anything around the Strait of Hormuz. And right now we saw a blip going up four and a half percent losing the gains entirely. And we have to take a step back, we're in a bear market since the end of April, we've lost $15.00 or about 20 percent, whether it's WTI or North Sea Brent.</p><p>There's just too much oil around and the United States is going to go past 13 million barrels a day, while President Trump's pressure on sanctions is slowing down global growth. That's the reality of why the markets not reacting to the pressure we have in this region.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a negative sentiment tranquilizer on steroids. John Defterios, thank you so much for that. And Fred, of course, over in Tehran for us, too.</p><p>All right. Let's move on to our second drive. Of course, the Iranian situation not the only foreign policy challenge that the United States is facing. China, too. Six hundred firms here in the United States warning President Trump and the administration about the risks of further tariffs on the Chinese.</p><p>They say more times will cost U.S. jobs and harm millions of American consumers. Clare Sebastian has the story for us, and it's not just the ordinary U.S. firms. I mean, these are giants -- Walmart, Costco -- urging the President to remove tariffs and not to add further, Clare. Tell us more.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this reads Julia like a who's who of the biggest retailers in the U.S. Walmart, Target, Costco, as you say the likes of, Footlocker, Levi Strauss, Macy's as well. These are, you know, some huge employers.</p><p>Walmart employs 1.5 million people in the U.S. It's the biggest private sector employer and you can bet if they are threatening to raise prices. The many, many smaller companies on the list are doing it as well.</p><p>There's a lot of pressure on these companies and actually, Julia, I spoke to one of these smaller companies this week, a bike and bicycle pot wholesaler called Kent International. And their President explained to me how the pressure on the company is increasing. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD, KAMLER, PRESIDENT, KENT INTERNATIONAL: We had to raise prices immediately. But our customers have policies where they don't accept price increases right away. And so in the time gap, which was about 75 days, we had literally one and a half to two months of time when we were paying these additional tariffs and yet we couldn't pass it on. So we suffered quite a bit of losses during that period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: He says he lost about $3.5 million. He also said that ocean freight costs rose in that time because many people were rushing to get their products to the U.S. before the tariff increases came in.</p><p>But Julia, so far with the $200 billion in tariffs that have been hit, consumer goods have been broadly insulated. If another $300 billion gets hit by tariffs, you can bet this will be a direct hit to consumer products. And that's why we see so many retailers so worried.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and they can't substitute quick enough. I mean, we're talking of price increases of some 16 percent, so they were saying.</p><p>Yes, we'll see what the response is. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, next driver. The chip maker, Broadcom down some nine percent premarket. They lowered their full-year outlook warning of a demand slowdown due to the trade will impact and of course, the direct response at the ban on Huawei, of course on their technology.</p><p>Matt Egan joins me now. Matt, a blow for the entire industry here, I think, because everyone was hoping that we'd see a bit of a pickup in the second half of this year and Broadcom saying, \"not happening.\"</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right, Julia, not happening. It's clear that the chip makers are getting hit by a one two punch here of the trade war with China and a global slowdown in growth and Broadcom cited both factors in dramatically lowering its revenue forecast for the rest of the year by about $2 billion.</p><p>The company also pointed to the U.S. export ban on Huawei, which accounted for nearly a billion dollars in direct revenue for Broadcom last year.</p><p>Now Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, he said that he is seeing a -- he said that the environment is very, very nervous. And he's saying that he is seeing a very rapid and sharp contraction in orders.</p><p>Now, those are pretty stark words from a major CEO and Hock Tan did not shy away from blaming the trade war specifically. He said that it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty.</p><p>Now that gloomy sentiment from Broadcom has further dashed those hopes of a second half turnaround in the chip industry. We've seen AMD and Micron and Qualcomm and NVIDIA, Intel all move down premarket.</p><p>Apple which relies on Broadcom chips for some of its products is also set to open down last check about one percent. Now, Julia, I think all this bears watching because the chip industry is looked at as an economic bellwether and just yesterday, billionaire investor Jeff Gundlach said he does think there's something to this idea that the trade war is contributing to a global slowdown.</p><p>[09:15:13] EGAN: And he thinks there's a 40 to 45 percent chance of a U.S. recession within six months.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. I mean, he tends to be a bear. I guess we counter it slightly with that. But when you're talking about a company like Huawei that outsells Apple, in terms of smartphones, and the supply chain is so huge as far as network equipment is concerned, you kind of have to see a reaction more broadly than just initial sales like we see the chips. It's a great point. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. President Trump appears to be backtracking from his statement that he would accept foreign dirt on his opponents.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News, the President said there's nothing wrong with accepting the information. However, he would turn it over to the F.B.I.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via phone): I don't think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody's going to present me with anything.</p><p>But number two, if I was and of course, you have to look at it. Because if you don't look at it, you're not going to know if it's bad. How are you going to know if it's bad, but of course you give it to the FBI or report it to the Attorney General or somebody like that.</p><p>But of course you do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: President Trump also declined to offer any new details on whether China's President Xi plans to meet with him at the upcoming G20 Summit.</p><p>Female lawmakers in Kenya stormed out of a Parliament in protest after a male member of Parliament allegedly assaulted a female lawmaker.</p><p>MP Fatima Gedi, who you see here says Rashid Kassim punched her several times in the mouth and jaw after confronting her over a budget issue on Thursday. He is now being arrested.</p><p>All right, still to come here on FIRST MOVE. Oil on troubled waters as tensions rise over attacks on tankers and the Gulf of Oman. We seek to a former Ambassador who says the U.S. should fight fire with fire.</p><p>And breaking up is hard to do. The CEO of Google pushes back against moves to cut his company into smaller pieces. Our exclusive interview coming up. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:20:24] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We're looking at a lower open for stock markets. All the focus on the tech sector. In particular this morning, in light of what we've been talking about, chip maker Broadcom's warning and fears that the second half bounce for the chip stocks won't happen.</p><p>Some perspective here is important though, too. That Semi-Conductor Conductor Index is still up some 20 percent here today, even as it's down 12 percent from the April highs that we saw.</p><p>We are still on track more broadly for a second straight week of gains here, but continue to watch the signs in the bond market. That 10-year treasury yield sitting around 2.1 percent on broader growth. That said, we have to point out that the economic numbers today were good.</p><p>Industrial production numbers just out, up better than expected to 0.4 percent in May following solid retail sales numbers for May out earlier, too.</p><p>Let's talk all this through. Jonathan Golub is Managing Director and Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Credit Suisse, and he joins us now. Great to have you with us.</p><p>JONATHAN GOLUB, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE: Good morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about retail sales. Solid number here. The consumer holding up pretty well in the face of border uncertainty.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, but the key for the consumer is that jobs are abundant, the unemployment rate is low. So if you lose your job, it's very easy to get one and you're getting a raise. So the consumers are in great shape. The cyclical data, especially on the industrial side, and I know the industrial productions a little better today, but it's been sloppy, really for the last year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It has. And we saw yesterday and I mentioned it earlier on the show, actually Morgan Stanley's Business Conditions Index was splashed all over the financial news and websites over the last 24 hours as a warning for May.</p><p>How closely should we be following things like that and the business surveys at this stage, which are showing kind of conditions, the market selloff in May? The broader trade tension?</p><p>GOLUB: It's the most important question, because if you look at what the surveys, they tell you what businesses intend to do and a funny thing, when they say they intend to cut back, they tend to actually do that.</p><p>If you look at what they call the hard data, which is the actual production itself, it tends to be a little bit more lagging. So we're very focused on this survey data that you're talking about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And it brings it back again to trade war concerns and the level of uncertainty that we continue to have hear, whether we're going to see more tariffs on China or a deal fundamentally reached. It's tough for businesses to make decisions.</p><p>GOLUB: I think there's two issues. First, if we step back and said there was nothing going on with trade whatsoever, we've seen a weakening of this industrial type activity now for quite a while.</p><p>So I think that the most important thing is to separate this out as we were seeing a deceleration regardless. But yes, if businesses are making a long-term decision, if I want to relocate my factory or retool a plant or initiate a new project, very, very difficult for businesses to do that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. So the Fed.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It has to work out how it's going to message to the market here. The consumer, the retail sales is holding up, as you said, even if we strip out the trade war impact on the economy, the underlying economy was weakening. How do you justify potential rate cuts in the face of sort of mixed messages here as far as the economy is concerned.</p><p>GOLUB: The Fed is all about interest rates, and right now, the yield curve is steeply inverted at the short-end of the curve. And putting in simpler terms, the short rate is just too high compared to the general level of rates for the rest of the market. And the market is bullying the Fed to lower rates.</p><p>If we didn't have a trade issue, the Fed would still have to lower rates. Why? Inflation expectations are super low. Interest rates are falling now, about 120 basis points, 1.2 percent since November.</p><p>The market is telling you that rates are too high and again, is trade part of it? Yes. But it's not the only story.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: See that's a fascinating point to me. So arguably, the fact can say that, look, we're looking at inflation at this moment. We're looking at the data. That's what we do. That's our job. There is uncertainties out there. But you know, we need to get some easing.</p><p>GOLUB: The reason I'm smiling is that what the Fed really should be saying is, is that we're -- that they're off sides, that they tighten too much and they need to pull back. They're not going to say that they made a mistake, which is probably the case. What they're going to say is \"Oh, we're using this as an insurance policy.\"</p><p>The market is going to look right through that and realize that in fact, they are easing because the rate is too high.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, I call it the Fed pirouette. We've seen one pivot, make sure it keeps spinning basically, if they've wrecked the cake, how many times will they cut this year then?</p><p>GOLUB: Our view is that they cut once this year, but the market is saying and it's what's important, the market thinks if they cut three times this year and one time, so the fact the market thinks that they have to cut 100 basis points, one percent, it really means that the market believes the Fed is off side and needs to take action.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so when I started the show today, I said should we be two percent away from record highs more broadly in the U.S. stock market? And some of the justification I get is that rates have come down and that support stocks.</p><p>[09:25:27] GOLUB: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've done some analysis on this, on the relationship between lower rates here and the performance of stocks. So two questions there.</p><p>GOLUB: Okay, so there's again -- is this a short term or long term?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: In the short run, when rates are falling, it's a signal that something is broken, and so by rates going down this much in the last five months, it's really telling you that the economy is taking on more -- under more pressure than we think. And it and it is stressed that way.</p><p>And so we've kind of -- and we've been really bullish for the last five years. This is the first time we're saying, you know what? Maybe now is not the time to jump in and buy every dip. Longer term, the real key here is the companies are responding. They are doing a great job of managing costs. They're returning dividends back to shareholders very high. We like U.S. stocks longer term, but the near term, a little more spicy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So be careful in the near term.</p><p>GOLUB: If you had a two or three year horizon, I'm absolutely a buyer. Would I be jumping in this morning? I'm not sure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's my response. Jonathan, thank you so much. Obviously popular on the floor as well, sir. Thank you so much. Great to have you here.</p><p>GOLUB: Good to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy Friday. All right. We're counting down to the market open this morning. As you can see, Chewy actually is listing today, so no animals around, but lots of cute pictures. We'll see how that performs when it opens up later today, but plenty more to discuss to on the show. Stay with us. The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:01] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley from the New York Stock Exchange here. That was the opening bell on Wall Street where pet food and supply company, Chewy is going public today.</p><p>Chewy is the internet arm of retailer Pet Smart. Share prices actually priced at $22.00 a share, so that's above the target range. They've raised around $1 billion. It's another example of how the pet business has become a pretty big business. And there was a very cute dog on the balcony I saw there.</p><p>Now, forget the fun, but it's going to be a bit of a rough start. Yes, sorry. They didn't write that out on Wall Street. In more ways than one, as you can see stocks losing a bit of ground here. The biggest drop for the NASDAQ, some four tenths of one percent. Weak Chinese factory data and of course, poor results from chip maker Broadcom as we've been discussing weighing on sentiment.</p><p>Though there is the bright side here. The industrial production numbers that we just got from the United States came in above expectations. U.S. retail sales also, those numbers coming in pretty solidly, too.</p><p>All right let me walk you through our global movers. Broadcom, let's take a look at how that's been going well. Bouncing seven and a half percent. The chip maker revenues missed expectations. It lowered his full-year revenue guidance, too. They blamed the demand slow down on the trade tensions between the United States and China and of course, Huawei's export restrictions, too.</p><p>We're seeing the broader sector under a bit of pressure as a result of that, too, and in the European session, in fact.</p><p>Facebook higher by 1.7 percent. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the social network's new cryptocurrency will be called Libra, and it's getting backing from more than a dozen companies including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Uber. The digital coin will be unveiled next week, and it's set to launch next year.</p><p>Blue Apron, down nine and a half percent in the session. Ouch. The misery continues for the meal kit company. The board approved a one for 15 reversed stock split that goes into effect after Friday's market close.</p><p>It's now trading as you can see it just over 59 cents a share. Ouch. All right, let's move on. The controversy over attacks on oil tankers maybe heating up, but as you can see the energy market's reaction is looking a lot cooler today. Investors shrugging off the floor its trading as you can see just higher by some six tenths of one percent for Brent, twelve tenths of 1 percent higher for WTI.</p><p>This is the video that's ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. said it shows an Iranian naval vessel coming up alongside one of the tankers, a Japanese ship in fact, and removing an unexploded mine. U.S. officials believe Tehran was trying to get rid of the evidence.</p><p>Our next guest wrote recently that the United States should take an eye for an eye approach with the Iranian leadership. If they attack an Emirati ship, we should attack an Iranian ship. That's a quote. And that's the only language the Iranian leadership understands.</p><p>Adam Ereli is a former U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain. He also served as Deputy State Department spokesperson, and he joins us now from Washington. Ambassador, that's a pretty punchy response. Would you argue that if indeed, Iran is responsible for this latest attack, it's a direct result of a lack of action from the events that we saw less than a month ago?</p><p>ADAM ERELI, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO BAHRAIN: Short answer is yes. And yes, I don't think there's any question and I don't think the question is if Iran is responsible. You know, there are those who -- I mean, Iran is denying. There's no reason to believe them. There are others who think this might be a false flag operation. That's patently ridiculous.</p><p>Number three, you know, everybody is looking at these latest events as if they are some one-off. But we have a pattern of behavior by Iran over the past 40 years since 1979, when the revolution came to power of attacking American and American targets, and those of its allies. And there's never been a response by the United States.</p><p>So my point is simply this. Iran will continue to test us and see how far it can go. Unless there's a brush back from us, unless they're forced to pay a price. Until now that hasn't happened, and as a result, we've seen a pattern of aggressive actions, not only in the last several months, but over the last 40 years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Some people would look at what you're saying here and go, \"Hang on a second. Why is it the United States' responsibility to respond if they are Iranians attack an Emirati ship or a Saudi ship?\" Isn't it a responsibility of other nations in that region to respond, too and not just leave it to the United States to take care of military action here, because that's what we're arguing?</p><p>[09:35:13] ERELI: Well, I would qualify that. First of all, the United States is a superpower, we ought to act like one. We're the only country with the capability to attack quickly, precisely, and effectively. No other country in the world has that. So that's point one.</p><p>Point two, we have made a commitment to secure freedom of navigation in this part of the world. That is a commitment we need to stand by, or our word means nothing.</p><p>Finally, number three, just because Saudi Arabia and Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates aren't pulling the trigger, they are providing significant and I mean, significant logistical, material, political support for U.S. forces. We operate as a coalition, and this would not be the United States going it alone.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why isn't President Trump acting here? In the article that you wrote, you said, \"Look, he's afraid that it will costing votes in 2020.\" Explain?</p><p>ERELI: Well, two points. You know, Trump is nothing if not consistent, right? I mean, he might seem to be a loose cannon and a wild card. But if you actually look carefully at what he said, and what he's done, there is a method to the apparent madness.</p><p>Number one, he said he wants to -- he doesn't want to get America involved in any wars, and he wants to get America out of the wars that it's in.</p><p>So in Afghanistan and Syria, he has been very aggressive about pulling us out. The only reason a small number of American troops remain there is because his military advisers convinced him that it was necessary to do.</p><p>He is not going to get into another -- he doesn't want to get into another conflict with Iran.</p><p>Now, my point is, this isn't a question of full scale war or peace, you can -- you can take limited surgical strikes against Iranian targets without going to a full scale war.</p><p>But the final point is this. Trump doesn't want the price of oil to go up because that hurts the U.S. economy. That's been a bedrock of his foreign policy with Saudi Arabia and others, keep the price moderate, number one. Number two, he doesn't want to lose votes in 2020.</p><p>His eye is on November 2020 and all of his decision making is with that in mind.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think in any kind of relationship, and you can educate me better on this, Ambassador, you have to have an end game. You have to know what your end game is. Is it bringing Iran around the table for negotiations? Because I wonder how the attack for the attack and the eye for an eye achieves that? Because at this moment, we see the United States very quick to point the finger at Iran, whether that's right or wrong. I just don't see an exit.</p><p>I don't see the ability for Iran here or an opportunity for them to be able to back down and negotiate because that will look like weakness here, too.</p><p>ERELI: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's the endgame here?</p><p>ERELI: Well, it depends who you ask and when. But, the administration says the end game is very simple. It's to have Iran be a responsible member of the international community, to abandon its nuclear program, abandon its support for terrorism. And live in peace with its neighbors. All right, that's the endgame.</p><p>Now they've chosen a number of tactics to achieve that. Number one, they've imposed a brutal sanctions regime on the government of Iran in order to deny the resources it uses to fund terror. Second, it has opened the door to negotiations saying our goal of negotiation is not just the nuclear program, but all your troublesome behavior.</p><p>To think that Iran is going to do that is crazy in my view, but at least we're trying. Number three, and this is where I get to the use of military force. Deterrence is an important part of that strategy. Yes, you can have negotiations; yes, you can have a path forward. But if Iran tests us, if Iran challenges us, if Iran tries to intimidate us and our allies, and threaten international peace and security by bombing oil tankers in the part of the world where 30 percent of seaborne oil exports or oil trade goes through, then we have to act.</p><p>We can't be -- how should I put it? We can't be afraid of taking decisive action in defense of our interests when those interests are challenged, and Iran is doing just that. And we're staying quiet and holding our powder, keeping our powder dry. I don't know why.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ambassador, very quickly, what do the Iranian people want here?</p><p>ERELI: Well, I think what the Iranian people want is clear. And they've been saying that in a very loud and clear voice since December of 2017. We're talking about really almost 18 months.</p><p>[09:40:07] ERELI: They have been in the streets, interestingly saying that they have lost faith in the Islamic Revolution, which brought the current regime to power in 1979.</p><p>Never before have Iranian protester said, we don't believe in the Revolution, we don't believe in the Supreme Leader, we don't believe in our leadership. The game is over is quote what they say, \"Death to Rouhani. Death to the dictator.\"</p><p>So the Iranian people, you know, the they don't see the United States as the enemy. They see their own leadership as the enemy as sacrificing Iranian lives to defend Bashar Al Assad in Syria, for example, spending money to blow up ships in the Persian Gulf, or give Houthis missiles to fire in Saudi Arabia, instead of providing, you know, food and medicine for the people of Iran.</p><p>So the people of Iran, I think, would love -- would love it you know, to show the Mullahs the back door. But, you know, unfortunately, and this is what people need to remember, Iran is a police state of the first order. This is not a place where -- this is a place where the secret services are in total control and the religious extremists are in total control. It makes Iran under the Shah or Germany under Stasi, East Germany under Stasi look like a walk in the park.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's complicated. Ambassador, always fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us with your perspective. Ambassador Adam Ereli there. All right. We're going to take a quick break here. But coming up, breaking up is hard to do. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, our exclusive interview where he talks possible antitrust action and the breakup of big tech. That's coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:45:10] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai says he's not surprised by the news of possible U.S. antitrust regulation, and also responded to growing calls to break up big tech. He spoke exclusively to our Poppy Harlow. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: There's reporting that the D.O.J. is laying the foundation for a possible antitrust investigation into Google. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: No, we have always felt as a large company, we have gone through similar, you know, scrutiny in other countries, including in the U.S. before.</p><p>You know, I think it's perfectly fine that, you know, as companies get to big scale, there is scrutiny. Scale does offer many benefits. It's important to understand that. As a company, we now invest sometimes thinking five to ten years ahead without massively worrying about short term profits.</p><p>And if you -- if you think about how technology leadership directly contributes to leadership in a global economic scale, big companies are what -- who are investing in tech colleges like AI the most.</p><p>So there are many benefits, taking a long term view, you know, driving long term development, which big companies can do. But I think it's important to make sure that we are also able to create a healthy competitive ecosystem in which other companies are able to emerge.</p><p>And you know -- and that's the important question, you know, and I think scrutiny is right. And, you know, we will participate constructively in these discussions.</p><p>HARLOW: Did you expect it to come, Sundar? Or were you surprised by this news?</p><p>PICHAI: Maybe the specific timing of it. But you know, we had always expected, you know, we have gone through similar situations in Europe. And so it's not a surprise to us.</p><p>HARLOW: Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has also launched this top to bottom antitrust investigation into you and your competitors, the whole tech industry, all the big tech. And I'm interested, if that has changed any action you take within Google? Meaning has it changed what you and the Board are talking about? Has it made you rethink potential acquisitions for anything that may look anti-competitive?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, for Google, the scrutiny has been there for a while now. So we've always taken that into account. There have been times when we've looked at some acquisitions and said, \"Look, this is not, you know, something that may be possible.\" And so we've always taken that into consideration.</p><p>HARLOW: Because of this concern.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes, potentially, you know, making sure there's not too much concentration in a sector or so on. So-- but I think for some of the other companies, maybe the scrutiny is newer, but for us, you know, we've had this for a while.</p><p>HARLOW: You're used to it.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: As you may have heard, some 2020 contenders and lawmakers think you guys and all your competitors are way too big. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 contender has even put a billboard in San Francisco talking about breaking up big tech. And she says that Google and its competitors are in her words, they have too much power. She says, you hurt small business and stifle innovation. Is she right?</p><p>PICHAI: I mean, you have to look at the actual facts. And we, first of all, as a company, we do many things. Some areas, we are upstarts. We are challenging other established companies. And so if you look across the breadth of what we do, you know, you look at every area. You look at whether there's other competition and the users have choices.</p><p>And above all, are we doing well, because we are executing well as a company or you know, and doing the right things and doing well or not. And so, you know, the details end up mattering.</p><p>And you know, so, I also think it's important that when we look at it globally, our tech companies are going to contribute to our economic growth in an important way. And we compete against other countries, other companies. And so I think it's important to keep that in mind as well.</p><p>HARLOW: It sounds like you think she's wrong.</p><p>PICHAI: I think there needs to be healthy debate, you know. Any campaign has, you know moments around that. But what matters to me is the healthy, thoughtful conversations around it.</p><p>HARLOW: Your argument about other countries and America's competitiveness is similar to an argument Mark Zuckerberg has made basically, we're going to do it or China is going do it. Is that essentially what you're saying? Don't stifle this growth in America or it will go elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: You know, it could you know, when being in Silicon Valley, for example, I always think, I mean, you can't take for granted that you will always be successful. I think you have to own it. You know, now there are many countries around the world, which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley, and they are supporting their companies, too.</p><p>So we have to balance both. This doesn't mean you don't scrutinize large companies, but you have to balance it with the fact that you want big successful companies as well.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, to that point, I mean, I know that you view Google as more than an American company, you view it as a global company. So are you essentially saying, look, look at us, you've even asked for regulation for rules of the road, but if we are too squeezed or broken apart, we won't hesitate to build more elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: It's basically -- I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences. If you take a technology like artificial intelligence, you know, it will have implications for our national security.</p><p>[09:50:10] PICHAI: And you know and how we offer you know, other important areas of society.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The Google CEO, Sundar Pichai there. All right, we're going to take a break. But coming up next, they didn't get to vote until 1971, now, they're demanding equal pay and they're tired of waiting. As the women are Switzerland's take to the streets, we'll to live to Zurich. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show and a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Huawei says that will launch its foldable phone, the Mate X in September. The phone was reportedly set to launch in June, but was delayed after users faced issues with Samsung's Galaxy fold earlier this year. Not the only reason, I imagine.</p><p>NASA says it will need $20 billion to $30 billion over the next five years for its ambitious moon project. The legendary Apollo mission cost around $25 billion back in 1960. That will be the equivalent to $150 billion today.</p><p>NASA plans to send two astronauts including the first woman to walk on the moon by 2024.</p><p>Women across Switzerland walking off the job today and onto the streets demanding equal pay. They're also urging zero tolerance of violence against women and they seem to have some support from Swiss residents.</p><p>Almost 64 percent say they back today's strike. CNN's Switzerland Hannah Wise is live from Zurich, a pivotal moment 28 years since 500,000 women took to the streets. Talk to me about how things have improved and why they're still protesting today.</p><p>HANNAH WISE, CNN SWITZERLAND ANCHOR: Okay, well, if you speak to the people on the streets, they will tell you that things really just haven't moved fast enough. Because yes, on one hand regulation has improved very much. We signed it into the Constitution, gender equality back in 1981.</p><p>And even just last year, we even had Pay Parity Law put into force for some companies, but in tangible effects, in real life, people are not seeing changes.</p><p>If you look at the women's salaries here in Switzerland, they're on average, around 20 percent less than their male counterparts. And of course, that goes much further than just the monthly paycheck. You've got the pension pause, down 37 percent on their male counterparts because women are taking time off to look after children.</p><p>And of course, there's bonuses as well, you may remember UBS, Switzerland's first bank, and of course, a cornerstone of the financial industry, just a few months ago, they were back in the papers because women were claiming that their bonuses were cut while they were on maternity leave and some woman even resigned on that.</p><p>So while there is change on the regulation side, it's just not happening fast enough in real life. And I think a really good statistic to illustrate this is from the World Economic Forum last year, which is of course held here in Switzerland on gender pay.</p><p>[09:55:11] WISE: They say that women to earn the same as men, it would take 180 years for that to happen. So over a century for women in Switzerland to earn the same as their male counterparts.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, proud of them. Get out there on the streets, and it's nice to see widespread support as well. Hannah, fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us from CNN Switzerland there, Hannah Wise.</p><p>All right. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing as we get kicking and get started on this session right now. We are some six tenth of a percent lower for the NASDAQ. As you can see the chip stocks right now front and center. That warning from Broadcom not only about the broader trade concerns, of course, but the fallout, the impact from the restrictions on China's Huawei feeding into these numbers.</p><p>Also, the S&amp;P off some four tenths of one percent. We'll be back in a couple of hours' time to keep you abreast of all these stories. But for now, that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Have a great weekend.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061401cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBN-V6R1-JB20-G1YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 14, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002GD1</classCode><className>BROADCOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran written all over it. President Trump's take on the tanker attacks yesterday. The chips are down. Broadcom's forecasts send a trade war warning. And the Swiss strike back. Women across Switzerland walking out of work, calling for greater quality. It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Happy Friday and a Happy Friday for stock investors. Again, we are just two percent away from record highs. I'll be asking throughout the show, is that justified? Ultimately, as I walk you through the fallout from the tensions in the Middle East and what we saw yesterday with the tanker attacks, but also some pretty concerning data from around the world, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now U.S. futures, a little bit softer. We did manage half a percent gains yesterday despite these tensions that I mentioned. The energy sector of course, performing well.</p><p>Today though, it's all about the tech sector especially the chip stocks. Broadcom dashing hopes of a business pick up later this year. The trade war, Huawei, you mentioned it, we've got all the details for you in a second.</p><p>Everywhere you look though, I'm seeing signs of broader concerns, the weight of the trade war of filtering in here. China, retail sales numbers there held up pretty well, I have to say that the industrial output numbers, those growing at the weakest pace in 17 years.</p><p>The U.S. version is out in 15 minutes, so we'll be all over that. But for now, we did see a solid retail sales numbers in line with estimates. The U.S. consumer remains resilient. But hey, before we get too excited, compare and contrast Morgan Stanley's U.S. business conditions index has just had the biggest monthly drop on record. Fine. It's just one month and we did see a pullback in the stock markets in May of course, too.</p><p>But now more than 600 U.S. firms warning the U.S. government about further Chinese tariffs. We'll talk about that, too. But all sorts of signs here and warnings don't do more. Please, the U.S. government.</p><p>What's going on in the energy sector? A U.S. oil prices study today after that four percent rise that we saw yesterday after the twin tanker attacks. The U.S. firmly blaming Iran and tensions, of course not easing there. But you have to argue here the dominant driver for prices is bumpy U.S. supply and demand fears.</p><p>Let's break this down. Get to the drivers. Iran has said the U.S. government's tanker accusations are quote \"sad, and a suspicious act\" while the U.S. says this footage shows the Iranian Navy removing an unexploded mine from one of those crippled tankers.</p><p>Donald Trump just told Fox News that the incident had Iran written all over it. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, Iran did do it, and you know, they did it because you saw the boat. I guess one of the mines didn't explode, and it probably got essentially Iran written all over it.</p><p>And you saw the boat at night trying to take the mine off and successfully took the mine off the boat, and that was exposed and that was a boat that was them. And they didn't want the evidence left behind. I guess they don't know that we have things that we can detect in the dark that worked very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we've got John Defterios for us in Abu Dhabi, Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran. First to Fred, I'm going to come to you first. Extraordinarily quick to accuse the Iranians here whether it was Mike Pompeo, of course, and the President this morning.</p><p>But talk us through this video as well, and the evidence perhaps that provides.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're absolutely right, Julia and the Iranians really aren't very happy about the fact that the U.S. was very quick to point the finger at Tehran. First of all, of course, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and then what we've just seen now, President Trump essentially saying the same thing.</p><p>Now according to the U.S. Military, what's going on in that video the U.S. says is that this was taken a long time after that attack initially took place. The U.S. said it already had a ship in the area, but that little patrol boat from the Iranians then came up to one of those stricken tankers, came up to the side.</p><p>And that essentially the U.S. says, the crew of that Iranian patrol boat then took an object off the side of that tanker which the U.S. believes may have been an unexploded sea mine. And it was therefore trying to get rid of some of the evidence the U.S. believes against Iran.</p><p>Now the Iranians, of course, having none of that saying that these are false accusations that are being levied by the United States. There's one senior Iranian lawmaker who came out and essentially says the main suspects in all of this are the U.S. Intelligence services and the Israelis.</p><p>[09:05:08] PLEITGEN: Obviously also not to offer any sort of evidence to back that up. But you can really feel how the rhetoric certainly isn't being toned down in any way, shape or form, Julia. In fact, it is indeed being heated up.</p><p>On the one hand, you have President Trump and his accusations that we heard just there and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. On the other hand, you have the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who just a few minutes ago, he's at an economic forum right now tweeted the following saying that \"Unilateral U.S. actions, including its economic terrorism on Iran are solely responsible for insecurity and renewed tensions in our region.\"</p><p>So the Iranians not only saying they didn't do it, but they're the ones who are saying that the U.S. is the one that's fueling and fanning the flames in the greater Middle Eastern region -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the Foreign Minister said it was war mongering, the accusations from the United States here. I mean, I think everybody here is wondering what now? We've seen a ratcheting up of the tensions, the accusations from the United States on Iran. They're accusing the U.S. of economic terrorism here, what now?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, the big question is, are these two sides able to walk this back right now? Is there going to be some sort of way to move forward to try and essentially prevent this from escalating any further?</p><p>Certainly right now, what the U.S. is saying is that all this is being investigated that apparently, authorities are out there at those two tanker boats, and trying to see what exactly happened there.</p><p>But the U.S., of course, has now already laid the finger of blame at the Iranians. And if we look at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's press conference yesterday, he wasn't just saying that. He was also saying the other tanker attacks were also done by Iran. He was accusing the Iranians of an attack on a pipeline in Saudi Arabia, its allies, the Houthis coming from Yemen.</p><p>So also laying the finger of blame at the Iranians for a lot of things that are going on in the greater Middle Eastern region, and essentially accusing them of destabilizing the region.</p><p>Now, of course, as you can imagine, the Iranians, for their part are not happy about that at all. And if you look at yesterday, when the Supreme Leader of Iran met with Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, he said, \"Look, it's not even worth negotiating with someone like President Trump.\"</p><p>He said he wouldn't even give President Trump an answer when President Trump wanted those negotiator trying to start those negotiations with the Iranians. So right now, it's going to be very, very difficult to try and prevent this from escalating any further -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that is quite fascinating to me all, the reaction that we saw in the oil markets yesterday. And, John, the lack of reaction that we're seeing today, despite what is an escalation of tensions here and to Fred's point, too similar to our reporting events within a month. JD, what do you make of it? There's clearly other dominant factors here for investors that are weighing on oil prices.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's extraordinary because we're in a risk on environment, as we were talking about here.</p><p>You've had the tanker attacks, an attack against a pumping station for Saudi Aramco, even an airport in Saudi Arabia and it's just barely moving the needle. But I think the three key factors at play here that are impacting prices. First and foremost, the U.S. trade sanctions whether against China, Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, or the threats against Mexico, it's hitting demand.</p><p>The International Energy Agency put out its latest report saying the daily demand growth is now down to just 1.2 million barrels a day; sharply lower than last year. U.S. production is surging, Julia.</p><p>The expectation is between 2018 and by the end of this year, the U.S. is going to add 3.5 million barrels a day. It's like adding another UAE to the energy market, and it's a major OPEC producer.</p><p>And finally, we see that the call on OPEC production right now is at the lowest level since 2014. It's below 30 million barrels a day.</p><p>So the U.S. is rising, it is forcing OPEC to cut back. Iran, Venezuela, Libya all see the production lower. At the end of the day, the two key players in the OPEC, non-OPEC stratosphere right now. Saudi Arabia and Russia are looking at the five year moving average. Because of the uncertainty of the economy right now, inventories are growing. So this is going to put pressure on them at their next meeting in Vienna, not to release more oil onto the market, and perhaps make a deeper cut.</p><p>This will be an interesting meeting, because they have Iran and Venezuela at the table with U.S. sanctions hammering away at those two countries, with the U.S., Saudi Arabia and UAE partners here with the pressure on against Iran.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And we're talking nonstop about the back and forth between the United States and the Iranians here. But there are other countries involved, particularly in the region right now, John, what are they saying about the situation just keeping a little bit quiet here?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, they don't like the idea that we could stumble into war. This is the definition here constantly. So we have this access of power against Iran. I would include Israel in the mix, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt.</p><p>And this could be something that could trigger something much worse than the oil markets, if it spirals out of control. You know, it's interesting because I've been in this oil market for 25 years. You go back to the Gulf War, for example, the Iran-Iraq War, the invasion of Iraq, even the removal of Colonel Qaddafi.</p><p>[09:10:17] DEFTERIOS: Julia, we'd see spikes 10 to 15 percent, with anything around the Strait of Hormuz. And right now we saw a blip going up four and a half percent losing the gains entirely. And we have to take a step back, we're in a bear market since the end of April, we've lost $15.00 or about 20 percent, whether it's WTI or North Sea Brent.</p><p>There's just too much oil around and the United States is going to go past 13 million barrels a day, while President Trump's pressure on sanctions is slowing down global growth. That's the reality of why the markets not reacting to the pressure we have in this region.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a negative sentiment tranquilizer on steroids. John Defterios, thank you so much for that. And Fred, of course, over in Tehran for us, too.</p><p>All right. Let's move on to our second drive. Of course, the Iranian situation not the only foreign policy challenge that the United States is facing. China, too. Six hundred firms here in the United States warning President Trump and the administration about the risks of further tariffs on the Chinese.</p><p>They say more times will cost U.S. jobs and harm millions of American consumers. Clare Sebastian has the story for us, and it's not just the ordinary U.S. firms. I mean, these are giants -- Walmart, Costco -- urging the President to remove tariffs and not to add further, Clare. Tell us more.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this reads Julia like a who's who of the biggest retailers in the U.S. Walmart, Target, Costco, as you say the likes of, Footlocker, Levi Strauss, Macy's as well. These are, you know, some huge employers.</p><p>Walmart employs 1.5 million people in the U.S. It's the biggest private sector employer and you can bet if they are threatening to raise prices. The many, many smaller companies on the list are doing it as well.</p><p>There's a lot of pressure on these companies and actually, Julia, I spoke to one of these smaller companies this week, a bike and bicycle pot wholesaler called Kent International. And their President explained to me how the pressure on the company is increasing. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD, KAMLER, PRESIDENT, KENT INTERNATIONAL: We had to raise prices immediately. But our customers have policies where they don't accept price increases right away. And so in the time gap, which was about 75 days, we had literally one and a half to two months of time when we were paying these additional tariffs and yet we couldn't pass it on. So we suffered quite a bit of losses during that period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: He says he lost about $3.5 million. He also said that ocean freight costs rose in that time because many people were rushing to get their products to the U.S. before the tariff increases came in.</p><p>But Julia, so far with the $200 billion in tariffs that have been hit, consumer goods have been broadly insulated. If another $300 billion gets hit by tariffs, you can bet this will be a direct hit to consumer products. And that's why we see so many retailers so worried.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and they can't substitute quick enough. I mean, we're talking of price increases of some 16 percent, so they were saying.</p><p>Yes, we'll see what the response is. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, next driver. The chip maker, Broadcom down some nine percent premarket. They lowered their full-year outlook warning of a demand slowdown due to the trade will impact and of course, the direct response at the ban on Huawei, of course on their technology.</p><p>Matt Egan joins me now. Matt, a blow for the entire industry here, I think, because everyone was hoping that we'd see a bit of a pickup in the second half of this year and Broadcom saying, \"not happening.\"</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right, Julia, not happening. It's clear that the chip makers are getting hit by a one two punch here of the trade war with China and a global slowdown in growth and Broadcom cited both factors in dramatically lowering its revenue forecast for the rest of the year by about $2 billion.</p><p>The company also pointed to the U.S. export ban on Huawei, which accounted for nearly a billion dollars in direct revenue for Broadcom last year.</p><p>Now Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, he said that he is seeing a -- he said that the environment is very, very nervous. And he's saying that he is seeing a very rapid and sharp contraction in orders.</p><p>Now, those are pretty stark words from a major CEO and Hock Tan did not shy away from blaming the trade war specifically. He said that it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty.</p><p>Now that gloomy sentiment from Broadcom has further dashed those hopes of a second half turnaround in the chip industry. We've seen AMD and Micron and Qualcomm and NVIDIA, Intel all move down premarket.</p><p>Apple which relies on Broadcom chips for some of its products is also set to open down last check about one percent. Now, Julia, I think all this bears watching because the chip industry is looked at as an economic bellwether and just yesterday, billionaire investor Jeff Gundlach said he does think there's something to this idea that the trade war is contributing to a global slowdown.</p><p>[09:15:13] EGAN: And he thinks there's a 40 to 45 percent chance of a U.S. recession within six months.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. I mean, he tends to be a bear. I guess we counter it slightly with that. But when you're talking about a company like Huawei that outsells Apple, in terms of smartphones, and the supply chain is so huge as far as network equipment is concerned, you kind of have to see a reaction more broadly than just initial sales like we see the chips. It's a great point. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. President Trump appears to be backtracking from his statement that he would accept foreign dirt on his opponents.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News, the President said there's nothing wrong with accepting the information. However, he would turn it over to the F.B.I.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via phone): I don't think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody's going to present me with anything.</p><p>But number two, if I was and of course, you have to look at it. Because if you don't look at it, you're not going to know if it's bad. How are you going to know if it's bad, but of course you give it to the FBI or report it to the Attorney General or somebody like that.</p><p>But of course you do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: President Trump also declined to offer any new details on whether China's President Xi plans to meet with him at the upcoming G20 Summit.</p><p>Female lawmakers in Kenya stormed out of a Parliament in protest after a male member of Parliament allegedly assaulted a female lawmaker.</p><p>MP Fatima Gedi, who you see here says Rashid Kassim punched her several times in the mouth and jaw after confronting her over a budget issue on Thursday. He is now being arrested.</p><p>All right, still to come here on FIRST MOVE. Oil on troubled waters as tensions rise over attacks on tankers and the Gulf of Oman. We seek to a former Ambassador who says the U.S. should fight fire with fire.</p><p>And breaking up is hard to do. The CEO of Google pushes back against moves to cut his company into smaller pieces. Our exclusive interview coming up. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:20:24] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We're looking at a lower open for stock markets. All the focus on the tech sector. In particular this morning, in light of what we've been talking about, chip maker Broadcom's warning and fears that the second half bounce for the chip stocks won't happen.</p><p>Some perspective here is important though, too. That Semi-Conductor Conductor Index is still up some 20 percent here today, even as it's down 12 percent from the April highs that we saw.</p><p>We are still on track more broadly for a second straight week of gains here, but continue to watch the signs in the bond market. That 10-year treasury yield sitting around 2.1 percent on broader growth. That said, we have to point out that the economic numbers today were good.</p><p>Industrial production numbers just out, up better than expected to 0.4 percent in May following solid retail sales numbers for May out earlier, too.</p><p>Let's talk all this through. Jonathan Golub is Managing Director and Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Credit Suisse, and he joins us now. Great to have you with us.</p><p>JONATHAN GOLUB, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE: Good morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about retail sales. Solid number here. The consumer holding up pretty well in the face of border uncertainty.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, but the key for the consumer is that jobs are abundant, the unemployment rate is low. So if you lose your job, it's very easy to get one and you're getting a raise. So the consumers are in great shape. The cyclical data, especially on the industrial side, and I know the industrial productions a little better today, but it's been sloppy, really for the last year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It has. And we saw yesterday and I mentioned it earlier on the show, actually Morgan Stanley's Business Conditions Index was splashed all over the financial news and websites over the last 24 hours as a warning for May.</p><p>How closely should we be following things like that and the business surveys at this stage, which are showing kind of conditions, the market selloff in May? The broader trade tension?</p><p>GOLUB: It's the most important question, because if you look at what the surveys, they tell you what businesses intend to do and a funny thing, when they say they intend to cut back, they tend to actually do that.</p><p>If you look at what they call the hard data, which is the actual production itself, it tends to be a little bit more lagging. So we're very focused on this survey data that you're talking about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And it brings it back again to trade war concerns and the level of uncertainty that we continue to have hear, whether we're going to see more tariffs on China or a deal fundamentally reached. It's tough for businesses to make decisions.</p><p>GOLUB: I think there's two issues. First, if we step back and said there was nothing going on with trade whatsoever, we've seen a weakening of this industrial type activity now for quite a while.</p><p>So I think that the most important thing is to separate this out as we were seeing a deceleration regardless. But yes, if businesses are making a long-term decision, if I want to relocate my factory or retool a plant or initiate a new project, very, very difficult for businesses to do that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. So the Fed.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It has to work out how it's going to message to the market here. The consumer, the retail sales is holding up, as you said, even if we strip out the trade war impact on the economy, the underlying economy was weakening. How do you justify potential rate cuts in the face of sort of mixed messages here as far as the economy is concerned.</p><p>GOLUB: The Fed is all about interest rates, and right now, the yield curve is steeply inverted at the short-end of the curve. And putting in simpler terms, the short rate is just too high compared to the general level of rates for the rest of the market. And the market is bullying the Fed to lower rates.</p><p>If we didn't have a trade issue, the Fed would still have to lower rates. Why? Inflation expectations are super low. Interest rates are falling now, about 120 basis points, 1.2 percent since November.</p><p>The market is telling you that rates are too high and again, is trade part of it? Yes. But it's not the only story.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: See that's a fascinating point to me. So arguably, the fact can say that, look, we're looking at inflation at this moment. We're looking at the data. That's what we do. That's our job. There is uncertainties out there. But you know, we need to get some easing.</p><p>GOLUB: The reason I'm smiling is that what the Fed really should be saying is, is that we're -- that they're off sides, that they tighten too much and they need to pull back. They're not going to say that they made a mistake, which is probably the case. What they're going to say is \"Oh, we're using this as an insurance policy.\"</p><p>The market is going to look right through that and realize that in fact, they are easing because the rate is too high.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, I call it the Fed pirouette. We've seen one pivot, make sure it keeps spinning basically, if they've wrecked the cake, how many times will they cut this year then?</p><p>GOLUB: Our view is that they cut once this year, but the market is saying and it's what's important, the market thinks if they cut three times this year and one time, so the fact the market thinks that they have to cut 100 basis points, one percent, it really means that the market believes the Fed is off side and needs to take action.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so when I started the show today, I said should we be two percent away from record highs more broadly in the U.S. stock market? And some of the justification I get is that rates have come down and that support stocks.</p><p>[09:25:27] GOLUB: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've done some analysis on this, on the relationship between lower rates here and the performance of stocks. So two questions there.</p><p>GOLUB: Okay, so there's again -- is this a short term or long term?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: In the short run, when rates are falling, it's a signal that something is broken, and so by rates going down this much in the last five months, it's really telling you that the economy is taking on more -- under more pressure than we think. And it and it is stressed that way.</p><p>And so we've kind of -- and we've been really bullish for the last five years. This is the first time we're saying, you know what? Maybe now is not the time to jump in and buy every dip. Longer term, the real key here is the companies are responding. They are doing a great job of managing costs. They're returning dividends back to shareholders very high. We like U.S. stocks longer term, but the near term, a little more spicy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So be careful in the near term.</p><p>GOLUB: If you had a two or three year horizon, I'm absolutely a buyer. Would I be jumping in this morning? I'm not sure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's my response. Jonathan, thank you so much. Obviously popular on the floor as well, sir. Thank you so much. Great to have you here.</p><p>GOLUB: Good to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy Friday. All right. We're counting down to the market open this morning. As you can see, Chewy actually is listing today, so no animals around, but lots of cute pictures. We'll see how that performs when it opens up later today, but plenty more to discuss to on the show. Stay with us. The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:01] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley from the New York Stock Exchange here. That was the opening bell on Wall Street where pet food and supply company, Chewy is going public today.</p><p>Chewy is the internet arm of retailer Pet Smart. Share prices actually priced at $22.00 a share, so that's above the target range. They've raised around $1 billion. It's another example of how the pet business has become a pretty big business. And there was a very cute dog on the balcony I saw there.</p><p>Now, forget the fun, but it's going to be a bit of a rough start. Yes, sorry. They didn't write that out on Wall Street. In more ways than one, as you can see stocks losing a bit of ground here. The biggest drop for the NASDAQ, some four tenths of one percent. Weak Chinese factory data and of course, poor results from chip maker Broadcom as we've been discussing weighing on sentiment.</p><p>Though there is the bright side here. The industrial production numbers that we just got from the United States came in above expectations. U.S. retail sales also, those numbers coming in pretty solidly, too.</p><p>All right let me walk you through our global movers. Broadcom, let's take a look at how that's been going well. Bouncing seven and a half percent. The chip maker revenues missed expectations. It lowered his full-year revenue guidance, too. They blamed the demand slow down on the trade tensions between the United States and China and of course, Huawei's export restrictions, too.</p><p>We're seeing the broader sector under a bit of pressure as a result of that, too, and in the European session, in fact.</p><p>Facebook higher by 1.7 percent. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the social network's new cryptocurrency will be called Libra, and it's getting backing from more than a dozen companies including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Uber. The digital coin will be unveiled next week, and it's set to launch next year.</p><p>Blue Apron, down nine and a half percent in the session. Ouch. The misery continues for the meal kit company. The board approved a one for 15 reversed stock split that goes into effect after Friday's market close.</p><p>It's now trading as you can see it just over 59 cents a share. Ouch. All right, let's move on. The controversy over attacks on oil tankers maybe heating up, but as you can see the energy market's reaction is looking a lot cooler today. Investors shrugging off the floor its trading as you can see just higher by some six tenths of one percent for Brent, twelve tenths of 1 percent higher for WTI.</p><p>This is the video that's ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. said it shows an Iranian naval vessel coming up alongside one of the tankers, a Japanese ship in fact, and removing an unexploded mine. U.S. officials believe Tehran was trying to get rid of the evidence.</p><p>Our next guest wrote recently that the United States should take an eye for an eye approach with the Iranian leadership. If they attack an Emirati ship, we should attack an Iranian ship. That's a quote. And that's the only language the Iranian leadership understands.</p><p>Adam Ereli is a former U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain. He also served as Deputy State Department spokesperson, and he joins us now from Washington. Ambassador, that's a pretty punchy response. Would you argue that if indeed, Iran is responsible for this latest attack, it's a direct result of a lack of action from the events that we saw less than a month ago?</p><p>ADAM ERELI, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO BAHRAIN: Short answer is yes. And yes, I don't think there's any question and I don't think the question is if Iran is responsible. You know, there are those who -- I mean, Iran is denying. There's no reason to believe them. There are others who think this might be a false flag operation. That's patently ridiculous.</p><p>Number three, you know, everybody is looking at these latest events as if they are some one-off. But we have a pattern of behavior by Iran over the past 40 years since 1979, when the revolution came to power of attacking American and American targets, and those of its allies. And there's never been a response by the United States.</p><p>So my point is simply this. Iran will continue to test us and see how far it can go. Unless there's a brush back from us, unless they're forced to pay a price. Until now that hasn't happened, and as a result, we've seen a pattern of aggressive actions, not only in the last several months, but over the last 40 years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Some people would look at what you're saying here and go, \"Hang on a second. Why is it the United States' responsibility to respond if they are Iranians attack an Emirati ship or a Saudi ship?\" Isn't it a responsibility of other nations in that region to respond, too and not just leave it to the United States to take care of military action here, because that's what we're arguing?</p><p>[09:35:13] ERELI: Well, I would qualify that. First of all, the United States is a superpower, we ought to act like one. We're the only country with the capability to attack quickly, precisely, and effectively. No other country in the world has that. So that's point one.</p><p>Point two, we have made a commitment to secure freedom of navigation in this part of the world. That is a commitment we need to stand by, or our word means nothing.</p><p>Finally, number three, just because Saudi Arabia and Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates aren't pulling the trigger, they are providing significant and I mean, significant logistical, material, political support for U.S. forces. We operate as a coalition, and this would not be the United States going it alone.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why isn't President Trump acting here? In the article that you wrote, you said, \"Look, he's afraid that it will costing votes in 2020.\" Explain?</p><p>ERELI: Well, two points. You know, Trump is nothing if not consistent, right? I mean, he might seem to be a loose cannon and a wild card. But if you actually look carefully at what he said, and what he's done, there is a method to the apparent madness.</p><p>Number one, he said he wants to -- he doesn't want to get America involved in any wars, and he wants to get America out of the wars that it's in.</p><p>So in Afghanistan and Syria, he has been very aggressive about pulling us out. The only reason a small number of American troops remain there is because his military advisers convinced him that it was necessary to do.</p><p>He is not going to get into another -- he doesn't want to get into another conflict with Iran.</p><p>Now, my point is, this isn't a question of full scale war or peace, you can -- you can take limited surgical strikes against Iranian targets without going to a full scale war.</p><p>But the final point is this. Trump doesn't want the price of oil to go up because that hurts the U.S. economy. That's been a bedrock of his foreign policy with Saudi Arabia and others, keep the price moderate, number one. Number two, he doesn't want to lose votes in 2020.</p><p>His eye is on November 2020 and all of his decision making is with that in mind.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think in any kind of relationship, and you can educate me better on this, Ambassador, you have to have an end game. You have to know what your end game is. Is it bringing Iran around the table for negotiations? Because I wonder how the attack for the attack and the eye for an eye achieves that? Because at this moment, we see the United States very quick to point the finger at Iran, whether that's right or wrong. I just don't see an exit.</p><p>I don't see the ability for Iran here or an opportunity for them to be able to back down and negotiate because that will look like weakness here, too.</p><p>ERELI: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's the endgame here?</p><p>ERELI: Well, it depends who you ask and when. But, the administration says the end game is very simple. It's to have Iran be a responsible member of the international community, to abandon its nuclear program, abandon its support for terrorism. And live in peace with its neighbors. All right, that's the endgame.</p><p>Now they've chosen a number of tactics to achieve that. Number one, they've imposed a brutal sanctions regime on the government of Iran in order to deny the resources it uses to fund terror. Second, it has opened the door to negotiations saying our goal of negotiation is not just the nuclear program, but all your troublesome behavior.</p><p>To think that Iran is going to do that is crazy in my view, but at least we're trying. Number three, and this is where I get to the use of military force. Deterrence is an important part of that strategy. Yes, you can have negotiations; yes, you can have a path forward. But if Iran tests us, if Iran challenges us, if Iran tries to intimidate us and our allies, and threaten international peace and security by bombing oil tankers in the part of the world where 30 percent of seaborne oil exports or oil trade goes through, then we have to act.</p><p>We can't be -- how should I put it? We can't be afraid of taking decisive action in defense of our interests when those interests are challenged, and Iran is doing just that. And we're staying quiet and holding our powder, keeping our powder dry. I don't know why.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ambassador, very quickly, what do the Iranian people want here?</p><p>ERELI: Well, I think what the Iranian people want is clear. And they've been saying that in a very loud and clear voice since December of 2017. We're talking about really almost 18 months.</p><p>[09:40:07] ERELI: They have been in the streets, interestingly saying that they have lost faith in the Islamic Revolution, which brought the current regime to power in 1979.</p><p>Never before have Iranian protester said, we don't believe in the Revolution, we don't believe in the Supreme Leader, we don't believe in our leadership. The game is over is quote what they say, \"Death to Rouhani. Death to the dictator.\"</p><p>So the Iranian people, you know, the they don't see the United States as the enemy. They see their own leadership as the enemy as sacrificing Iranian lives to defend Bashar Al Assad in Syria, for example, spending money to blow up ships in the Persian Gulf, or give Houthis missiles to fire in Saudi Arabia, instead of providing, you know, food and medicine for the people of Iran.</p><p>So the people of Iran, I think, would love -- would love it you know, to show the Mullahs the back door. But, you know, unfortunately, and this is what people need to remember, Iran is a police state of the first order. This is not a place where -- this is a place where the secret services are in total control and the religious extremists are in total control. It makes Iran under the Shah or Germany under Stasi, East Germany under Stasi look like a walk in the park.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's complicated. Ambassador, always fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us with your perspective. Ambassador Adam Ereli there. All right. We're going to take a quick break here. But coming up, breaking up is hard to do. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, our exclusive interview where he talks possible antitrust action and the breakup of big tech. That's coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:45:10] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai says he's not surprised by the news of possible U.S. antitrust regulation, and also responded to growing calls to break up big tech. He spoke exclusively to our Poppy Harlow. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: There's reporting that the D.O.J. is laying the foundation for a possible antitrust investigation into Google. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: No, we have always felt as a large company, we have gone through similar, you know, scrutiny in other countries, including in the U.S. before.</p><p>You know, I think it's perfectly fine that, you know, as companies get to big scale, there is scrutiny. Scale does offer many benefits. It's important to understand that. As a company, we now invest sometimes thinking five to ten years ahead without massively worrying about short term profits.</p><p>And if you -- if you think about how technology leadership directly contributes to leadership in a global economic scale, big companies are what -- who are investing in tech colleges like AI the most.</p><p>So there are many benefits, taking a long term view, you know, driving long term development, which big companies can do. But I think it's important to make sure that we are also able to create a healthy competitive ecosystem in which other companies are able to emerge.</p><p>And you know -- and that's the important question, you know, and I think scrutiny is right. And, you know, we will participate constructively in these discussions.</p><p>HARLOW: Did you expect it to come, Sundar? Or were you surprised by this news?</p><p>PICHAI: Maybe the specific timing of it. But you know, we had always expected, you know, we have gone through similar situations in Europe. And so it's not a surprise to us.</p><p>HARLOW: Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has also launched this top to bottom antitrust investigation into you and your competitors, the whole tech industry, all the big tech. And I'm interested, if that has changed any action you take within Google? Meaning has it changed what you and the Board are talking about? Has it made you rethink potential acquisitions for anything that may look anti-competitive?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, for Google, the scrutiny has been there for a while now. So we've always taken that into account. There have been times when we've looked at some acquisitions and said, \"Look, this is not, you know, something that may be possible.\" And so we've always taken that into consideration.</p><p>HARLOW: Because of this concern.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes, potentially, you know, making sure there's not too much concentration in a sector or so on. So-- but I think for some of the other companies, maybe the scrutiny is newer, but for us, you know, we've had this for a while.</p><p>HARLOW: You're used to it.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: As you may have heard, some 2020 contenders and lawmakers think you guys and all your competitors are way too big. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 contender has even put a billboard in San Francisco talking about breaking up big tech. And she says that Google and its competitors are in her words, they have too much power. She says, you hurt small business and stifle innovation. Is she right?</p><p>PICHAI: I mean, you have to look at the actual facts. And we, first of all, as a company, we do many things. Some areas, we are upstarts. We are challenging other established companies. And so if you look across the breadth of what we do, you know, you look at every area. You look at whether there's other competition and the users have choices.</p><p>And above all, are we doing well, because we are executing well as a company or you know, and doing the right things and doing well or not. And so, you know, the details end up mattering.</p><p>And you know, so, I also think it's important that when we look at it globally, our tech companies are going to contribute to our economic growth in an important way. And we compete against other countries, other companies. And so I think it's important to keep that in mind as well.</p><p>HARLOW: It sounds like you think she's wrong.</p><p>PICHAI: I think there needs to be healthy debate, you know. Any campaign has, you know moments around that. But what matters to me is the healthy, thoughtful conversations around it.</p><p>HARLOW: Your argument about other countries and America's competitiveness is similar to an argument Mark Zuckerberg has made basically, we're going to do it or China is going do it. Is that essentially what you're saying? Don't stifle this growth in America or it will go elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: You know, it could you know, when being in Silicon Valley, for example, I always think, I mean, you can't take for granted that you will always be successful. I think you have to own it. You know, now there are many countries around the world, which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley, and they are supporting their companies, too.</p><p>So we have to balance both. This doesn't mean you don't scrutinize large companies, but you have to balance it with the fact that you want big successful companies as well.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, to that point, I mean, I know that you view Google as more than an American company, you view it as a global company. So are you essentially saying, look, look at us, you've even asked for regulation for rules of the road, but if we are too squeezed or broken apart, we won't hesitate to build more elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: It's basically -- I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences. If you take a technology like artificial intelligence, you know, it will have implications for our national security.</p><p>[09:50:10] PICHAI: And you know and how we offer you know, other important areas of society.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The Google CEO, Sundar Pichai there. All right, we're going to take a break. But coming up next, they didn't get to vote until 1971, now, they're demanding equal pay and they're tired of waiting. As the women are Switzerland's take to the streets, we'll to live to Zurich. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show and a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Huawei says that will launch its foldable phone, the Mate X in September. The phone was reportedly set to launch in June, but was delayed after users faced issues with Samsung's Galaxy fold earlier this year. Not the only reason, I imagine.</p><p>NASA says it will need $20 billion to $30 billion over the next five years for its ambitious moon project. The legendary Apollo mission cost around $25 billion back in 1960. That will be the equivalent to $150 billion today.</p><p>NASA plans to send two astronauts including the first woman to walk on the moon by 2024.</p><p>Women across Switzerland walking off the job today and onto the streets demanding equal pay. They're also urging zero tolerance of violence against women and they seem to have some support from Swiss residents.</p><p>Almost 64 percent say they back today's strike. CNN's Switzerland Hannah Wise is live from Zurich, a pivotal moment 28 years since 500,000 women took to the streets. Talk to me about how things have improved and why they're still protesting today.</p><p>HANNAH WISE, CNN SWITZERLAND ANCHOR: Okay, well, if you speak to the people on the streets, they will tell you that things really just haven't moved fast enough. Because yes, on one hand regulation has improved very much. We signed it into the Constitution, gender equality back in 1981.</p><p>And even just last year, we even had Pay Parity Law put into force for some companies, but in tangible effects, in real life, people are not seeing changes.</p><p>If you look at the women's salaries here in Switzerland, they're on average, around 20 percent less than their male counterparts. And of course, that goes much further than just the monthly paycheck. You've got the pension pause, down 37 percent on their male counterparts because women are taking time off to look after children.</p><p>And of course, there's bonuses as well, you may remember UBS, Switzerland's first bank, and of course, a cornerstone of the financial industry, just a few months ago, they were back in the papers because women were claiming that their bonuses were cut while they were on maternity leave and some woman even resigned on that.</p><p>So while there is change on the regulation side, it's just not happening fast enough in real life. And I think a really good statistic to illustrate this is from the World Economic Forum last year, which is of course held here in Switzerland on gender pay.</p><p>[09:55:11] WISE: They say that women to earn the same as men, it would take 180 years for that to happen. So over a century for women in Switzerland to earn the same as their male counterparts.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, proud of them. Get out there on the streets, and it's nice to see widespread support as well. Hannah, fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us from CNN Switzerland there, Hannah Wise.</p><p>All right. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing as we get kicking and get started on this session right now. We are some six tenth of a percent lower for the NASDAQ. As you can see the chip stocks right now front and center. That warning from Broadcom not only about the broader trade concerns, of course, but the fallout, the impact from the restrictions on China's Huawei feeding into these numbers.</p><p>Also, the S&amp;P off some four tenths of one percent. We'll be back in a couple of hours' time to keep you abreast of all these stories. But for now, that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Have a great weekend.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061501cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBN-5TS1-DXH2-60KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 15, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002GD1</classCode><className>BROADCOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The problem is, no one knows what exactly will happen next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just yesterday, President Trump defended his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Listen to this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">9BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They hated ISIS. So they were fighting ISIS. But we never agreed. Where is an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds? It never said that.</p><p>And we have protected them. We've taken very good care of them. And I hope they're going to watch over ISIS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Barbara Starr joins us again from the Pentagon.</p><p>So right now, at least, Barbara, the official line from leadership in Iraq is that U.S. troops cannot stay there as they head there from Syria. Esper's in the region, what does this mean?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we're looking at is several hundred U.S. troops cross the border into the relative safety of northwestern Iraq as they left Syria. This has always been the designated place that they were going to go.</p><p>The Iraqi government, putting out a statement saying that they had permission to come in, but it wants them out of there, that they simply cannot stay.</p><p>Esper, traveling in the region, the defense secretary, is expected now to talk to the Iraqis about this and try and work it out. There may be a situation here where the Iraqi government has issued this statement pretty much for domestic political consumption, that's one theory. It's always very tough for that government to be seen as just having an open door to the U.S. military.</p><p>But there's a deeper issue here. Do you still need troops in that region to -- U.S. troops to fight ISIS, to conduct surveillance, to know where ISIS is? And, in president Trump's desire to help protect the oil fields.</p><p>So even if the troops stay for a while, they will eventually come home. When they come home, a big question. What will their mission be as they are in Iraq --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>STARR: -- that's the other big question.</p><p>HARLOW: And it's an important one. Barbara, thank you so much --</p><p>STARR: Sure.</p><p>HARLOW: -- from the Pentagon for us this morning.</p><p>There is a lot going on today. Here's quick look at \"What to Watch.\"</p><p>TEXT: What to Watch... 12:15 p.m. Eastern, Larry Kudlow discusses future of infrastructure; 7:00 p.m. Eastern, V.P. Pence speaks at Heritage Foundation gala; 8:07 p.m. Eastern, First pitch of the 2019 World Series</p><p>[10:34:16]</p><p>HARLOW: Top Democrats, raising new concerns about protecting the whistleblower's identity as the president, once again, goes on the attack. The former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, is with me next to discuss.</p><p>HARLOW: The top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine is on Capitol Hill this hour, behind closed doors. He is the latest key witness to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. And this, as top Democrats raise new concerns about protecting the identity of the whistleblower, whose complaint about President Trump's Ukraine call sparked the entire impeachment inquiry.</p><p>With me now to discuss all the developments, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Good morning, Director Clapper.</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Bill Taylor, widely respected career diplomat, behind closed doors. Remember, it was he who texted this to the president's E.U. ambassador in September. Quote, \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" TEXT: Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the E.U.: Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign...</p><p>HARLOW: He was told by Sondland to call him, and we know Sondland conferred with the president over the phone about what to say in response. How big of a potential threat to the presidency is this testimony from Bill Taylor today?</p><p>[10:40:00]</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I think it's pretty damning already, just based on the revelation of the text exchanges that Ambassador Taylor was part of. So -- and I don't know how he can, you know, walk those back. So I think it's potentially quite damning.</p><p>But also, observe that I think what he'll say is corroborative. In other words, supportive of previous testimonies. And what we already know from the whistleblower complaint itself, as well as the memo of the conversation published by the White House, of the actual phone call between the president and President Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>HARLOW: I'd like to spend some time talking about the whistleblower. Because we're just -- we're in uncharted territory, right? The statute that protects whistleblowers in this country, the way it is written never even considered someone blowing the whistle on the president or having to protect the whistleblower -- a whistleblower from a president. But here is what the president said about that person yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The whistleblower gave a false account. Now, you have to say, well, do we have to protect somebody that gave a false account? You know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they're angels, OK? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation?</p><p>HARLOW: What do you make of that?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, first of all, it's wrong. First point is the law requires -- and this is what was done in this case -- the intelligence community inspector general to do what he -- within 14 days, to corroborate the content of the whistleblower complaint, which he did. And he found it credible and urgent. And so on the face of it, what the president's asserting is incorrect.</p><p>And, yes, you do need -- you are required to protect whistleblowers no matter about the veracity of what they allege. And the reason for that is to ensure that wrongdoing -- fraud, waste, abuse, moral, ethical lapses, whatever -- that there is a legitimate and protected conduit for intelligence community employees to convey that to the appropriate authorities, in this case, the inspector general of the I.C. (ph) and in turn the Congress.</p><p>HARLOW: Director Clapper, is there any reason to believe that the president may know who the whistleblower is?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, he may not know but just -- and as loathe as I am to contribute in any way to identifying the whistleblower, just based on what's been in the media -- since I don't know him, I don't know who it is. But given his home agency -- his or her apparent home agency affiliation and apparently on rotation to the NSC, and an expert on Ukraine, well, that's a fairly small population of people so it's hard for me to believe that somebody in the White House doesn't know who it is.</p><p>Now, if they are -- if people in the White House are shielding that or insulating the president from that, well, good on them for doing that.</p><p>HARLOW: How small a population of people are we talking about here? Because if the --</p><p>CLAPPER: Well --</p><p>HARLOW: Go ahead.</p><p>CLAPPER: Not very many. You know, use all your fingers on both hands and not -- you know, both hands and not use all the fingers. I don't think that population -- if you do the Venn diagram, that's not very many people.</p><p>HARLOW: So we saw Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer write this letter to the acting DNI and the ICIG, saying, tell us what you're doing to protect this person. Do you have confidence that this person is being protected to the utmost extent? What protections are in place to ensure that?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I believe I know -- because I've talked with them about it, and witnessed his testimony -- that the acting director of national intelligence, Joe Maguire, is strongly committed to protecting the anonymity of the whistleblower, and I'm sure they're pulling out all the stops.</p><p>I don't know what's been done, and I could -- and I'd rather not speculate on it. But --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CLAPPER: -- I'm quite sure that the intelligence community, and specifically the DNI -- acting DNI is doing all he can to protect him or her.</p><p>HARLOW: And finally, we heard the president in those comments yesterday, even allude to the possibility -- completely unfounded, not based in fact -- that it could be Adam Schiff. Just listen to what the president said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be Shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it's possibly Schiff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Beyond the -- obviously, it's not part of all of this, what's the danger in that? You know, regardless of politics and political party, to have a sitting president of the United States say that a sitting member of Congress, a chair of the House Intel Committee could be the whistleblower?</p><p>[10:45:08]</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, first of all, I don't know how -- I mean, this -- what this implies, I guess, is that somehow Adam Schiff was party to or listened in on the original conversation, and then provided that to somebody in the intelligence community who then was going to write a whistleblower complaint, which on its face, is absurd.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>CLAPPER: And it's just another case of the president trying to change the narrative, you know, distract, et cetera. But on its face, it just doesn't make sense.</p><p>HARLOW: It does not. Director Clapper, thank you for your expertise on all of this. I appreciate it.</p><p>CLAPPER: Thanks, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. We are learning that federal and state officials just met behind closed doors yesterday, to talk Facebook and the possibility of major antitrust case. Much more after the break.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. For the first time in 10 years, Israel may soon have a new leader because, for the second time this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to form a new government. That opens the door for his main rival, Benny Gantz, to try.</p><p>Netanyahu could not convince Gantz to agree to a power-sharing deal, and there's no guarantee that Gantz will be able to form a coalition. That raises the possibility of a third general election within a year, as the political deadlock there continues.</p><p>Meantime, we are just learning that federal officials and state attorney generals met to discuss possibly pursuing a future antitrust case against Facebook. They met during a daylong session yesterday. In fact, just this hour, Congressman Ro Khanna told me yes, he agrees with Elizabeth Warren. Facebook has too much political power.</p><p>Brian Fung, our tech reporter who is breaking all of this news left and right, joins me now with more. How significant is that, that you have state A.G.s meeting with others in Washington to look at an antitrust effort against Facebook?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Well, this meeting signals that these investigators and regulators are moving forward on their investigation of Facebook. You know, we know that federal officials and state officials routinely collaborate. But in this case, you know, you have some reservations by state officials who believe the federal government's not moving fast enough or quickly enough.</p><p>HARLOW: Because some polling recently showed that I think it's like over 70 percent of Americans don't know that Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp. So they don't understand sort of the total power and reach that they have.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is talking. He's out, he's doing a series of interviews. We saw him on \"Fox News,\" we saw him on NBC last night. One thing that struck me about his interview last night was the defense he gave for Facebook allowing false political ads to continue running on the platform. Let's just listen to that for a moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESTER HOLT, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR: Do you feel like you're giving a green light to politicians, that --</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: No, look --</p><p>HOLT: -- lie, lie lie?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: -- I believe that it is important for people to be able to hear and see what politicians are saying. I think that when they do that, that speech will be heavily scrutinized by other journalists, by other people --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And \"The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that there has been discussion within Facebook about -- at least they were thinking, do we just not run political ads completely?</p><p>FUNG: Yes. And that's something that Zuckerberg mentioned when he gave a speech at Georgetown University --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>FUNG: -- last week, defending his company's position on this. Obviously, Facebook has been caught up in an imbroglio, I guess, with Senator Warren, who's running for president, where Warren called out Facebook's policy of not sending politicians' ads to third-party fact- checkers. And in fact, Warren took out an ad herself, on Facebook --</p><p>HARLOW: A false one, to make the point.</p><p>FUNG: Exactly, making the point that Facebook, you know, falsely -- saying that Facebook has endorsed President Trump for re-election. We of course know that's not true. But you know, Warren's point was, this underscores how Facebook continues to allow politicians to lie on the platform.</p><p>HARLOW: It feels to me -- and you, this is your beat, you know it well -- but it feels to me like something is changing in Washington. Whether it's Representative Ro Khanna, who's -- Silicon Valley is in his district, he is -- he was, at least, against breaking up big tech, breaking up Facebook when I had him on in July. Today, he just told me they have too much political power.</p><p>You've got Republican Josh Hawley in the Senate, who's calling for them to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram. It seems to me as though there is a bipartisan change, and I wonder if you think it's a sea change that Facebook is up against in Washington.</p><p>FUNG: I think we'll see evidence of that, probably at tomorrow's hearing where Zuckerberg is going to be testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Nominally, it's a hearing about Facebook's expansion into financial services like its digital currency, Libra. But you know, I think we can expect a lot of pushback from lawmakers about things like political ads --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>FUNG: -- and Facebook's role in shaping our political discourse.</p><p>HARLOW: There was a really important announcement yesterday from Facebook overnight, that they removed fake accounts created by Russian trolls -- Iran, China, et cetera, trying to do the same thing in 2020.</p><p>FUNG: Yes. So you saw Facebook saying it's taken down dozens of Instagram accounts that it believes are linked to Russian operatives who are trying --</p><p>[10:55:01]</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>FUNG: -- to spread the same sort of disinformation that we saw in 2016. You know, those ads and -- I'm sorry, those accounts were spreading memes and images that are meant to sow discord among Americans. And, you know, you had some targeting even Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you very much, Brian. Good to have you. We'll see what happens in that hearing tomorrow. I appreciate it very much.</p><p>The top American diplomat in Ukraine right now is behind closed doors, testifying before Congress. He's been there for more than an hour. What insight will Bill Taylor give to House investigators in the impeachment inquiry? Stay with us for that. We'll see you back here tomorrow morning.</p><p>[11:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019102204CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB9-RTW1-JB20-G1R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Could you please take your seats and could you please turn off your cell phones? We're recording this meeting as well. And it will be broadcasted through the Internet. And during the Q&amp;A session, we kindly request you to raise your hands as always and wait for the microphone so you can pose your question so that everyone can see what we're doing.</p><p>So it's with great pleasure that Apimec S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, represented by myself, I am Lucy Sousa, I'm the Chairman of Apimec S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo. This is the reinsurance IRB-Brasil company, that is part of the Novo Mercado; and those that are following us through the Internet. And I would also like to introduce here, Mr. Fernando Passos, Deputy CEO, Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer; Marcelo Hirata, Information Technology and Facilities Director; Lucas Aristides Mello, Strategy and Innovation Director.</p><p>And I would like to give the floor to Fernando Passos.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS, DEPUTY CEO, CFO, IR OFFICER &amp; VP, IRB-BRASIL RESSEGUROS S.A.: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, Lucy, and thank you for everyone for participating in this meeting. This is our third Apimec meeting and this is something that we've been doing since our IPO. The theme that will be discussed today is highly related to the transformation -- the digital transformation process, and our company has been going through this process in the last years. It is also related to how the company is positioning itself in order to continue being a leading reinsurance company of new insurance businesses that are emerging from the digital world.</p><p>This theme that will be debated today emerged because of a survey that we carried out with our shareholders with the analysts of the -- with the company. This was also retrospective of the past 2 Apimecs, the first meeting that we carried out after our IPO and also this was a request from you. The company shared its risk pricing model and we also shared with you a little bit about our retrocession contract process.</p><p>Last year, we spoke a little bit about risk research, especially in property and especially when we think about life insurance. And in life insurance, we focused on the new products that the company was launching. And this year, as I just mentioned, the focus of our conversation is going to be the digital transformation process. And this is a process that the company has been going through during the past 5 years, and how we have prepared ourselves to continue being the leading reinsurance company of the new insurance businesses that are emerging.</p><p>What is interesting in this strategy is, as you know, when the company was positioning itself as a reinsurance company that is capable of leading the reinsurance contract of the new players that are emerging in the insurance market, the company has also prepared itself in order to support the digital transformation of the traditional insurance companies that are our customers.</p><p>Turning this service and giving -- this is becoming an additional relevant product that the company makes available to the insurance companies that are our customers. Now clearly, we do not see a trade-off between the traditional insurance business and the new businesses that are emerging in the digital era. Our company does understand that both businesses have their space.</p><p>We also understand that traditional insurances are doing their homework in order to become more competitive in the future. And IRB as a reinsurance company has given support to our customers, be it in Brazil or be it in South America in this transformation process.</p><p>I will give the floor now to Hirata and Lucas. Lucas is Director of the innovation area and he also covers the business aspect, and he works with the reinsurance businesses in the digital area. And Hirata works with information technology. And both of them will tell you our current situation.</p><p>Lucas, Hirata, you have the floor now.</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO, STRATEGY &amp; INNOVATION DIRECTOR, IRB-BRASIL RESSEGUROS S.A.: First and foremost, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for participating in this meeting. Fernando, thank you very much for your opening speech. What we want to do now is to show you how innovation has become the main pillar of our corporate strategy. And it's interesting to initiate this debate with you, showing you that innovation within IRB emerge within the customer area.</p><p>The customer area today that is part of our management understood that if we are capturing all the needs of our customers regarding market positioning. Here, we understood that it was important. So within the customer and the business area, we believe that innovation had to exist because innovation should come -- should be focused on customers as well as the benchmark that we've been carried out with the market in the digital world.</p><p>And here, we will start talking about this because for a complete journey of strategies, of market approach, our customers, that our insurance company are partners, we had to simplify the process, we had to translate all of this.</p><p>We -- this is very relevant in Latin America and we needed to focus on innovation. And we created our main statements, and this is something that we're going to share with you. And now the culture of the company is presenting a result that is geared towards a problem.</p><p>We've understood that innovation is the answer to a problem that we have defined. This is a paradox. This is a paradox between need and desire, and IRB believe that the customer was the key for this strategy.</p><p>And to generate an innovation, we believe that it's important and necessary to generate value, both strategic and financial. This is an important thing. And here, yes, within our structure, we have to be able to build a highly structured process within our company in order to attain the expected results in a strategic way and also in a financial way.</p><p>And at last, with all -- when you better understand what was innovation for IRB, towards where should we go, we understood that a balanced portfolio that would have an innovation horizon that would cover short, middle and long term, well, we believe that this would be the future. So as of the moment that we understood the main concepts of innovation for the insurance and reinsurance area, well, we decided that we had to share our experience.</p><p>So what we had done, this slide here shows us in a highly detailed way our portfolio -- our innovation portfolio, our initiatives. Here, you can see our different projects. So we have built within the company 5 main levers, 5 main levers so that we're able to drive our business so that we can promote innovation in our company and in the market for our customers, not only tradition insurance company but also the new players that are emerging in the market.</p><p>In order to be objective this morning, here we decided to select 5 items, 5 items so that we can explore them. And here, we can translate what generates greater value to the company, and this is something that we want to share. We will talk about disruptive innovation, open innovation and we will talk about data analytics and digital transformation. These are the pillars of our corporate strategy and they're part of our next step regarding the future.</p><p>Our first initiative, and we will talk about blockchain. This is a very important subject that initiated with the cryptocurrencies. And also -- this also attracted the reinsurance and the insurance company, what the blockchain will give to the insurance company as a whole. We understand that this is the next step.</p><p>But before I present to you what I or we try to execute in terms of blockchain, first, we will show you 3 main items that we believe that will make you understand, that if all of us understand them, we will know how positive the impact of blockchain can be in the insurance market and how IRB is being a pioneer in Latin America and in Brazil.</p><p>The first thing is very simple, the concept in transaction blockchain environment, it potentially is going to disappear. It will transform itself very deeply and everybody knows that in the financial reinsurance</p><p>(foreign language)</p><p>trying to simplify this concept with these smart contracts. Smart contracts are nothing more and nothing less. It is a simple way of controlling and automating processes. This is simple. So situation A and situation B have to generate situations and blockchain and smart contracts do this. This is a no-brainer when you think about economy of scale. But moreover, people ask us why blockchain for insurance -- so transformational in our industry.</p><p>So let's go to the first slide that the innovation is the answer to our problem. All of us are insured, we know that insurance in Brazil is an experience full of red tape, bad claim, [helping] everything turns the experience and perception is of cost and we believe that (inaudible).</p><p>Now for other innovative products, and we have to see this as a solution. And when we assess the market as a whole, the corporate, the reinsurance companies, it's their [intermediation], we have fragmented data sources, frauds, human mistakes will be assessed. That means the problems will identify a lot of synergy with what blockchain delivers.</p><p>Now going to our next slide, I'm going to show you what IRB is doing before the scenario of extreme disruption in terms of transaction and in terms of process control and process automation, where we have our partnership with B3i. It's the greatest consortia of blockchain technology development. They're based in Switzerland. And as IRB is the greatest player in Brazil and very relevant in Latin America, in addition to being highly recognized because of their benchmarking, we were invited to participate in this consortium.</p><p>And this consortium today is responsible for developing the technologies that will be implemented in the insurance and the reinsurance market. And IRB will be responsible for disseminating the concept and the knowledge and the platform of blockchain geared toward the reinsurance and insurance market in Latin America. So the result of all of this takes us to our next step. We are going to give talks, we will encourage our customers. And here, we have all the benefits.</p><p>And I would like to draw your attention to our next slide, especially where we have simplified the access to the customer data and how you share this information, automatic update. Didn't you have 3, 4 insurance policies and one with -- each one with different insurance company, different date, different brokers, different management processes. This is one of the problems that blockchain is going to resolve and we want to disseminate this new concept in the insurance and the reinsurance market to be more focused on our customers.</p><p>As the second initiative that is part of our strategy, we have our open innovation program, our Insurtech Innovation Program. So basically, our Insurtech Innovation Program, Insurtech is a term that we define for the technology companies geared toward insurance and reinsurance company. We developed the first open innovation program with the external and the external environment of the company that would engage the Brazilian academia and business partners. And the target is to carry out research, innovation and development in innovation. So we had another of -- a number of effects for our industry, and I'm going to share the results in our next slide.</p><p>As you can see here, we mobilized around 1,000 students in 2019, 1,000 undergraduates of a number of courses, graduate and postgraduate courses. And we're innovating together with them, we're innovating together with the universities and together with our partners. As first delivery of the program, what did we have? IRB has around 80 employees that are interacting with the academia, interacting with our customer to generate this innovation and I can share this with you. I am a sponsor of the program. I define and I vote on the [our pitch] days within our program. And it is impressive to see.</p><p>And I would like to show you how the academia now is something strong. This is strong. This is very important for the insurance and reinsurance market, and we're attracting new talents, we're attracting people that didn't have great knowledge of the insurance market. And they saw this is as a new area to work. And we are attracting these brilliant minds and this has resulted in over 40 projects that have been presented and 13 are in acceleration. 13 of these projects are with (inaudible) isolatedly accelerated a number of technologies use blockchain once again, but focusing on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, mobile for underwriting and (inaudible).</p><p>I will give the floor to our Technology Director, Marcelo Hirata, to share with you how we are in terms of infrastructure and analytics, and we will continue debating and we will tell you how we're going to generate more value.</p><p>Hirata, you have the floor.</p><p>MARCELO HIRATA, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY &amp; FACILITIES DIRECTOR, IRB-BRASIL RESSEGUROS S.A.: Thank you, Lucas. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to share with you an overview of the technology, the back story of the technology used by IRB, how this technology has been helping us to leverage our transformational processes. The IRB has systematically done this, invested for the past 5 years in technology. And those investments have led to the following infrastructure.</p><p>It is a very robust infrastructure, scalable and also safe, an infrastructure which has its main site in Rio de Janeiro and a replicated site here in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, which ensures us that we'll never shut down because the whole site is automatically replicated with redundancies and performance checks. And now this base is covered, if I may, by different safety or security levels or the whole environment is protected.</p><p>We know today that cybersecurity issues are very hot, among the 5 hottest topics discussed by the market. And today, the IRB has at least 10% of its budget in TI geared towards protection, monitoring and information security, so that our environment will not be attacked. And if that will happen, how we are going to respond to protect all the information we hold within the organization. So this is an environment that is monitored 24 hours a day across the world and it is a unique environment.</p><p>Several companies from other industries: insurance, reinsurance and others, knock on our doors to try and understand how we apply best practices in security, how we implement all those solutions around security and how we manage and monitor all the platform. We have -- we see companies from Brazil, from abroad, from Europe, from Asia, who come to us to learn and understand how our facilities work.</p><p>Our employees here at IRB have immediate access in real time, online, from anywhere in the world. If one of our managers is closing a deal in any country in the world, in Singapore, for example, he or she will automatically have access to our installations, our platform, if you will, access our applications. And he or she will be able to process risk simulations, proposal models and close a deal right there and then without having to be physically present at IRB. That's a unique advantage which drew the attention of several organizations.</p><p>Another important aspect to emphasize is the following. Today, we host softwares and apps which are also very robust, such as SAS, SAP, managing -- catastrophe management, processes, data analytics, which I'll go into detail going forward. I'm talking about 80 years' worth of information stored here. And all of this was done because 5 years ago we migrated 230 legacy systems that the company had to SAP. But I'm not talking about a simple migration, the migration entailed know-how, technology, business knowledge, all migrated into the SAP. So today, our SAP is unique to IRB.</p><p>Just to give you an idea, we have around 250 business rules applied to our SAP system, all of them focused on our market. And those business rules were acquired and processed through the experience we have accrued throughout our journey all those years. And as I said, it is unique to our company so that that infrastructure that I mentioned helps host all that wealth of information.</p><p>And we're also ready for the next step, the next phase. In 2017, we started our journey towards the cloud. And we started with our first migrations back in 2017. As Lucas mentioned, innovation started from the vision of our clients, our customers who came to us with new demands; and also internally with our training systems and HR management processes. In 2018, we sped up our journey towards the cloud when we migrated our apps and collaboration systems, e-mail servers and so on and so forth, anything and everything that makes us more comfortable in terms of safety and security.</p><p>In 2019, we have accelerated our migration process towards the cloud, and we have implemented technological platforms, all of them taken to the cloud. So now we have a whole series of modules from SAP already running in the cloud. And in 2020, we intend to further speed up the process so that new systems and new apps that we develop or purchase will already emerge in the cloud environment.</p><p>It's important to emphasize that this environment was prepared to meet LGDP requirements. So when we moved to the cloud, we already have in mind how to treat that technology in light of the new legislation. And earlier this year, in a partnership with one of the big 4 companies, we started a journey around assessment and use of best practices, also aiming at meeting LGDP requisites. 8 months after the process started, we have -- we concluded our journey and we are now in compliance throughout all processes and systems required by law. We are fully complied -- in full compliance now.</p><p>And when that compliance was measured in a scale from 0 to 5, we, today, rank at 4.5 in terms of legislation compliance. So we are very comfortable in that respect. Other organizations, once again, came to us to try to understand how we manage to do that in such a short period of time involving such a wealth of systems and information, how we managed to meet all the compliance requirements.</p><p>All of that has helped us speed up our digital transformation. Starting 2017, we further accelerated the company's digital transformation as we implemented new solutions and new apps to our business. We have managed to leverage our operational efficiency. We brought in more scalability. All of those models, as I said, already emerge in the cloud digitally and they also [put] the company in line with this strategy just mentioned by Lucas, and he will come back to this subject in a moment.</p><p>So briefly going over the slide. Today, we have the SAS technology, that's our pricing model. With partnership with SAS and with the IRB know-how, we have implemented a solution which is totally automated by which, in no time, we have ideas or estimates of prices, margins that the company can propose to a client. Before, we used Excel spreadsheets with human intervention taking a long time. All of that today takes minutes to be completed.</p><p>Speaking a bit about front end, also through partnerships, we have managed to standardize all our front end, our contact with our internal employees and clients. So we have only one single layer of communication with our employees. So through this layer, everyone can know what app they need to access, what information they need to insert or import or extract and how they should within a systematic workflow.</p><p>Salesforce down here, it's where we manage our interaction with clients. So both our customers and our account managers, both parties, can have access to this information that is available. It's a single point of contact. And we have the clients' data at the tip of our fingers, just by checking the system. Very fast, very efficient, very straightforward.</p><p>And finally, the SAP, our main back office system, which allows all those interactions to be processed, to be ensured, to be accurate and it also allows us -- or allows the whole company, the whole organization, to be on the same page in terms of information, revenue, sales and so on. It's important to emphasize that all those apps use know-how that IRB has across several business areas.</p><p>I mentioned pricing earlier. In pricing, we have around 250 business rules that I had mentioned. As for CRM, we're talking about 2,500 business rules which we apply. For SAP, another 350 rules. So those apps are unique to the organization. And as I understand it, in our market, IRB stands ahead of the pack. It's hard to see a company which is even remotely close to the know-how that we have with the platforms we have implemented in our company.</p><p>As an example -- as another example, the technical management of our accounts. As I said, we used Excel spreadsheets; and today, it's all done through digital platforms, SAS, so on, pricing, as I mentioned, and for claims also. I'd like also to mention that all those applications, they migrate to the mobile part. In other words, it's also accessible by a smartphone anytime, anywhere in the world. So our executives are able to approve, assess, analyze any kind of proposal or assess any kind of need that the organization might have.</p><p>And finally, talking a bit about data. Today, we know that data is the buzzword, data is the new oil, if I may. So IRB being 80 years old and having interacted throughout its history with both insurance and reinsurance companies or markets, we have built a huge database with data from several industries, several companies, several business models.</p><p>In 2016, and realizing that data was increasingly important, we started a journey to structure that data. Disorganized data mean nothing, as you know. But when you have data which is organized, which can be applied smartly, that data becomes important, relevant information, information that can be strategic also for the company.</p><p>That structuring was completed. Today, we have structured data. We have information we can extract from several sources, both internal and external, and that information feed back into other apps which are important for our business.</p><p>For example, our solution in partnership with RMS, which monitors climate, which helps us in our agribusiness arm and also when we analyze catastrophes and so on, and all of that was made possible because this app with RMS, again, done through a partnership that we have developed. And based on all the information we have available, we are able to generate preventive information so that you can have the best proposal with the best margin and the lowest risk to offer to our clients.</p><p>We also have SAS also coming from that information. Based on the information, we are able to generate the best analytical models, both for market, for products, for performance, for pricing.</p><p>And ArcGIS, which is disaster monitoring. Any disaster anywhere in the world -- an earthquake, tsunami, hurricanes, we can monitor that. And from then on, all the simulation for claims and in terms of making a proposition or proposal, all of that is based on this application.</p><p>And that result can only be achieved through information, through the data we have in our analytics arm and also through the know-how we have been able to accumulate throughout the years. That data part is our fuel, if you will, our base for our AI processes, our machine learning operations, which are already in operation, which will lead us to a next level in terms of innovation for the company.</p><p>That's what I had to say, and I give the floor back to Lucas to continue the presentation.</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO: Okay. Hirata, thank you very much. Thanks to our team and the technology arm. We have CRM as an example, which has really delivered our AI area. To build an automatic pipeline of business is very relevant. The amount of rules we have implemented allows IRB to have an automated risk pipeline which translates into opportunities for the company. So the whole system feeds back on itself. And every year, we have a very clear view of our risks, especially in the Brazilian and Latin American markets.</p><p>So in light of all of that, in light of all the infrastructure that Hirata shared with you today, our part of business intelligence, market intelligence that made IRB a benchmarking company in both the insurance and reinsurance market. So our idea is to share with you 2 other examples in terms of new business developments with technology companies.</p><p>This next slide shows a bit of our horizontal dimensions, if I may. The main dimensions of our management, client management and business management, which are quite unique to us, very unique to our business because we have this unique database. As Hirata mentioned, our subscription technology, our pricing technology is very unique.</p><p>And number six, our potential to develop new products and services. It's a very lean, efficient company, very agile, especially when we try to develop new products and services. And that makes us a very special company in this market. We are, at the end of the day, the only option for new companies, for new platforms.</p><p>I'm talking about fintechs, construtechs, healthtechs, logtechs or even Software-as-a-Service companies, we are the main favored partner, a partner that will be able to develop the insurance business for that -- for those companies. Of course -- without causing damage to our current customers, of course. We're also always trying to look for timely opportunities for them as well.</p><p>But the idea under this pillar, for tech companies development is, along with this new world of these new companies, new industries, to explore this unique database that we have and to tap into our expertise in terms of pricing, risk assessment and into our knowledge of our multidisciplinary teams, we can develop with startups and tech companies. If they want to build an insurance model, the IRB will be their preferred option. C6 Bank is a (inaudible) we have already publicized that.</p><p>And in the next slide, we have something which is quite important. It's a very dense slide, but that's the message we want to convey. That slide shows us how much insurance and reinsurance, those industries are going through a very complex transformation right now. And insurtechs are increasingly present along that value chain with then the development of new products, marketing, sales, distribution channels. We've heard about several insurtechs which are focused on that: risk assessment, subscription assessment, claims management and even asset management.</p><p>I was recently in Las Vegas at the main innovation event in the world. In 1 day, in 1 day, over 350 insurtechs presented new solutions, 350 companies presenting new risk modeling opportunities. Companies saying, for example, that you can post the claim by simply filming your car and that will be able for the company to assess the damage. So that kind of thing is happening in our industry. There's no turning back.</p><p>And the idea with this slide is to show you that the IRB try to position itself as a value generator across the whole business chain. Across this whole business chain, we try to create new relationships with all of those companies so that we would not only innovate along with them, but also we could boost our current clients using new technology, exponential technology, and that slide is a snapshot of that.</p><p>As an example, I have a case study we are now assessing of a logtech, a logistics company, a supply chain company, which looked us up because they wanted to forward their insurance business. And IRB, with its expertise and market knowledge, accelerated development of new businesses. And in tune with this new demand from customers, we try to use new models to establish partnerships with those kinds of companies. So this is a very iconic example to show you how much we have moved along those new pillars, along new business models looking to the future.</p><p>And lastly, also -- we also have been assessing Big Tech developments. IRB believes that there is a lot of potential there as well, potential to generate a great impact in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the world. So we cannot leave that aside, we have to be paying attention to Big Techs. And we'll share with you how we have structured the company to explore that.</p><p>And we start by sharing a statement, which was recently published on The Economist that said, \"The future of insurance is happening without insurance firms.\" The future is happening outside the insurance companies. And then we included 2 question marks because we do not really believe in that statement. We do believe that the insurance industry is changing. Our customers, the companies are evolving. And the IRB, in particular, is trying to evolve along with customers in the market and bringing along this new technological wave.</p><p>So it is extremely relevant for us take that statement into account, especially number one, which concerns Big Tech, because we need to understand that new players are coming. A new market is knocking on our door, Big Techs are right there. So that's why IRB has positioned itself as a benchmark for our industry, working as a transformation engine for the market. And today, we can translate that innovation to our clients.</p><p>And how can we demonstrate that to you? How can we translate that in a more concrete, real term? Through several interactions we have conducted, we have been doing this for 2 years with the whole innovation ecosystem, consultancies, Big Techs, tech companies, our customers, our innovation area works within our customer management area that allows us to understand that the growth of IRB will come from innovating as a Big Tech and along with the Big Techs.</p><p>When we combine a very lean structure, resulting, of course, in a focus on customers' experience and customers' results, and as a consequence, we can lead to more business traffic within our platform, as I just mentioned. And Hirata's team has worked hard on that. We can feed all that information back into our system. And that's why we have such a relevant market share in Brazil of over 37% and also a very relevant presence across Latin America. And this whole set of data generates a lot of value. And that's where the IRB stands out as the main engine for the development of innovation processes for the insurance and reinsurance industries.</p><p>And that's what we'd like to share with you. We were looking at an 80-year-old company that positions itself as a very lean, efficient, customer-centered company. And that's why we are now reaping the results in terms of return to investors, return to shareholders and market share. So that's another real case we'd like to share with you.</p><p>A Big Tech came to us to structure their insurance businesses. From the very beginning, they shared with us their will to develop their insurance business and they look for us because we had this -- all this knowledge, this technology through proportional contracts, through regulatory economics model. And IRB positions itself, as I said, a preferred partner, and we are able to generate value to big companies that want to start in this market.</p><p>Our next slide, moving towards the end of our presentation, this is the last one, is to share with you the result of all of that, which can be translated as network, which is global, exclusive, unique in Brazil and that, today, allowed IRB to connect the main platforms in the world, from the Silicon Valley to Europe to China for the development of venture capital, high tech companies, partners, accelerators, universities, startups and so on.</p><p>All of that makes IRB a company which is prepared to develop the future of insurance and reinsurance in Brazil. That's where we are focused on to share with you some of that journey of customer interactions so that they can be ready for our next step. That's what I have to share with you today, IRB: From today to tomorrow. Thank you very much.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Ladies and gentlemen, in order to bring the presentation to an end and to entertain our Q&amp;A session, I believe that the message that we wanted to convey today was to show you our study cases something that Lucas demonstrated in generically because they're protected by a nondisclosure agreement. And here, you can see what is happening in the insurance and the reinsurance market and how we're positioning ourselves in new businesses that are emerging.</p><p>I believe the example of a logtech, a logistics company, and as this company came to IRB and they have a business plan to embark in the insurance market to create an insurance company and they've already come to IRB to talk. The -- we are establishing a long-term contract with this, and the company is giving them support so that they can create their business in an efficient way and that is economically profitable and it is highly structured.</p><p>This is a case that really draw your attention because other cases like this technology companies, healthtechs are mobilizing themselves to create their own insurance businesses. And thanks to our positioning, they come to us from the beginning so that we can have a long-term contract. I believe that this really shows us that the company is prepared itself to position itself in this new world that is emerging.</p><p>We also have a Big Tech that plans to create an insurance business in Brazil. And since the beginning, since the initial studies, they've been talking to us so that we can give them support in the financial feasibility, and we're establishing a future contract, that would be a long-term reinsurance contract. This was excellent so that you could see how Apimec is doing.</p><p>Here, you can see our digital transformation process. I believe that Hirata showed this -- Hirata showed us customized systems through specific business rules that are unique of IRB. These are not systems that have been replicated or that the competition will have access. The competition has access to the standard systems that are much more basic than what we actually have.</p><p>And it's also important to highlight that the evolution that we have had regarding data analytics and data manipulation is important. As Hirata mentioned, today we have become a benchmark in the industry of reinsurance. We have received visits from great reinsurance companies because they want to get to know our data analytics platform. With the evolution in data manipulation, we present a unique competitive advantage in the Brazilian market, and we're structuring our database per country in South America.</p><p>So now I will give the floor to Lucy, so she can coordinate our Q&amp;A session.</p><p>LUCY SOUSA: So we can initiate our Q&amp;A session now. Nonetheless, Fernando, I would like to hand in on behalf of Apimec S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo (technical difficulty) a stamp, 3 years of public meetings Apimec S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, thank you for the partnership. And I hope our partnership continues for a long period of time. I would just like to remind you, you received an assessment slips and this is very important for Apimec from IRB. On your way out, could you please hand in the evaluation slips to our receptionist. These questionnaires are used to rank the best meeting of the year where we hope -- if you're interested, please, you can only post 2 questions and be very straight to the point.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Luis Efren], investor. Regarding LGPD and data sharing. All the players that have access to the database, it could be from IRB or it can be from any other information cluster in the company, I believe that there are different metrics. So what is the criticality level of this operation. How critical is this operation?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Well, yes, you're absolutely right. There are different metrics. And through these metrics, we made agreements with our suppliers and customers clarifying what is of our responsibility and what is the responsibility of these third parties, and all of them signed this agreement.</p><p>MARCO CALVI, RESEARCH ANALYST, ITA\u00c3\u00ba CORRETORA DE VALORES S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Marco from Itau BBA. Lucas, could you -- I believe that you were very clear when you talked about blockchain and all the benefits that this will provide to your customer. Could you elaborate a bit in figures? Could you quantify how much you expect to attain from this initiative in the long term -- in the short term?</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO: Thank you for your question. We believe that during the next year the return will not be so significant. Nonetheless, what we believe is that in a 5-year period when you see the market in the middle term, when you work with this type of technology, well, I believe that the growth will be exponential. Today, we're talking about billions of dollars in savings. But until the technology is fully deployed in our customers, this takes some time. So this is why -- why we are anticipating this trend? We're trying to anticipate the change that we will see in the market and we will start doing things as of now. Next year, we don't expect a significant return from this technology. But in the other years, I believe that up to 5 years, we will have a substantial margin that will come from this initiative.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Manuel Hoz]. Congratulations for your presentation. It was excellent. I have a question regarding the company's future scenario. Of course, this is connected to the economic development. I would like to know how IRB sees growth of this sector. And you said that you have a 37% share in Brazil, and what is the second company in terms of share? And how can this company threaten you in this segment?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: The Brazilian market, well, I believe that we have 37% of market share. The second player has 6% of market share. Now when we compare the business models between IRB and the other reinsurance companies, I believe that this is not -- we have -- our business model is to be a leader in the insurance contracts. And like in the union, you have a player that is a leader that prices the risk, that discusses the clauses or the conditions that are created with the insurance company is the one that sees with the insurance the great risk and seeing the pricing and seeing probabilities of [luck], and we regulate the major claims.</p><p>So this is the figure of the leader of the union. And generally, within the union, you have a group of followers that are capital providers and that follow the decisions of a leader. When there is a claim, you don't have 15 reinsurance companies, each one doing their loss adjustments, their claim -- well, the leader does this and the main players follow the leader. The IRB has a predominant position in terms of reinsurance contracts in Brazil.</p><p>Now the business model of our competitors is geared towards -- they're like followers of this position. So when we see the specific Brazilian market and when we see the South American market specifically, none of them have customized solutions for the digital business world or the new businesses that are emerging in the world, like IRB has.</p><p>I believe that the case study that Lucas showed you, that a Big Tech wants to create an insurance company. This is a global company that wants to create an insurance company. Instead of going after a big insurance company, they wanted to talk to a local reinsurance company because we have partnerships in other places, by and large. This is our view.</p><p>CARLOS EDUARDO DALTOZO, HEAD OF VARIABLE INCOME, ELEVEN FINANCIAL RESEARCH: Carlos Daltozo from Financial Company. You showed us a scenario of the rupture of the insurance market, and you're a very important vehicle for new players, Big Tech, logistics companies and other sectors of the market. My question is, today, where does regulation clash into regulation because you're engaged in these new technologies?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Daltozo, just a comment. We do not see a scenario of rupture. We see a scenario of deep transformation, where new players are going to emerge in the digital world. But at the same time, we will see an evolution of the traditional players that are going towards this direction. And as IRB has prepared itself to service this new business model, this has become an important asset for us because we're providing additional services to our customers that would be the insurance companies and their digital transformation process.</p><p>Now regarding regulation, and maybe Lucas can add something, we have already -- we believe that the Brazilian regulators and some regulators in South America, like in the case of Colombia, in the case of Peru, and the regulators are holding public hearings and they're changing the regulation to allow to develop these new business that are evolving -- that are emerging in the digital world.</p><p>Lucas, would you like to say something?</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO: And something else, just to have a clear vision, and going back to the main comments in the presentation, I believe that the innovation will take place in the market. The regulator is never innovative and they shouldn't be because they should always regulate. And when innovation is developed within the company, the regulator has to follow this methodology.</p><p>As we can see in SUSEP, we have new updates, new announcements of sandboxes. When you -- because we want to improve the life of the startups and the companies that want to embark in the new scenario, the message that we want to convey to the market, don't worry a lot about regulation. Yes, we have to execute and we have to broaden the market, and yes, we would be able to capture the results of all of this.</p><p>And we have seen a very important evolution from SUSEP regarding regulation. So when we compare what SUSEP is doing comparison to American and European regulators, because they're ahead of us, I believe that SUSEP is not lagging behind when you compare them to the regulators of these developed countries. So I believe that SUSEP now is being very positive, and they are supporting this type of innovation that, of course, will improve the life of our consumers.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: And Lucas talks a lot to them, and we believe that SUSEP is doing an excellent job regarding the regulation of this new world that is emerging.</p><p>CARLOS EDUARDO DALTOZO: Just a second question, if you could answer, of course. But the partnership with Big Tech, is it Latin America or Brazil?</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO: It starts with Brazil, and we can extend it throughout South America, not Latin America. We recently held a debate together with the directors of SUSEP, and we talked about technology, and we believe that their position is very interesting. Especially regarding blockchain, SUSEP sees this very positively. SUSEP's vision of seeing blockchain and understanding that this could be much better, so -- and this will help them to inspect, to regulate and to carry out auditing. They believe that with good data, they can work better and this is the future, and this is what they should follow. I believe that this is a broad debate that they're having within the SUSEP environment.</p><p>EDUARDO ROSMAN, ANALYST, BANCO BTG PACTUAL S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Eduardo Rosman, BTG Pactual Bank. Two questions here. Number one, I would like to know if you can elaborate about your partnership with C6. So what kind of services are you offering? Because I understand that in a certain way, you are also going to the insurance market. So these are 2 sides.</p><p>And the second question would be in the release of your earnings result of the third quarter you clarified that you were able to improve significantly the retrocession contract. This expense that is an important expense, we believe that it will drop next year. Could you please tell us why this happened? How these negotiations took place? Up to what extent can you go? And perhaps, this is the main driver that will allow you to gain margin in the upcoming years.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Thank you very much, Rosman. So we will talk about both subjects and Lucas and Hirata, you can add anything. C6 is a digital bank. It was just launched. It became operational very recently. And when we see -- when we try -- of course, IRB was only positioned in the insurance market and they came to talk to us so that we, together, could develop the insurance operation that would be matched with bancassurance of a digital bank that was emerging. So we worked together on this project.</p><p>In the beginning, they decided not to have an insurance company. They created something that you call an MGA, that would be the bank together with IRB, outlined the process and insurance -- the customers' insurance experience. C6 is responsible for all the front end, all the interaction, all the development of the tool that interacts with the customer. IRB is responsible for everything regarding development and everything regarding pricing, claim regulation.</p><p>And together, we chose an insurance company that is Fairfax insurance company. Fairfax also contributed with their know-how. They have been a long-term partner. And the 3 companies outlined the model, the interaction with the customer is done by C6. So the pricing method is done by the IRB and also the business rules regarding claim regulations. So the insurer and policies that are sold through the C6 platform, they have (inaudible) that we announced.</p><p>Now these type of businesses, they don't make sense if they are not backed by a long-term insurance contract. So we cannot support a partner in best times, contribute with know-how for them to develop their insurance business and to have a 1-year reinsurance contract. So what we have is a proportional reinsurance contract of 10 years that can be renewed for 10 more years. And IRB and the other partners will be able to capture the results in the long term. So in a nutshell, the transaction that was announced between the partnership C6, Fairfax and IRB follows this structure.</p><p>Now speaking specifically about the retrocession contract, it's interesting because this was object of our first Apimec meeting, and here we could detail how these contracts worked. The IRB, during the last 3 years, has dropped its cost of retrocession. Unfortunately, during this year renewals -- well, this year, we were able to be very successful in this process, and we will be able to drop our cost of retrocession as we announced in our earnings result and this was dropped. And this reduction -- this was because of our technological development. And now we can give data to our retrocession contracts and now they can better price our risk. Now this technological evolution has helped us to improve the cost of retrocession.</p><p>Another point that has helped us is as the IRB has been recognized by the global reinsurance market in B3, B3i has 12 shareholders that are founding shareholders. So the IRB -- as IRB is part of this group, it shows you how the community is respecting IRB. And this translates in different players that are interested in working with us that in the past weren't interested in working with us. And now I believe that there is a more competitive process.</p><p>Now this year was different from last year and it was also different from 2014. I believe that in the year 2014, we were running after the retrocession contracts. Now this year, I believe we had a higher volume of offers and our underwriting volume was 3x more. So I believe that the competition lowered the price. So even the track record of the IRB, when we compare it to our claims, was also very important when we prove that the level of claims that we have today is stable. And I believe that the retrocessionaires feel more at ease to working with us. In the summary, it's this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you hear me? Just a follow-up on the retrocession issue. What can you tell us about the foreign exchange risk? We have the dollar going up and in the older contracts we had a forward-sold contracts. So were those contracts renewed or not?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: For this year's contract, as we did back in 2018 and '19, once again, we managed to negotiate our retrocession contracts in terms of having a cap for the U.S. dollar. Unlike what happened in 2019 where the cap was set at around 3.3, this year, we established a cap at 3.52. So there is a cap for 2020 but at a slightly higher level than we had for this year 2019, from 3.30 to 3.52.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: My name is [Manuel] and my first question -- you mentioned growth drivers for IRB, retrocession and others. My question is, what are the main drivers for the company, for the company's future growth in terms of revenue, performance? And how does that play out going forward?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: One of the growth drivers that we would like to cite that -- well, it's all that we have showed this morning, these new businesses emerging in the digital arena which will have a great impact, and Lucas said it very well, that has the potential to boost the company's growth in the mid-term, I'm talking about 5 years' horizon.</p><p>When we look at the Brazil's reality in terms of growth perspective for the company, for the market of reinsurance for 2020, what draws our attention is agribusiness-related insurance and reinsurance businesses. The Brazilian government has increased its subsidies for the purchase of farmers. It moved from BRL 400 million to BRL 1 billion as they pushed for 2020.</p><p>Recently, for those of you who want to know, the Ministry of Agriculture has posted on its website, projections that they believe represent the growth potential for agriculture-related insurance businesses. So I'm talking about an official information source and is available to anyone who wishes to consult.</p><p>Another growth driver in Brazil is the oil and gas industry. So as the last auctions have shown -- the last auctions promoted by the ANP, our oil fields have shown that the oil and gas industry has been growing faster than the GDP growth. So it has been an important growth leverage for 2019 and will continue to be so next year, an important growth leverage, the oil and gas industry.</p><p>Another element that was also important for our growth this year and that we see as a sustainable driver for next year as well has to do with the pricing of real estate assets, broadly speaking. The coverage limits for properties is pegged to the value of the properties, especially commercial properties. And with everything that has been happening with the interest rates, of course, pricing for real estate is going up. And with that, coverages are expanded. And with that, the premiums also grow.</p><p>And also, look, it's something that the company also was looking into in terms of customer management, that this is more a belief that we have for 2020, the civil construction industry, the housing industry. We see new launches, new housing starts and that's a driver under the engineering risks pillar, which was sort of latent for the last 4, 5 years because we had fewer housing starts, fewer launches. If that recovery does materialize, that, of course, will boost that line of business as well. So those would be the main drivers that we see materializing for next year in terms of Brazil.</p><p>When we look at the company's growth in South America, we believe that the company's market share is so limited in South America, ex Brazil, that our growth depends on IRB itself. In other words, the services that we are able to provide to our customers rather than on a market growth as a whole. Not in Brazil, of course, because we hold 37% of the market, so our growth has to do with market growth. But when we look at South America, our growth is more dependent on IRB positioning itself as a closer player, providing support, also in terms of digital transformation, as it was said, and then we can increase our share.</p><p>LUCY SOUSA: Anybody else? Any other question? Fernando?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can I ask a question? You said it very well when you talked about data, and we see that you are concerned about monitoring climate risks. Is that a work that is done internally? Or are you proactively looking or searching support from universities or other institutions? You mentioned the agricultural side, even for oil and gas, we just witnessed this disaster in our northeastern shore, of course that involves insurance as well. So I'd like to hear that from you, climate issues.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Perhaps Hirata could talk about the systems and I'll talk about the partnerships we have. We have partnerships with several institutions that help us make that kind of projection. Hirata might talk about the system, but I can always say that we have a very important partnership with Embrapa as they are an important provider in terms of climate data and also for the agricultural areas.</p><p>Embrapa is a very strong partner, has been with us for a long time since we were a state-owned company. And we have deep respect for Embrapa, and they provide big support for agriculture in Brazil. The IRB has a very strong partnership with them. And we also have other partnerships with private entities that provide services concerning information, not only in Brazil but in South America as a whole.</p><p>LUCAS ARISTIDES MELLO: Thank you, Fernando. And additionally, the application allows us to have or to share that monitoring, that's not only within IRB. All those partners that were mentioned by Fernando, they have access to the information, have access to the data and they might be able to generate notifications and alerts so that preventive action might be taken should a disaster happen or even to monitor proposals in the agribusiness realm or other areas.</p><p>If I may, as Hirata mentioned RMS, the IRB has developed a unique model to monitor climate in agriculture in Brazil. It will be the first model of climate modeling in Brazil developed by IRB, developed by or in conjunction with the multinational company, the RMS, and we'll make that available for the market to help boost the insurance market in the agricultural area along with Embrapa as it was mentioned. So with the statistical data, including soil profile, pasture quality, all of that will allow us to develop this model. And this model was about to be launched right, Hirata?</p><p>VIN\u00c3\u00adCIUS SOARES, ANALYST, BB-BANCO DE INVESTIMENTO S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mr. Soares from Banco do Brasil. You talk about scalability and return or returns in the mid-term, 5 years, as you mentioned. Can we expect IRB accepting lower margins and contracts in order to gain scale or gain share or even accepting or buying higher risks than it does today? Can we envision that going forward?</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: Vin\u00c3\u00adcius, what we see in business plans, specifically in that case, that is shown by Lucas, even the case study of the logistics company and what we see in business plans for healthtechs, construtechs, other companies which are getting ready to launch their insurance business, we're talking about even larger margins that we see in the reinsurance market today.</p><p>I'll give you an example. Going back to the C6 Bank case, to make it more material. With the C6 Bank, we'll have a shareholder in their insurance business, bancassurance. When we look at the insurance business for traditional banks, it's usually a business of a higher profitability, higher than our reinsurance business and which is withheld under the insurance companies controlled by banks.</p><p>So as we see it, and the C6 case is a concrete case and the business plans of insurance companies being developed by tech companies, that shows us that the IRB will be able to access a business niche of retail business which, today, is barely touched on the service. And it is a business that provides higher margins than the corporate risks arm. So it's the opposite, actually, as we understand it. Even though for the final customer, they'll have better pricing because those business were not accessed by the reinsurance market. The trend is that we'll see higher margins for the company, not lower.</p><p>LUCY SOUSA: Unfortunately, our time is up, and nobody else wanted to ask question. So on behalf of Apimec S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, I'd like to thank you all for this very productive meeting, very interesting topics were discussed. And thank you all for participating, both physically and those with us remotely via the Internet. Once again, Apimec is celebrating its 50th anniversary. And I give the floor over to Fernando for his final remarks and closing of the session.</p><p>FERNANDO PASSOS: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. Thank you for your time. A big thank you to all analysts for your time, your time dedicated to the company, the patience you have shown towards us and trying -- in terms of learning about a relatively new business in Brazil.</p><p>Thank you to all our colleagues, all our investors who have shown a lot of confidence in the company. Thank you. Have a nice day, everyone.</p><p>EDITOR: Statements in English on this transcript were spoken by an interpreter present on the live call.

Details of this offer are still in the works.</p><p>Ireland's move Tuesday is part of a broader effort to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals.</p><p>Google and Apple, for instance, are among the companies that have come under fire for shifting profit between international subsidiaries to take advantage of low tax rates in foreign countries.</p><p>The European Union's top regulator is currently investigating Apple's tax affairs in Ireland, claiming the company may have benefited from special treatment through a deal with Irish authorities.</p><p>Ireland's corporate tax rate -- at 12.5% -- is much lower than those offered in most other developed nations. But Apple has paid as little as 2% on profit attributed to its subsidiaries in Ireland.</p><p>Google responded to the Irish tax tweak by saying it would comply with the rules.</p><p>\"As we've always said, it's for governments to decide the law and for companies to comply with it. We're deeply committed to Ireland and will work to implement these changes as they become law,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>Apple maintained that it does not receive special treatment from Irish authorities, and would not comment directly on the latest Irish tax changes.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It is important that we interrogate and understand the real drivers of transformation so that we can be certain that the changes we are beginning to see are fully enabled to deliver the patient empowered, patient centric, community wide care delivery system we so desperately need.</p><p>While this headline worthy vision of transformation in healthcare may seem whimsical and wishful thinking to many, in fact, the vision for this type of connected care system has been considered and promoted for the last decade.</p><p>In Ireland, Sl\u00e1intecare (the 10-year program to transform our health system) was first considered in 2016 when the future of healthcare committee was established by the D\u00e1il (after much debate on the need for reform).  The objective of Sl\u00e1intecare is to keep people well at home for as long as possible and provide timely access to hospital services when necessary.</p><p>The technology has also been available for some time. The MedTech sector in Ireland generates circa 12 bn in exports annually and employs 32,000 people in Ireland. The global telemedicine market size was estimated at USD $41.4 bn in 2019.</p><p>Arguably, the transformation hitting the headlines now is not as a result of any new vison or new technology alone, but more interestingly is a result of a transformative shift in mindset.</p><p>Historically, there has been a real reluctance to adopt new technologies in healthcare. The contrast to the rates of adoption in communications or retail is stark. Patients have been slow to opt for innovation over traditional person-to-person care.  Doctors worry about technology failures caused by outages or simple human input error.  Going digital creates extra work, familiarizing oneself with new technology in an overstretched care environment with systems that work \"well enough\". Within the existing infrastructure, investment in digital is rarely a priority.  Hospital administrators are reluctant to spend tight budgets on cutting edge technology, if neither patient nor physician are likely to change their behavior and adopt it.</p><p>The Corona Virus pandemic has been a gamechanger, compelling both patient and physician to use technology advances to facilitate their treatment. It is this culture shift that will accelerate the role of technology in health care. Increased adoption will drive further investment and encourage innovation.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>Year over year, Q2 2020 saw a surge of over 22% in VC investment in life sciences with a quarterly high of USD $7.8bn.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In the UK, Dr. Doctor's video consultation portal solution and Intouch's integrated virtual clinics management platform, which were scheduled for release in late 2020, accelerated their development and launched earlier this year to alleviate pressure on NHS hospitals as they struggled to cope with managing and treating patients during the pandemic.  By connecting the portal to the platform, patients can now manage their appointments, launch video consultations, complete digital assessment forms and check in for their in-person appointment all from home.   The potential for this technology is only just being explored, prompting the CEO of Guys and St. Thomas, NHS Trust to encourage colleagues to \"come and see the system live and consider what it can do in your practice\".<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>Medtechnews.com 4 June 2020</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>While this digital shift is to be encouraged for the efficiencies and personalised care it enables, if, as we suggest, it is being driven by people as much as technology, then it is vital that it is managed and regulated in a way which builds patient and physician trust while avoiding unnecessary dampeners on innovation.</p><p>Paul Reid Director General of the HSE commented in a Business Post article Sunday August 9 2020 that Covid 19 has fast tracked reforms in the Irish health system that may have taken years to happen otherwise.</p><p>Paul Reid is eager, he said, to run with this momentum and recognise the new world we are living in, focusing on actions, targeted to give a bigger impact:  \"Anything that involved tele-health and community services needs to be accelerated\" along with \"the development of community-based healthcare\".</p><p>Technology is at the core of these objectives. However, the development and roll out of these technologies is not straightforward. There are many twists and turns ahead before we successfully reimagine healthcare delivery.</p><p>The real catalysts may be the shift in mindset, the culture change, the desire and state of readiness to be part of a system exploring new ways of doing more with less in a patient centric way.  That perhaps is the real transformation coming from the pandemic and not the technology itself.</p><p>If this is indeed the case (and there is evidence to suggest it is), then Paul Reid should focus first on the people at the centre of this \"new world\"; the patient, the physician, the innovator. He should ask them what it will take to ensure they feel secure enough to swop face-to-face for screen-to-screen consultation and treatment; what will enable them to trust the AI delivered analytics; and what will incentivise them to innovate for a better healthcare system.</p><p>A 2019 digital risk report and  white paper RSA Digital Risk in Healthcare Today 2019 identified the major risks emerging from digital transformation in the healthcare sector.</p><p>These risks include:</p><p>Cyber-attack</p><p>In the US in 2019 healthcare was one of the top two industries most targeted by cyber threats<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Statista - 5 August 2019.</p></bodyText></footnote> As wearables, apps, sensors, robotics, monitors and implants make up the internet of medical things and as they are deployed to a myriad of users across many different platforms,  they are very vulnerable to cyber-attack. Cyber security threats remain the biggest drawback to increased digitalisation in healthcare. Investment in robust data security systems and blockchain technologies will be as important a driver of digital health as wearable devices and mobile monitors.</p><p>Data Privacy</p><p>In the two years between 2016 and 2018, healthcare data grew 878% and it was expected (pre pandemic) that by the end of this year at least 25% of all healthcare data will be collected by the patient themselves.  While GDPR sets the ground rules for regulating data privacy and in particular special category data such as healthcare data, risk management practices must keep pace with digital transformation efforts.  As healthcare workers provide care from multiple locations, they require secure and rapid access to information by mobile and web based applications and in so doing risk exposing healthcare organisations to improper use and access.</p><p>AI and Data Analytics</p><p>Quality machine learning requires quality data.  Biased data can lead to biased models and algorithms that function differently in different populations.  Given the breadth of machine learning uses across healthcare, the breadth of techniques in use and the breadth of data and human involvement, the requirement for any given machine-learning algorithm depends heavily on the context.  Opacity in machine learning may impair our ability to assess medical devices safety and effectiveness. Where machine learning constantly retrains using incremental learning from streaming data, we need to be able to assess the safety and effectiveness of these models in real time.</p><p>While AI is not explicitly mentioned in the GDPR, many of its provisions are relevant to the use of AI.  However, there are tensions emerging between traditional data protection principles such as purpose limitation and data minimization and the full deployment of the powers of AI. In addition, a number of AI related data protection issues are not addressed in the GDPR. Controllers and processors are calling for additional guidance. The Scientific Foresight Unit (European Parliament June 2020) has called for a broad social, political and legal debate on what standards should apply to processing of personal data using AI. The debate, it is felt, should also address what applications should be barred and which may be admitted under specific circumstances and controls.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>If building momentum around the acceleration of digital health technologies is the goal the government, the HSE and the private sector must focus on the management, mitigation and regulation of risk areas so as to build trust across the human network as much as the enablement of the technology itself.</p><p>If the transformation in healthcare has in fact been accelerated not just by technology but by people and their willingness to adapt and adopt, the continuation of this transformation toward a future vision of \"being consumer centric, efficient and based on high quality data and accessible technology\" depends on our ability to build and maintain trust in the new healthcare infrastructure. Big Tech has shown us too many examples of what can happen when trust is an afterthought, a nice to have when everything else is in place, for us to let it happen in healthcare when it is truly a matter of life or death.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The Report is the second report under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and is the first report based on a full calendar year under the GDPR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2019 statistics</p><p>The Report reveals 2019 has been an exceptionally busy year for the DPC. It contains a number of interesting statistics, in particular:</p><p> Complaints: 7,215 complaints received; 75% increase from 2018; 29% in access rights category; 5,496 complaints concluded, and 457 cross-border processing complaints received through the One-Stop Shop mechanismBreaches: 6,069 valid data breach notifications received; 71% increase from 2018 and 83% related to unauthorised disclosuresInquiries: 70 inquiries as of 31 December 2019; 21 cross-border inquiries, and 49 domestic inquiriesDirect marketing: 165 new complaints investigated; 77 related to email marketing; 81 related to SMS marketing; seven related to telephone marketing, and prosecutions concluded against four entitiesGeneral consultation queries: 1,420 queries received; 44% from the private/financial sector, and 33% from the public sectorData Protection Officers: 712 new Data Protection Officer notifications, bringing the total number to 1,596 at year endContacts: 22,300 emails; 22,200 telephone call, and almost 4,000 items of post.Staff: increase from 110 at the end of 2018 to 140 at the end of 2019Communications and guidance: 33 guidance documents, 18 blogs, 8 podcasts, 20,000 social media followersBinding Corporate Rules: lead reviewer in 19 Binding Corporate Rules applications</p><p>Summary of key sections</p><p>Complaints</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number of complaints received. As in previous years, access requests complaints were identified as the highest complaint-type received by the DPC between in 2019 - 2,064 complaints. A high proportion of these related to the failure of organisations to respond to an access request, or failure to release all the appropriate data on foot of an access request.</p><p>The DPC is the lead supervisory authority for a broad range of multinationals and the Report sets out that 457 cross-border complaints were transferred to the DPC by other data protection supervisory authorities in 2019.</p><p>Breaches</p><p>Some of the trends and issues related to breaches identified in the Report include:</p><p> Late notificationsDifficulty in assessing risk ratingsFailure to communicate the breach to individualsRepeat breach notificationsInadequate reporting</p><p>There has been an increase in the number of repeat breaches of a similar nature by a large number of companies, particularly in the financial sector, where the majority of breaches appear to be related to unauthorised disclosures.</p><p>Inquiries</p><p>Investigations into big tech companies continued to progress in 2019 with the first two inquiries moving from the investigative stage to the decision-making phase. The Report states that it is going to take time to implement the new legal frameworks under the GDPR but assures readers that intensive work is underway. The Report anticipates that 2020 will involve the reconciliation of many such complex legal issues which will flow from the conclusion of its first waves of statutory inquiries and the crystallisation in practical terms of many theoretical legal and procedural issues which have been raised during those first novel inquiries.</p><p>Cookies</p><p>In 2019, the DPC examined the use of cookies and similar technologies on a selection of websites across a range of sectors, including media and publishing, the retail sector, restaurants and food ordering services, insurance, sport and leisure and the public sector. The Report states that the quality of information provided to users in relation to cookies varied widely and confirms that during 2020, the DPC will produce updated guidance on cookies and other technologies. The Report notes that the DPC will place a strong focus on compliance in this area.</p><p>Children</p><p>The Report informs us that the DPC is now finalising its guidance document on children's data protection rights and the processing of children's data having carried out an extensive consultation on the processing of children's personal data.  In tandem with the guidance, the DPC will publish a separate child-friendly guide which will explain to children their rights under data protection law and the risks that may arise when they disclose their personal data online.</p><p>Regulatory Strategy 2020-2025</p><p>Among the DPC's key projects in the Report is its Regulatory Strategy 2020-2025. The DPC commenced consultations last year to understand people's views on data protection rights, the role of the DPC, how compliance with data protection law should be encouraged, facilitated, and maximised, and how non-compliance should be regulated. The draft Regulatory Strategy is being developed and will be subject to a further open public consultation during 2020.</p><p>Case studies and litigation</p><p>The Report contains various case studies and details of litigation the DPC is involved in.

The report by the European Commission, seen by Reuters, sought to assess the effectiveness of the EU's landmark data privacy rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted in 2018. GDPR requires companies to seek people's consent before using their personal data or face steep fines. European Vice President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova has previously lauded the rules as a compass to guide the EU into the digital age. </p><p>The report said that data protection agencies across the 27-country bloc had increased staff by 42per cent increase and budgets by 49per cent between 2016-2019, but the Irish and Luxembourg governments needed to do more. \"Given that the largest big tech multinationals are established in Ireland and Luxembourg, the data protection authorities of these countries act as lead authorities in many important cross-border cases and may need larger resources than their population would otherwise suggest,\" the report said. The Irish watchdog has opened cases into Facebook, Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Twitter, Apple, Verizon Media, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast. The report urged national watchdogs to launch joint investigations that would lead to more harmonised rules and approaches. It said some of the challenges were reconciling data privacy rights with the right to freedom of expression, and how to apply the rules to technologies such as artificial intelligence, facial recognition, blockchain and the internet of things. Enforcement continues to be the weak link, said Eva Simon at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe. \"There are still far too many governments, organisations and businesses flouting the rules,\" she said.

The public finances have been repaired, economic activity and employment are growing, and financial stability has been restored.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ireland was the fastest-growing economy in the EU last year, and the European Commission forecasts the same again this year. GDP in Ireland grew by 4.8 per cent in 2014.  This is the strongest year of annual GDP growth since 2007.</p><p>Economic growth is now broadly balanced.  Exports are contributing to growth due to competitiveness gains and the domestic economy is now contributing to growth once again.</p><p>The economic recovery to date is, in large part, due to the considerable improvement in competitiveness that has taken place in recent years.</p><p>Prices and labour costs have grown less in Ireland than in our trading partners.  Combined with the recent depreciation of the euro, this has seen Ireland\u2019s competitiveness \u2013 as measured by the real effective exchange rate - recover most of the deterioration recorded during the boom years.</p><p>This recovery in national competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradable sectors of the economy.  Exports are now at an all-time high.  Ireland has been particularly successful in expanding its share of the world\u2019s services market in recent years and services now account for approximately half of total exports from Ireland.</p><p>While the indicators are heading in the right direction we cannot afford to be complacent.</p><p>The theme of today\u2019s event only serves to remind that it is important to retain real gains in competiveness not just for the sake of the development of the financial services sector but also to ensure the continued development of the wider economy.</p><p>IFS 2020 Strategy</p><p>Given the theme of the conference, I will initially address some points in respect of the IFS 2020 Strategy.</p><p>It is clear that Ireland has been a success in attracting financial services investment and in recent times growing our own companies who can compete on the world stage.</p><p>The sector now employs 35,000 people with a third of those outside Dublin. The importance of the sector in providing sustainable employment across all the State is well recognised.</p><p>The Government recognises its importance and engages with a view to ensuring that we retain existing business and employment and grow future employment.</p><p>Despite its success financial services in Ireland finds itself at an important juncture.</p><p>It is an increasingly a competitive sector and there is global competition for financial services investment.</p><p>We are faced with a more competitive period for financial services investment than ever.</p><p>However, it seems to me that there are many criteria on which financial services companies base the location of their activity. These can be issues such as</p><p>    taxation<br/>    availability of physical and technological infrastructure<br/>    availability of skilled staff<br/>    level and scale of financial technological innovation<br/>    regulatory environment/government and political stability<br/>    access to customers<br/>    access to suppliers<br/>    costs<br/>    culture and quality of life<br/>    size of specific markets (e.g. China)</p><p>The importance of these will vary according to the sector and financial service activity.</p><p>It is important for us to be as competitive as possible in as many of these factors as we can to develop the financial services sector.</p><p>However, we also need to understand the markets in which we want to be active \u2013 where they add additional business activity, revenue and employment and align our efforts to being competitive in those markets \u2013 whether they are in terms of either inward investments or exports.</p><p>The IFS 2020 strategy is our statement that we intend to remain competitive for financial services investment.</p><p>It is also a statement of intent in terms of the sectors we are seeking to support and develop.</p><p>The IFS 2020 strategy seeks to ensure that we protect the progress that has been made but to also to develop further as we recognise that we cannot stand still.</p><p>This strategy allows us to make choices in terms of the financial services sectors we can support and nurture.</p><p>In terms of vision for the Strategy we want to be recognised as a global location of choice for specialised international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client service while focusing on capturing on new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.</p><p>The strategy places an emphasis on aligning and co-ordinating the marketing and branding of the IFS sector.</p><p>There will be greater use of the embassy and consulate network in sharpening our regional focus as well as targeted trade missions. Conferences such as this one and the IFS conference planned for early 2016 demonstrate our intention to support the sector.</p><p>Further targeted engagement internationally can have the benefit of attracting investment to Ireland and selling the offering we have in Ireland as a location for financial services.</p><p>One of the important proposals in IFS 2020 is engaging with the capital markets union process. Securing more funding for the real economy is an important objective of this ambitious initiative (Capital Markets Union), which will run from 2015 to 2019. CMU, through a wide ranging series of initiatives, aims to make EU capital markets more integrated, liquid and competitive.</p><p>Its ultimate purpose is to increase resilience of the financial system and provide greater opportunities for SMEs and longer term infrastructure projects. From an Irish perspective CMU could serve to significantly increase issuer and investor access to more liquid European markets and, in so doing, enable our companies to expand and create employment.</p><p>The broad aim of the process is to</p><p>    Increase funding for business<br/>    Create more opportunities for investors<br/>    Encourage cross border investment</p><p>I doubt there is anyone in the room who would disagree with the aim of the CMU.</p><p>I was at a discussion of CMU last week in Brussels.</p><p>I am very impressed at the vigour of the Commission and Commissioner (Lord) Hill in bringing the CMU process forward.</p><p>I commend Commissioner (Lord) Hill on his work.</p><p>It is heartening to hear that 9 per cent of the total submissions to the consultation process initiated by the European Commission came from Ireland which shows the level of interest and involvement from the financial sector in this country.</p><p>The approach being adopted by the Commission is to combine long term ambitions with short term early actions.</p><p>This is I think is a useful approach and allows for \u201cquick wins\u201d to be achieved.</p><p>We want to be in a position to be able to benefit from any opportunities that emerge from the CMU process.</p><p>Realising the growth potential of the IFS sector relies to a large extent on the availability of high quality education and skills. Ireland already has a high skilled workforce.</p><p>The IFS sector is competing with other sectors, including domestic FS employers and leading multinational corporations, for graduates in disciplines such as ICT, engineering, mathematics, data analytics, business and law. This competition for talent has been accentuated in more recent years as the convergence between ICT and IFS has accelerated.</p><p>The Strategy seeks to address this though a number of different processes with the aim of ensuring that there is availability of the relevant talents and qualifications to ensure that your business can thrive in Ireland.</p><p>Another important goal of the Strategy is to drive research, innovation and entrepreneurship in the IFS sector.</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s leading and emerging technology and financial services companies have strategic international operations in Ireland. But Ireland is also establishing a strong global reputation for innovative FinTech start-ups. The start-up rate for Irish-owned FinTech companies is accelerating rapidly. As a result Ireland, along with the UK, captures most of the FinTech venture investment occurring in Europe.</p><p>Our big tech and big data advantages are many. The company listings, spanning Apple to Zynga, reads like a who's who in the ICT hall of fame. While Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple setting up data centres across the country prove that Irish clouds really do have a silver lining.</p><p>We have recently seen Realex acquired by Global Payments for \u20ac115m and Currency Fair raising \u20ac10m on the markets to fund their further expansion.</p><p>We are seeing significant investment and enthusiasm around the Fintech sector. This is a valuable niche in the international marketplace Ireland can really put its stamp on. Taking on the mantle of a premier global Fintech hub is an opportunity that requires an alignment and leveraging of the many advantages Ireland has worked long and hard to achieve.</p><p>The changes arising in the provision of financial services from the technological changes are transformative.</p><p>Indeed I was at an event in Frankfurt last week to support Irish financial technology companies in their efforts to win business in the German market. I was impressed at the dedication and level of skills and commercial acumen I saw and hope to see more of such events.</p><p>Indeed, the IFS 2020 Strategy contains a number of actions to help ensure we have an effective Fintech ecosystem which addresses the needs of start-ups and scaling companies in terms of funding, skills, mentors, accelerators while at the same time addressing the needs of foreign-owned IFS multinationals. The ultimate aim is to make Ireland a global leader for Fintech.</p><p>Regulation and IFS 2020</p><p>Ensuring that the operating environment remains transparent and competitive is a key factor that will underpin the strategy\u2019s success.</p><p>It is important to note the Central Bank\u2019s independent role in terms of regulation. This is vital to ensure confidence in the regulation of the financial services sector in Ireland.  We have had too many problems in the past for this to change.</p><p>However I would say that the IFS2020 Strategy should improve the alignment and line of sight between all the important stakeholders, which does, of course, include the Central Bank</p><p>The Central Bank have publicly published authorisation standard reports that benchmarks their performance against operational and other targets. The issuance of those reports allows for consultation and feedback from industry and the public, allowing for greater transparency and dialogue between the policy makers and the IFS sector at large.</p><p>It is always useful to consider the level or implementation of standards. It allows for a new evaluation of how standards are developed and implemented \u2013 this of course does not mean a diminution in standards.</p><p>As the financial services sector evolves and changes, the regulators and the policy makers cannot stand still. Where it is possible to make changes to improve the quality but also the transparency of the regulatory process, we should aim to do so as much as possible. Greater transparency in processes can however lead to improved accountability and acceptance and understanding of regulation and regulatory processes.</p><p>In that context and as part of the IFS 2020 strategy the Central Bank and the Department of Finance are, in accordance with their respective legal roles, to review the authorisation service standards reported by the Central Bank this year.</p><p>I think this will be a useful and productive exercise and complement the other measures in the strategy.</p><p>Implementation</p><p>Clearly all the aims in IFS 2020 will not be achieved without an appropriate implementation process.</p><p>The implementation structures of IFS 2020 with a high level group chaired by me and involving both the public sector and private industry should ensure that issues within and ancillary to the Strategy are considered and prioritised for action.  This will allow for issues of interest to be considered by the sector.</p><p>In addition, the Strategy is intended to be flexible to cope with the challenges to be addressed. Indeed, an important part of the approach in dealing with the Strategy is the recognition that it will change and evolve over the next five years.</p><p>The implementation structure involving the public sector and industry in problem solving mode in tandem with the flexible nature of the strategy is in my view a way of achieving positive outcomes for all financial services providers and for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The theme of today\u2019s event is Strategically Positioning IFS.</p><p>I believe that the financial services sector in Ireland faces and will continue to face challenges. There are local, national and global competitive challenges which we must and will face.</p><p>We have a strong competitive position but we cannot afford to stand still. The IFS strategy is part of the process of remaining competitive now and in the future.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-EUN3483184</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G78-V4X1-DXCW-D43J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 15, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Her centrepiece business policies would define the epoch for certain companies located here. As she strides to the front of the Democrat field, what is Ireland's plan for Warren?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leaked audio this week from an internal Facebook meeting included a promise by its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to fight Warren's anti-monopoly plans to \"break up Big Tech\" should she reach the White House. She has specifically threatened to go after Facebook, Google and Amazon, which all have major operations in Dublin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said, in the comments leaked to theverge.com. \"If someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><h>Fight With an officially-claimed 15,000 Irish jobs at the three companies combined, the Government would feel it had a dog in that fight. Which dog, is the question.</h><p>Here is Ireland's Warren quandary: Big Tech might be a big employer here, but she is completely correct about the need to rein in Facebook, Google and Amazon. With a combined market cap of $2.1 trillion (EUR 1.9 trillion) they are too big and powerful to adequately regulate. It is an economic and social imperative that they be broken up, even though that could damage their ability to invest in Ireland.</p><p>If it's not Warren, it will be somebody else eventually. If US or EU sheriffs come to bust up Big Tech, Ireland, as their international home (in the case of Facebook and Google) and regulatory safe harbour, must decide - play along or play the fool? The State's international reputation was sullied for being on the wrong side of history over corporate tax avoidance. Ireland cannot afford to be the bad guy yet again, if this State appeared to back anything other than the international greater good.</p><p>Warren's thesis on Big Tech is straightforward. She argues that Google, Facebook and Amazon, by dint of their scale and ability to kill off competitors, as well as their vast troves of data, have too much power over economies, societies, and democracies.</p><p>\"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\" she wrote in March. Outside of Mountainview, Menlo Park and Seattle, and perhaps Silicon Docks in Dublin, who could argue against her while keeping a straight face?</p><p>Warren cites an eMarketer claim that Amazon was on course for 50 per cent of the US e-commerce market by the end of 2018, eight times the share of its nearest rival, eBay. Meanwhile, Facebook's terrifying power is illustrated in the blame it gets for facilitating bad actors to influence elections, such is its omnipresence. As for Google, when is the last time you even contemplated using another search engine? The rest are pygmies and will remain so, which makes Google competitively immovable.</p><p>\"As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests [of society],\" Warren argues, with some justification.</p><p>She says Big Tech companies have used mergers to limit competition, such as Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp. She also accuses them of a conflict of interest by controlling \"proprietary marketplaces\" or trading platforms, such as Amazon Marketplace, while at the same time participating in the platforms as sellers against other competitors.</p><p>Firstly, Warren proposes passing laws to designate major tech companies with trading marketplaces as \"platform utilities\". They would be forced to hive off their own trading arms from the platforms, to ensure their own businesses didn't get favourable treatment. She'd also ban them from sharing data with each other.</p><p>\"Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well,\" she says.</p><p>Secondly, she says she would appoint regulators to unwind Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp; Google's buyouts of Waze, Next and DoubleClick; and Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos.</p><p>\"Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market, which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\" she argues. Imagine Facebook and Instagram as competitors trying to outdo each other to protect their users' data?</p><p>If Warren topples Trump and takes the White House, it would present a genuine dilemma for Ireland, were she to follow through with her plans.</p><h>Cuddle up </h><p>The Government has made a strategic choice to cuddle up to Google and Facebook, in particular. One has only to read the cringe-worthy exchanges of mutual fawning between Leo Varadkar and Zuckerberg, released recently under Freedom of Information.</p><p>Yet it's easy to say he should have given Zuckerberg hell for the negative attention Facebook has brought on Ireland for its exotic tax practices and its management of user data. But he can't just tell such a large employer to take a hike. Arguably, given Facebook's level of investment, the Taoiseach was merely acting in the immediate national interest. So long as he doesn't forget Ireland's long-term interests.</p><p>Whatever about Amazon, if Google and Facebook are broken up, the landscape will change on Silicon Docks.</p><h>Footnote </h><p>The announcement of the impending elevation of little-known Corkman Ken Murphy to the top job at Tesco, as group chief executive, had many in the City of London's Square Mile scratching their heads.</p><p>When he takes over next summer, he will have big shoes to fill as the replacement for \"Drastic\" Dave Lewis (inset), whom one analyst said on Wednesday will be forever known as the \"bloke who saved Tesco\" from obliteration by the grocery discounters.</p><p>They know Murphy well at Munster rugby club, however. When the club put together a commercial advisory board of big hitters in the dog days of 2012, the former Walgreens Boots Alliance chief commercial officer was one of those to whom it turned. Until he moved to the US four years ago, Murphy served alongside prominent names such as Digicel's Leslie Buckley and Greencore's Patrick Coveney.</p><p>Munster's commercial board is chaired by the business blue-blood Niall FitzGerald, the former chairman and chief executive of Unilever, a rival of Procter &amp; Gamble where Murphy started his career in consumer goods.</p><p>Boots, where Murphy soldiered for most of his career, would have been a client of Greencore's sandwich supply business. By all accounts, it was Greencore's Coveney and FitzGerald who identified the Corkman to come on board at Munster. Murphy was also seemingly a handy rugby player in his day, and played for Munster at underage level.</p><p>His former Munster colleagues were impressed and say Murphy brought innovative ideas to the table. He is said to have been especially influential in pushing Munster to seek commercial tie-ups with educational institutions.</p><p>When US giant Walgreens took full control of Boots Alliance in 2015, Murphy, who had been based in Nottingham, moved to Chicago for a senior role and left the Munster commercial board. He didn't cut his links with the club entirely, however, and has been spotted about the place for big games.</p><p>He quit his US job last December and moved his family back across the Atlantic, although he kept a consultancy role at Walgreeens.</p><p>Company records show he set up an Irish company, along with his wife Olga, a few days before Christmas, called Mistletonia. It subsequently changed its name to Retail &amp; Consumer Insights, and remains registered to a Donnybrook, Dublin 4 address. Surely that must be considered behind enemy lines for a Munster man? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4039578</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X68-4W11-DYS1-0220-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last year over a million people from Ireland visited Spain, more than France, Italy and Portugal combined. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From a low base 20 years ago, Irish-managed companies are now doing very well here. Ryanair is the number one airline in Spain in terms of passenger traffic, and 8.2 million people in Spain have bought something in Primark, more than even the Spanish home-grown Zara. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet to those of us living here long enough to be well integrated can detect a low level of anger towards Ireland both in government and among the Spanish public. I will give two examples. </p><p>A banker told me that Ireland was increasingly seen as place you could issue debt when the banks in Spain will not lend you any more money. \"They should have had to sell assets, but you lot gave him more money.\" </p><p>An executive from Sareb, Spain's bad bank, complained about the highly favourable terms offered to private equity firms by Nama. \"No euro zone country should be falling over like that to help those guys,\" he said. </p><p>In technology circles the anger is even greater, with start-ups losing their technical staff to the bright lights of Silicon Docks in Dublin and elsewhere. Any defence that Ireland just created the right investment climate is given short shrift. </p><p>\"Those big tech companies are only there as you allow them to transfer most of the profits from around Europe\" </p><p>If you are used to the words Irish and Ireland bringing nothing but a great big smile, such treatment can be quite a jolt.</p><p>There is no great Boston or Berlin debate in Spain. Rich and poor alike expect high-quality public services in health, education and transport. Many people who have private healthcare through their employer prefer to use the public system. Similarly, many parents I know send their children to public school, dismissing any notion that private is automatically better. </p><p>While centre-right politicians here express their admiration for (and even name streets after) Margaret Thatcher, they do not share her antipathy towards the role of the state. Over the last five years the government led by prime minister <person><nameText>Mariano Rajoy </nameText></person>has cut education and health spending by EUR 16 billion. At just over 1 per cent of GDP it is not an insignificant figure but he did not dare to cut it by more.</p><h>Reluctance</h><p>Up to now populist ire for the cuts has been directed towards the continued existence of special investment vehicles that allow the wealthy to avoid taxes. However, the outcome of the EU Commission investigation into Apple has highlighted the Irish Government's reluctance to, at the very least, ask more questions of foreign multinationals.  </p><p>This week in the European Parliament, Spanish EPP MEP Pablo Zalba Bidegain said: \"We must say loud and clear that the party is over. Although multinationals create jobs, they must pay taxes and we need a consolidated tax basis.\" </p><p>Also members of the EPP are Fine Gael MEPs Brian Hayes and Sean Kelly, both of whom spoke in opposition to the ruling. </p><p>An old joke among the major oil companies is that in Spain it is not possible to know where the energy company Repsol ends and where the ministry for energy begins. The same could be said for the other large utilities on the IBEX35 such as Telefonica, Iberdrola and Endesa. </p><p>Although private companies, they are seen as having strategic national importance. In exchange for having their interests always taken into consideration, they are expected to pay their fair share of corporation tax. </p><p>They do, of course, take measures to reduce the burden, but never to minimise it to anything near the 0.005 per cent Apple paid on its European profits in 2014. </p><p>The image of Ireland has been dragged by association into the world of the Panama Papers, Lux Leaks and the Lagarde list. </p><p>It did not help that the Irish Government rushed so forcefully to Apple's defence. Something more nuanced like \"while we support Apple's decision to appeal the ruling, we also support the amendment to Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) to ensure that large groups publish annually a report disclosing the profit and the tax accrued and paid in each member state on a country-by-country basis\" would have gone down better in Madrid and Brussels.</p><h>Tremendous benefit </h><p>Is there any argument but that our membership of Europe has been of tremendous benefit to Ireland, and that the Atlanticist Fantasy of our nearest neighbour is not a credible alternative?  </p><p>Brexit means that the era of Ireland riding two horses as the acceptable face of the Anglo Saxon world is over. </p><p>The UK saying \"cheerio\" means we will have to get on board with an agenda of closer integration or continue to have more days as a lonely minority as Hayes and Kelly had this week.</p><p>This will not be easy. As a nation we like to be friends with everyone. We are not good at taking sides. However, as both my Latin American and African students remind me, some of the things people like most about the Irish are our ability to side with little guy against injustice. </p><p>The EU has its faults, but we should be in there fighting to ensure that corporations pay tax where they generate profits, that justice is done in public and not by secret investor courts, and that companies in breach of consumer regulations lose access to EU markets. </p><p>Many a political career in Ireland was derailed over doubts as to whether he or she was \"sound on the national question\". </p><p>Maybe now it is time we should rephrase the question, and ask if he or she is \"sound on the European question\"?

Unless you told it not to track <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">that </emphasis>location data, managed in the Web &amp; App Activity section, separate to the Location History section.\u00a0</p><p>So, thanks to this befuddling arrangement and the opaque semantics of Google- ese, \"do not track location\" means \"do not track except when we want to track you and haven't told you clearly that we still track when you almost certainly have assumed your choice to toggle off location tracking meant we no longer tracked and stored your location. But we do.\"\u00a0</p><p>Let's be clear here: there is absolutely no reason why this should be a camouflaged, two-tiered process, and every reason - including some compelling legal ones - it should not.\u00a0Don't even countenance that favourite big tech slippery slope argument that such data gathering is a fair trade for a \"free service\" and that if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about (supposedly) benign data gathering anyway.\u00a0</p><p>First off, an operating system on a phone or tablet is not a \"free service\" - it is the necessary code needed for the device to function at all. To have an obscure default setting allowing data gathering by the device itself as it operates, and making that data gathering a necessary part of Android's functioning, is outrageous.\u00a0</p><p>Second, Google already has the (lucrative) ability to serve you ads when you use its services. Grabbing location data is not a required part of this process. But location data allows far more targeted and therefore even more lucrative (for Google) ads and promotions.\u00a0</p><h>Creepy timeline That's good for Google, but is it good for you? Location data generates a rich and revealing - and creepy - timeline of an individual's location, activities and inter- actions with apps and services. History has repeatedly shown such data troves can be exploited and misused, are always vulnerable to hackers, and - as a stored permanent record - may be sold on</h><p> or used in the future in ways we cannot foresee now.\u00a0</p><p>Many people, once aware of the extent of such detailed tracking, wish to turn it off. Not because they have anything to hide, but because they have an innate sense of, and internationally recognised human right to, privacy.\u00a0</p><p>But there are far wider implications to what Google has been doing here. In the US, such tracking may well constitute deceptive privacy practices under the Federal Trade Commission's consumer protection regulations. Facebook fell afoul of those and had to come to a settlement in 2011 with the commission, which is now investigating if the Cambridge Analytica scandal violated that agreement.</p><p>In response to the AP report, the commission's former chief technologist Ashkan Soltani\u00a0tweeted that this\u00a0\"confusing privacy dialogue\" from Google \"may land another @FTC inquiry\". It's particularly hard to see how Google's practices are allowable under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>\"Google's carelessness about location tracking is a breach of GDPR pure and simple,\" says Daragh O Brien, a GDPR expert and managing director of information management consultants Castlebridge. He believes Google may be exposed to punishments under the legislation.</p><p>\"[Google] ignored individuals' explicit choices. Given the scale of individuals affected, the overriding of opt-outs and the potential sensitivity of data, this would be at the upper end of the GDPR fines scale,\" he says.</p><p>\"The Irish Data Protection Commissioner [Helen Dixon] should act on behalf of Irish Android users - which would include civil servants, government ministers and garda\u00ed with 'official' phones - and they will be the lead regulator in any EU enforcement action given Ireland is Google's EU headquarters.\"</p><p>As O Brien suggests, Google's activities will place the Irish office of the Data Protection Commissioner under international scrutiny as it steps into its critical, daunting role as the principal regulator for these massive and too often impenetrable and imperious multinationals.</p><p>In the face of Google's size and its armies of lawyers, can Ireland fulfil this role? Put it this way: the commissioner has far greater resources from the Government now, and therefore has potential, but so far not enough form.</p><p>Says O Brien: \"We are waiting six months for the telegraphed release of their investigation into the Public Services Card and no action has been taken regarding unlawful roll-outs of CCTV schemes in rural areas. This investigation would be joining a queue.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3597788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-71J1-DYS1-03X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 16, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Personal Data</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTBCRTA2NEEzNDIzNDlBRThCNTNCMThGNkI0NUI5ODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTJENDFFOTRERkUzNEM4RUFDNTJEQTY3QjQ1MDk5MzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Personal Data</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTBCRTA2NEEzNDIzNDlBRThCNTNCMThGNkI0NUI5ODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkMzMDZEOTJBNDU2NEI5OUEyRUUwOEYxNERGRDgzRjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DF8W</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY VULNERABILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001702</classCode><className>TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CF4G</classCode><className>TABLET COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DFHG</classCode><className>MOBILE DEVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The preliminary order could have massive ramifications on Facebook's operations in the EU, with the tech giant being fined if it fails to comply with the decree.In July, the European Court of Justice issued new restrictions for companies that store data of EU residents on American servers. </p><p>The EU's top court said that data transfers to the U.S.could violate the privacy of Europeans and subject their information to U.S. surveillance.The July ruling invalidated a data transfer mechanism known as the U.S.- EU Privacy Shield. The mechanism offers legal protection for transatlantic transfers of EU data and is relied on by major tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook.In May 2018, the EU implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[2], which requires businesses to protect personal data. Big tech companies have been forced to rework their user privacy policies since the regulation was introduced.In February, Google announced[3] that users in the U.K. would lose EU data protection, and would be put under U.S. jurisdiction. The decision was due to the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU.Big tech companies have also faced privacy troubles in the U.S. In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined[4] Facebook $5 billion due to data privacy violations.

As the Anglo Irish Bank trial ended, with considerable criticism from the judge for the former financial regulator, another court case began scrutinising another regulator: the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was not a trial but a judicial review. The question before the High Court: was the DPC right not to probe allegations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Dublin subsidiary may have passed on data of its European users to the US intelligence services?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the Prism programme, launched by the US National Security Agency (NSA) in 2007 and exposed by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis> newspaper last summer, US companies are obliged to turn over data that meets court-approved search terms. The NSA says the programme had prevented terrorism and operated under full judicial oversight. Whether European data was involved is unclear.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When asked to investigate further by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, the Data Protection Commissioner, Billy Hawkes, ruled that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Prism transfers were covered by existing EU-US data agreements, so were beyond his remit and required no further attention.</p><p>This week's court date to challenge his ruling was not the first encounter between Hawkes and Schrems, but it was by far the most public. For years the Austrian has demanded that the commissioner's office investigate a company he views as a disingenuous data magpie that collects more information than it lets on and that he believes runs rings around the Irish regulator.</p><p>After two audits of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>International, the DPC says the social-networking company is compliant with European data laws.</p><p>This latest battle between Schrems and Hawkes ensures the final ruling on June 18th of Mr Justice Gerard Hogan, who specialises in constitutional and EU law, will find a broad audience around Europe.</p><p>Watching closely are data-protection regulators around the continent, many unhappy that they must defer to Hawkes's office on complaints their citizens make against <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and other tech companies based in the State.</p><p>Such cross-border disputes expose the divergent views, legal traditions and cultural expectations around Europe about privacy. Tempers flare and misunderstandings abound.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twenty-year-old rules</emphasis>Britain's information commissioner believes Hawkes does a good job in very difficult legal circumstances. Until a new European data-protection directive that is- currently being negotiated  comes into force, all national data-protection bodies process complaints based on national interpretations of 20-year-old rules written before the emergence of Google and <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>\"Under the current legal regime,\" says David Smith, Britain's deputy information commissioner, \"we cannot be expected to apply other countries' legal standards across the board to cases that affect their citizens but also ours.\"</p><p>Germany's federal and state data-protection commissioners are perhaps the most vocal - and negative - in Europe about the DPC. They all express respect for their Irish colleague but doubt the Data Protection Commissioner would ever take on a deep-pocketed multinational like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in the courts.</p><p>\"The problem we have with <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is that it appears to have chosen a location where not only the tax but also the data-protection regime suits its business practices,\" says Johannes Caspar, data protection regulator in Hamburg, suggesting that decisions by the DPC are friendlier to business than they would be elsewhere.</p><p>Asked for an example, Caspar cites a dispute about <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>facial-recognition feature, developed to automatically name-tag people in photographs that users upload. </p><p>According to <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>the Irish regulator found that the tag-suggest feature is legally compliant. The Irish DPC found the feature was compliant if additional information was provided to users, while German regulators said it was highly problematic for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to scan and digitally measure faces for a private biometric database - a resource that, in future, could potentially be requested for surveillance.</p><p>Hawkes accepts there was fundamental agreement on this point but says his office engaged with European authorities to find a consensual agreement.</p><p>\"We see this as an endorsement of our co-operative approach, involving all of our colleagues taking in their concerns,\" he says. Facebok eventually abolished the feature and deleted the database for European users, but Hamburg's data protection commissioner Johannes Caspar believes the feature would still be operational if it had not been for European regulators' intervention. \"<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>eventually rowed back on this after our offices opened an administrative procedure\" against them, he says.</p><p>Other German data-protection officials worry the DPC office, in Portarlington, is too small to monitor the tech giants clustered around Grand Canal Dock.</p><p>\"Billy Hawkes does his best, but why is he expected to take on a plane like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>with a catapult?\" says Joachim Wahlbrink, data-protection commissioner in Lower Saxony. \"Not being adequately resourced shows me how the political wind blows in Ireland.\"</p><p>Hawkes disputes claims that his office is under-resourced, pointing to a recent staff increase and a budget to hire in technical staff for audits. The commissioner's auditing and amicable resolution approach should not, he says, be confused with light-touch regulation. \"People confuse fines with enforcement, but fines don't necessarily lead to compliance,\" he said. \"We have extremely strong enforcement powers, and people know we have them.\"</p><p>But it's not just foreign observers who are concerned. An Irish privacy campaigner sees a disconnect between official Ireland's enthusiasm in attracting companies to our shores - and courting them when they are here - and in regulating them.</p><p>\"There is little official awareness or interest in Ireland in what <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>or Google do, so there is no concern,\" argues TJ McIntyre, a lecturer in information-technology law at University College Dublin and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland. \"But apathy is not a policy.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lax standards?</emphasis>McIntyre argues that Ireland applies the same lax standards to its European privacy obligations as it does to domestic cases, where Irish public servants, from garda^K to Revenue officials, face censure but never prosecution when caught snooping on others' files in official databases.</p><p>While Irish audiences hang on every word of the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executive Sheryl Sandberg when she visits, a debate is raging around Europe about the long-term effects of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and others on the media, democratic values and even how we perceive the world around us.</p><p>The debate began in Germany's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frankfurter Allgemeine </emphasis>daily newspaper, when Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, warned that \"heavy-handed regulation . . . risks creating an innovation desert in Europe\".</p><p>In an frank response, Matthias D^fpfner, chief executive of Germany's Axel Springer AG media group, wrote that \"we are afraid of Google\" and its insatiable appetite for data on what users read, where they go, who they know and what they think. \"Forget Big Brother,\" he added, \"Google is better.\"</p><p>In the latest <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frankfurter Allgemeine</emphasis> contribution to the topic, Shoshana Zuboff, professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, says Google bears characteristics of an absolute power that tolerates no dissent. Behind its rhetoric of openness - demanding full transparency from users as the price for using its \"free\" services - Google demands absolute privacy to collect and evaluate the mountains of user data its services generate.</p><p>Worse, she says, its penetrating curiosity about users' habits, movements, thoughts and secrets have, via the Prism programme, made US tech companies Trojan horses for US intelligence services.</p><p>Ireland's success in attracting tech giants could put it on a collision course with its European neighbours. Some EU governments suggest Europe's best response to the NSA scandal would be to make Europe a global leader in privacy issues. </p><p>Economies based on secure digital storage and data integrity - not free cloud storage with complementary NSA oversight - could, goes the argument, attract a lot of international business and generate robust growth for Europe.
