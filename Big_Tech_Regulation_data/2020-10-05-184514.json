Conventional macroeconomic models failed to predict the calamity or to provide a coherent explanation for it, and thus were unable to offer guidance on how to repair the damage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite this, much of the profession remains in denial, hankering for a return to 'normal' and in effect treating the crisis as just a rude interruption.</p><p>That needs to change. Although an economic recovery has taken root, its structural fragilities suggest that macroeconomics is still in pressing need of an overhaul. Three sets of lessons from the past decade stand out.</p><p>First, the presumption that economies are self-correcting, while tempting in good times, is unfounded and can have catastrophic consequences.</p><p>The recovery of the past few years has lulled many into a false sense of security, because it was the result of unconventional policy responses that transcended mainstream 'general equilibrium' thinking.</p><p>Moreover, pre-crisis economic models are struggling to cope with the disruption unleashed by emerging digital technologies.</p><p>The digital economy is characterised by increasing returns to scale, whereby Big Tech companies rapidly exploit network effects to dominate a growing array of markets.</p><p>This has upended incumbent business models and transformed behavior in ways that have left macroeconomists and policymakers struggling - and mostly failing - to keep pace.</p><p>Consequently, the widespread belief that economic activity will follow a regular cycle around a stable growth trend is not very helpful beyond the very short term.</p><p>Rather, the economic disruptions we are experiencing highlight an obvious fact, but one that prevailing models assume away: the future is fundamentally uncertain, and not all risks are quantifiable.</p><p>Precisely for that reason, we should reject the notion that emerged in the aftermath of the crisis that the world would enter a 'new normal.'</p><p>In the face of evolving structural shifts in finance, technology, society, and politics, it is far more useful to think in terms of a 'New Abnormal,' in which economies are characterised by actual or latent structural instability.</p><p>The second lesson from the crisis is that balance sheets matter. The financialisation of the global economy leaves national economies vulnerable to major corrections in asset prices that can render debt unserviceable.</p><p>Macroeconomic models that focus on flows of income and spending ignore the critical role played by such wealth effects.</p><p>Compounding the problem, these models are unable to predict asset prices, because the latter reflect investors' beliefs about future returns and risks. In other words, asset prices are hard to forecast because they are themselves forecasts.</p><p>Moreover, financial regulation since the crisis has not necessarily solved the balance-sheet problem. True, individual banks have become more resilient as a result of having to raise their capital and liquidity buffers substantially.</p><p>But years of unprecedented monetary easing and large-scale asset purchases by central banks have encouraged risk-taking across the economic and financial system in ways that are harder to track and predict.</p><p>In addition, policymakers' determination to limit taxpayers' exposure when financial institutions fail has led to risks being shifted onto investors through the use of instruments such as 'bail-in-able' bonds.</p><p>The systemic effects of such ongoing regulatory changes won't be clear until the next recession strikes.</p><p>There is also a growing recognition that financial balance sheets are not the only type that matter.</p><p>As climate change and environmental degradation move up the political agenda, macroeconomists are beginning to appreciate the importance of other, less volatile forms of capital for sustainable growth and wellbeing.</p><p>In particular, they need to understand better the interaction of produced capital, whether tangible or intangible; human capital, including skills and knowledge; and natural capital, which includes the renewable and non-renewable resources and environment that support life.</p><p>Lastly, macroeconomists must recognise that distribution matters. Trying to model households' economic behaviour on the basis of a single 'representative agent' elides crucial differences in the experiences and behaviour of people in different income and wealth brackets.</p><p>The fact that the rich disproportionately benefited from globalisation and new technologies, not to mention from central banks' successful efforts to boost equity and bond prices after 2009, has arguably been a drag on growth.</p><p>What is certain is that widening inequality has dramatically reduced support for mainstream politicians in favour of populists and nationalists, in turn corroding the previous policy consensus that sustained fiscal probity, independent monetary policy, free trade, and the liberal movement of capital and labour.</p><p>The global backlash against the economic and political status quo has also targeted big business. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, financial institutions were in the firing line.</p><p>But popular anger has since morphed into a general skepticism about corporate behaviour, with the tech giants coming under particular scrutiny for alleged abuses of user data and monopoly power.</p><p>It would be too simplistic to view these tensions as the result of resentment toward the top 1 per cent.</p><p>There are substantial divisions within the remaining 99 per cent between winners and losers from globalisation.</p><p>Moreover, divisions between countries have intensified as populists and nationalists blame foreigners for domestic economic and social problems.</p><p>This has contributed to wider questioning of globalisation and international trade, investment, and tax rules.</p><p>Changes in global governance arrangements may disrupt business models, transform the institutional framework, and add a fresh layer of uncertainty to the economic outlook.</p><p>The macroeconomics profession has yet to come to terms with the most important lessons of the past decade.</p><p>And without a new consensus on how to manage uncertainty, the world is uncomfortably vulnerable to fresh economic, social, and political shocks. Sadly, another crisis may be needed to force economists to abandon their outmoded ways.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYMTR-DMONITOR25092019000514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYMTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4M-MGG1-JCH9-G2P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416412</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nation Media Group (NMG) Limited.

That's an increasingly urgent question given the activities of Victoria-based AggregateIQ , Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, not to mention Russia, in recent elections in Europe and the United States. Canada needs to prepare itself for the 2019 federal election, and the Canadian government is starting to talk more seriously about how to address the risks we face. The issues of disinformation, hate speech and targeted manipulation of voters are complicated, and the policy solutions are not yet clear. </p><p>What is clear is that Canada needs new inspiration. Canada often looks to the U.S. government as either a leader or partner. This time, Canada should look to Europe. Canada's electoral rules, norms and procedures bear more similarity to many European countries than to the United States. Like them, we keep our election campaigns short. We have strict rules about campaign financing. We also face the same problem: Our citizens use social media platforms created in the U.S. by CEOs who are often unresponsive to non-American concerns about data privacy or electoral interference. There are at least three areas where Canada can take inspiration from Europe. Data privacy First, data privacy. Online giants like Google and Facebook have accumulated huge amounts of data about our lives that are used to design and target political messages. Calling this 'data' is too neutral \u2014 it is, instead, the digital records of the lives we live. It can include the routes we took when walking through our cities, the websites we visited to research our hobbies and fears, and the emotions we revealed in our vocabulary choices. Unlike the U.S., Europe is taking action to give citizens some control over the records of their lives. In May, a new framework for data security will come into force in the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires all organizations that collect and process data to have people's clear and explicit consent. It also gives people the right to know what data about them is being collected, the right to get a copy of that data to take elsewhere and the right to demand that personal data is erased. Facebook, Google and other platforms are retooling their activities to meet the GDPR's provisions, at least for European citizens. Canada can follow in the wake of GDPR and implement similar provisions. Indeed, the Canadian privacy commissioner has been calling for updates to our ' archaic privacy laws ' to ensure meaningful, informed consent for the collection and use of our data, and to give us a right to demand the removal of inaccurate or outdated information. Online harassment Second, preventing online harassment. Our democracy is corroded by online threats, hate and harassment of public figures and ordinary citizens. Twitter and other social media platforms can be toxic , particularly for women, Indigenous Canadians and minorities. This toxic environment can exclude groups that already face marginalization in public debates, and can poison conversations among citizens with different views. The U.S. commitment to freedom of speech, including the absence of hate speech laws, makes it very unlikely it will pursue policies to address these issues. The EU, and especially Germany, are taking a different tack. In 2017, Germany enacted a law to force online platforms to remove 'obviously illegal' posts that contravened German hate speech law within 24 hours or risk fines of up to 50 million euros. While there are valid concerns that the law overreaches and may induce private companies to over-zealously censor content, it has forced social media platforms to take a serious look at how to quickly address problematic content. The new German government has proposed some fixes to address these issues. Canada need not take the German approach. But we can follow Germany's lead of making clear and strong demands about how our own laws on hate speech, defamation and harassment are enforced online. Civic media Third, empowering democratic discourse through civic media. It's not enough to crack down on manipulative or threatening content online. To act as democratic citizens, we need access to diverse, accurate and public-oriented information and conversations. Most European countries spend more on public broadcasters than Canada, and provide direct and indirect support to other journalism organizations to maintain robust media ecosystems. Only a few weeks ago, 71.6 per cent of Swiss citizens voted in a referendum to keep funding their public broadcaster. European countries also convinced Google to commit tens of millions of dollars a year to support news media. A new High Level Expert Group set up by the European Commission to advise them on 'fake news' argued that it is critical to 'safeguard the diversity and sustainability of the European news media ecosystem' through public funding of journalism and supporting civil society groups like fact-checkers, computer scientists and technology innovation centres. The Canadian government recognizes that public-oriented journalism needs support and committed $50 million over five years to support local journalism, though it's not clear this will have a significant or sustainable impact . Read more: How Ottawa should spend its $50 million to support local news Furthermore, it's not just journalism that needs support. We also need more and better civic apps, fact-checking organizations and digital literacy programs. Europe does not have all the answers for Canada. Some European policies may not work or may not fit the Canadian context. But Europeans are taking digital manipulation of democracy seriously. Canada is a small market that cannot hope to sway big tech companies on its own. Working with Europe, which has an economy larger than the U.S. economy , could be the only way for Canada to create change. Canada should look to Europe for ideas and for a negotiating partner.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook Elections Data breaches Cambridge Analytica</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>MENAFN0604201801990000ID1096700960</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1096700960</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W53-1DD1-F04Y-T3ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 5, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

S. Tworek, Assistant Professor of International History, University of British Columbia</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What can we do to shield our democracy from digital manipulation? That's an increasingly urgent question given the activities of Victoria-based AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, not to mention Russia, in recent elections in Europe and the United States.</p><p>Canada needs to prepare itself for the 2019 federal election, and the Canadian government is starting to talk more seriously about how to address the risks we face.</p><p>The issues of disinformation, hate speech and targeted manipulation of voters are complicated, and the policy solutions are not yet clear. What is clear is that Canada needs new inspiration.</p><p>Canada often looks to the U.S. government as either a leader or partner. This time, Canada should look to Europe.</p><p>Canada's electoral rules, norms and procedures bear more similarity to many European countries than to the United States. Like them, we keep our election campaigns short. We have strict rules about campaign financing. We also face the same problem: Our citizens use social media platforms created in the U.S. by CEOs who are often unresponsive to non-American concerns about data privacy or electoral interference.</p><p>There are at least three areas where Canada can take inspiration from Europe.</p><p>Data privacy</p><p>First, data privacy. Online giants like Google and Facebook have accumulated huge amounts of data about our lives that are used to design and target political messages. Calling this \"data\" is too neutral - it is, instead, the digital records of the lives we live. It can include the routes we took when walking through our cities, the websites we visited to research our hobbies and fears, and the emotions we revealed in our vocabulary choices.</p><p>Unlike the U.S., Europe is taking action to give citizens some control over the records of their lives. In May, a new framework for data security will come into force in the European Union.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires all organizations that collect and process data to have people's clear and explicit consent. It also gives people the right to know what data about them is being collected, the right to get a copy of that data to take elsewhere and the right to demand that personal data is erased.</p><p>Facebook, Google and other platforms are retooling their activities to meet the GDPR's provisions, at least for European citizens.</p><p>Canada can follow in the wake of GDPR and implement similar provisions. Indeed, the Canadian privacy commissioner has been calling for updates to our \"archaic privacy laws\" to ensure meaningful, informed consent for the collection and use of our data, and to give us a right to demand the removal of inaccurate or outdated information.</p><p>Online harassment</p><p>Second, preventing online harassment. Our democracy is corroded by online threats, hate and harassment of public figures and ordinary citizens. Twitter and other social media platforms can be toxic, particularly for women, Indigenous Canadians and minorities.</p><p>This toxic environment can exclude groups that already face marginalization in public debates, and can poison conversations among citizens with different views.</p><p>The U.S. commitment to freedom of speech, including the absence of hate speech laws, makes it very unlikely it will pursue policies to address these issues.</p><p>The EU, and especially Germany, are taking a different tack. In 2017, Germany enacted a law to force online platforms to remove \"obviously illegal\" posts that contravened German hate speech law within 24 hours or risk fines of up to 50 million euros.</p><p>While there are valid concerns that the law overreaches and may induce private companies to over-zealously censor content, it has forced social media platforms to take a serious look at how to quickly address problematic content. The new German government has proposed some fixes to address these issues.</p><p>Canada need not take the German approach. But we can follow Germany's lead of making clear and strong demands about how our own laws on hate speech, defamation and harassment are enforced online.</p><p>Civic media</p><p>Third, empowering democratic discourse through civic media. It's not enough to crack down on manipulative or threatening content online. To act as democratic citizens, we need access to diverse, accurate and public-oriented information and conversations.</p><p>Most European countries spend more on public broadcasters than Canada, and provide direct and indirect support to other journalism organizations to maintain robust media ecosystems. Only a few weeks ago, 71.6 per cent of Swiss citizens voted in a referendum to keep funding their public broadcaster.</p><p>European countries also convinced Google to commit tens of millions of dollars a year to support news media. A new High Level Expert Group set up by the European Commission to advise them on \"fake news\" argued that it is critical to \"safeguard the diversity and sustainability of the European news media ecosystem\" through public funding of journalism and supporting civil society groups like fact-checkers, computer scientists and technology innovation centres.</p><p>The Canadian government recognizes that public-oriented journalism needs support and committed $50 million over five years to support local journalism, though it's not clear this will have a significant or sustainable impact.</p><p>Furthermore, it's not just journalism that needs support. We also need more and better civic apps, fact-checking organizations and digital literacy programs.</p><p>Europe does not have all the answers for Canada. Some European policies may not work or may not fit the Canadian context.</p><p>But Europeans are taking digital manipulation of democracy seriously. Canada is a small market that cannot hope to sway big tech companies on its own. Working with Europe, which has an economy larger than the U.S. economy, could be the only way for Canada to create change. Canada should look to Europe for ideas and for a negotiating partner.</p><p>___</p><p>This article was originally published on The Conversation.

South of the border, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 also hit record levels in early trading on the latest developments in attempts to contain the virus.</p><p>At 9:39 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&amp;P/TSX composite index was up 72.71 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 17,849.82.</p><p>Energy stocks were up 2.1 per cent. The materials sector, which includes gold miners, fell 0.6 per cent as bullion prices pulled back.</p><p>In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.41 points, or 0.45%, at the open to 29,406.75.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 opened higher by 12.75 points, or 0.38%, at 3,370.50. The Nasdaq Composite gained 49.66 points, or 0.52%, to 9,688.60 at the opening bell.</p><p>Health officials said the total infections in China have hit 44,653, including 2,015 new confirmed cases on Tuesday. That was the lowest daily rise in new cases since Jan. 30. However, the World Health Organization continued to stress the dangers of the virus with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying the world must \"consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one.\"</p><p>The slowdown in the number of new cases helped buoy world stocks with MSCI's all-country index rising 0.12 per cent to sit just below the record high seen during the previous session. Markets in Europe started higher with trade-sensitive auto stocks among the winners. Safe-haven holdings like gold and the Japanese yen were weaker.</p><p>\"The health crisis is worsening, but according to China's National Health Commission, the number of new confirmed cases in one day has fallen to its lowest level since the emergency began last month,\" David Madden, markets analyst with CMC Markets U.K., said.</p><p>\"Traders are taking the view that Beijing are starting to get a handle on the situation, hence why stocks are gaining ground. Some health experts fear we are not over the worse of it, but dealers are clearly bullish on stocks.\"</p><p>On Bay Street, earnings season continues to roll along with a raft of Canadian companies reporting. Cenovus, Cineplex, Shopify and Barrick Gold all deliver results before the start of trading. Manulife and Sun Life post earnings after the close.</p><p>Shopify shares jumped more than 18 per cent in Toronto after the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-shopify-beats-revenue-estimates-boosted-by-black-friday-and-cyber/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-shopify-beats-revenue-estimates-boosted-by-black-friday-and-cyber/</url> in the latest quarter. Shopify's total revenue rose 47 per cent to US$505.2-million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$343.9-million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of about US$482-million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company posted net income of US$771,000, or 1 cent a share, from a loss of US$1.5-million, or 1 US cent per share, a year ago.</p><p>Outside earnings, Canadian National Railway Co. said it \"will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-cn-rail-to-shut-significant-sections-of-track-if-coastal-gaslink/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-cn-rail-to-shut-significant-sections-of-track-if-coastal-gaslink/</url>\" of its network if protests don't end soon along Southern Ontario rail lines, which control trains headed east and west. After nearly a week of protest, hundreds of trains hauling everything from fresh produce to chlorine for municipal water purification were stopped. Protests escalated and spread across the country after police confronted protesters from the Wet'suwet'en Nation who had blocked construction of the Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline in British Columbia. CN shares were down slightly at the open.</p><p>On Wall Street, shares of Lyft were down more than 6 per cent in early trading after the ride-sharing company reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-lyft-tops-1-billion-quarterly-revenue-forecasts-slower-growth-in/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-lyft-tops-1-billion-quarterly-revenue-forecasts-slower-growth-in/</url> of more than US$1-billion but also forecast slower revenue growth in the new year and left its target date for profitability unchanged.</p><p>After Wall Street's closing bell, Cisco Systems, Applied Material and TripAdvisor all report results.</p><p>Overseas, major European markets were higher with the pan-European STOXX 600 rising 0.47 per cent in afternoon trading on broad gains. Auto shares, which are sensitive to trade issues with China, were among the best performers as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus ease.</p><p>Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.44 per cent. Germany's DAX rose 0.75 per cent. France's CAC 40 rose 0.51 per cent.</p><p>In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index ended up 0.87 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng also finished up 0.87 per cent. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.74 per cent.</p><p>Commodities</p><p>Crude prices continued to rebound as hopes grow that the spread of the coronavirus is slowing.</p><p>The day range on Brent is US$54.39 to US$55.40. The range on West Texas Intermediate is US$49.95 to US$50.89. Both benchmarks hit their lowest levels in more than a year on Monday on concerns that the spread of the virus would dampen global demand. Both are down roughly 20 per cent from highs seen in January.</p><p>Last week, concerns over weaker demand as a result of the virus pushed the crude market into contango, where near-term contracts fall below later-term contracts, suggesting oversupply concerns.</p><p>However, the latest reports suggesting a slowing in the number of new cases of the virus in China have helped offset some of those concerns.</p><p>\"Copper as well as oil rallied yesterday on account of the decline in the fear surrounding China,\" CMC Markets' David Madden said. \"The commodities suffered greatly in the last few weeks because dealers were afraid China's economy would be hampered by coronavirus, but traders were tempted by the relatively low prices, especially in light of the change in sentiment in relation to China. \"</p><p>Meanwhile, markets are also awaiting further word on possible deeper production cuts by OPEC and its allies. A technical committee has recommended curbing supply by another 600,000 barrels a day, although Russia has yet to back that proposal.</p><p>AxiTrader strategist Stephen Innes said markets appear to be reading a lot into a meeting Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his 'energy czar' Igor Sechin, although nothing has been formally announced.</p><p>\"Still, the market is paring back shorts in case the outcome of this meeting triggers an actionable OPEC+ emergency meeting,\" he said.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute also reported that U.S. crude inventories rose by 6 million barrels last week. Analysts had been expecting an increase of about 3 million barrels. Official figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday morning.</p><p>In other commodities, gold prices slid as risk appetite increased.</p><p>Spot gold edged 0.2 per cent lower to US$1,564.15 per ounce. U.S. gold futures were down 0.2 per cent at US$1,567.50.</p><p>\"Equity market is doing good, U.S. dollar is above 98.5 and there is some rebound in base metals and energy markets that is showing some increasing risk appetite in investors,\" Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of commodity research at SMC Comtrade, told Reuters.</p><p>Currencies</p><p>The Canadian dollar edged higher, helped by rebounding crude prices and improving risk sentiment on global markets.</p><p>The day range on the loonie is 75.21 US cents to 75.38 US cents.</p><p>There were no major Canadian economic releases due although Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is set to participate in a panel discussion in Australia later this evening.</p><p>\"If Governor Poloz feels he has something to say before his second last rate decision on March 4, then [Wednesday] may be the time to do it,\" Derek Holt, vice-president and head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said in a recent note. (Mr. Poloz is set to depart his post when his term ends later this year)</p><p>Mr. Holt said Mr. Poloz last spoke at the bank's Jan. 22 press conference when he said that a rate cut remains on the table.</p><p>\"Since Poloz's last appearance, developments have been mixed - a favourite word of the BoC's,\" he said. \"Coronavirus cases have grown exponentially, but mostly within China and with only a handful of cases in Canada.\"</p><p>\"Further, much but not all of the correction in WTI and Western Canada Select oil prices was in place by the time of the last rate decision while broad commodity prices edged a little lower in keeping with coronavirus-related concerns toward China's economy. \"</p><p>Canadian economic reports, meanwhile, have been slightly better than expected with retail sales and GDP both advancing while job growth and wages firmed, Mr. Holt noted.</p><p>On global markets, the U.S. dollar sat near its best level in four months. Against a basket of major currencies, the U.S. dollar index edged up 0.1 per cent to 98.77, just below a four-month high of 98.95 hit during Tuesday's session.</p><p>The New Zealand dollar jumped 0.8 per cent to 64.62 US cents, its biggest rise in two months, after the central bank removed the chance of a rate cut from its forward projections, according to Reuters. Recession concerns in Europe push the euro to a four-month low overnight. It has since recovered to trade flat at US$1.0915.</p><p>More company news</p><p>Barrick Gold Corp reported a higher quarterly adjusted profit and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-higher-prices-and-output-fuel-barrick-profit-jump/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-higher-prices-and-output-fuel-barrick-profit-jump/</url> by 40 per cent, benefiting from higher output and prices. Barrick's adjusted profit rose to $300-million, or 17 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $69-million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Barrick said gold production rose 14 per cent to 1.44 million ounces from a year earlier, confirming the preliminary numbers released last month.</p><p>Cenovus Energy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-cenovus-posts-profit-fuelled-by-higher-gas-prices/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-cenovus-posts-profit-fuelled-by-higher-gas-prices/</url> compared with a year-ago loss, benefiting from higher Canadian crude prices and increased U.S. sales as it moved more oil by rail. Net earnings from continuing operations were $113-million, or 9 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $1.35-billion, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. Total production from continuing operations rose 8-per-cent to 467,448 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Excluding items, Cenovus posted a loss of 13 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected the company to report a profit of 11 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p><p>Cineplex Inc. reported its fourth-quarter profit fell compared with a year ago <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-costs-of-cineworld-deal-drag-on-cineplexs-fourth-quarter-profit/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-costs-of-cineworld-deal-drag-on-cineplexs-fourth-quarter-profit/</url> related to the takeover of the movie theatre company by U.K.-based Cineworld PLC. Cineplex says it earned $3.5-million or 6 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended Dec. 31 compared with a profit of $27.2-million or 43 cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue totalled $443.2-million, up from $427.8-million.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc sank 25 per cent in morning trading after the retailer said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-bed-bath-beyond-shares-plunge-26-per-cent-on-weak-same-store-sales/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-bed-bath-beyond-shares-plunge-26-per-cent-on-weak-same-store-sales/</url> were hit by increased promotions, falling store traffic and inventory management issues. The company said same-store sales for December and January fell 5.4 per cent. Analysts on average were expecting a drop of 3.97% for the fourth quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p><p>Japan's SoftBank Group Corp said on Wednesday its third-quarter operating profit fell 99 per cent, well short of analyst estimates, pulled down by a second consecutive quarter of losses at the US$100-billion Vision Fund. The Vision Fund posted an operating loss of 225 billion yen (US$2.05-billion) for October-December compared to 176 billion yen profit in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Concerned that big tech companies are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-us-trade-body-requests-data-from-tech-giants-on-small-mergers-in/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-us-trade-body-requests-data-from-tech-giants-on-small-mergers-in/</url> the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday it ordered Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp to provide information on mergers that were too small to report to antitrust regulators.</p><p>Nissan Motor Co on Wednesday said it had filed a civil lawsuit in Japan against former Chairman Carlos Ghosn seeking 10 billion yen (US$91.02-million) in damages over his alleged financial misconduct. Mr. Ghosn had been facing criminal charges in Japan for understating his annual salary and misusing company funds, until he fled to Lebanon in December.

Let's be honest: Life without Google would be awfully more tedious in a variety of important ways.But that is not a good reason to leave Google and the other tech giants alone. On the contrary, the nature and importance of their contribution make it imperative that they be placed under democratic control and not just because of the well-appreciated need to protect individual privacy.In recent years, Big Tech companies have been subjected to scrutiny for perfecting a dark art pioneered by commercial newspapers, radio and television: attracting and holding our attention, in order to sell access to our senses to paying advertisers. Whereas readers, listeners and viewers were customers paying for some commodity, commercial electronic media learned how to profit by transacting directly with vendors while reducing us, and our data, to a passive commodity at the heart of the transaction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Facebook and others were able to take this odd production process, where our attention is the traded commodity, to a different level, thanks to their stupendous capacity to personalize our screens.</p><p>Unlike their forebears, they can capture the attention of each one of us with person-specific (or even mood-specific) attractors, before selling to the highest bidder access both to our data and to our senses.</p><p>Underlying the backlash against Big Tech has been the sense that we are all becoming proletarianized users. In the 1970s and 1980s, we were annoyed when commercial channels ambushed us with advertisements seconds before the end of a cliff-hanger movie or basketball match. Now, we can no longer even recognize the tricks used in real time to hold and sell our attention.</p><p>Alienated from a market trading in us, we have become cogs in a production process that excludes us as anything but its product.</p><p>Data protection and privacy regulations are meant to return to us some of our lost autonomy regarding what we see, what guides our choices and who knows what we choose. But regulating Big Tech to protect our data and restore \"consumer sovereignty\" is not enough. Against a background of automation and labor casualization, these firms' monopoly profits boost inequality, fuel discontent, undermine aggregate demand for goods and services, and further destabilize capitalism.</p><p>The problem is that traditional government interventions are an exercise in futility: Taxing free services is pointless. Taxing robots, to fund humans, is as impossible as it is to define them. And while taxing Big Tech's profits is essential, these firms' skilled accountants and abundant opportunities to shift profits to different jurisdictions makes this difficult.</p><p>A simple solution exists, if we look beyond taxation. But it requires accepting that capital is no longer privately produced, as least not in the case of Google et al.</p><p>When James Watt built one of his famed steam engines, it was his creation, his product. A buyer who put the engine to work in, say, a textile factory could think of his profit stream as a just reward for having taken the risk of purchasing the machine and for the innovation of coupling it to a spinning jenny or a mechanical loom.</p><p>By contrast, Google cannot credibly argue that the capital generating its profit stream was produced entirely privately. Every time you use Google's search engine to look up a phrase, concept or product, or visit a place via Google Maps, you enrich Google's capital. While the servers and software design, for example, have been produced capitalistically, a large part of Google's capital is produced by almost everyone. Every user, in principle, has a legitimate claim to being a de facto shareholder.</p><p>Of course, while a substantial part of Big Tech's capital is produced by the public, there is no sensible way to compute personal contributions, which makes it impossible to calculate what our individual shares ought to be. But this impossibility can be turned into a virtue, by creating a public trust fund to which companies like Google transfer a percentage say, 10 percent of their shares. Suddenly, every child has a trust fund, with the accumulating dividends providing a universal basic income (UBI) that grows in proportion to automation and in a manner that limits inequality and stabilizes the macroeconomy.</p><p>This attractive solution must overcome two obstacles. First, we tend to think of taxation as a panacea. But a UBI funded via taxation is sure to trigger a backlash among struggling working people who cannot see the logic of subsidizing the idle, rich or poor. Second, corporate shares are typically given to employees only.</p><p>To be sure, there are excellent reasons for taxing profits in order to fund benefits for the poor, and for worker-ownership schemes. But these are separate issues from the one at hand: how to stabilize society by granting property rights over Google's capital to everyone who helped create it, including unwaged carers, the precariously employed and society's dropouts.</p><p>And then, as one would expect, there is the motivated fallacy peddled by the defenders of the status quo.</p><p>The Financial Times' Alphaville column recently dismissed the case for transferring a block of shares from Big Tech corporations, like Google, to a public trust fund by misrepresenting the underlying argument as a failure to appreciate what Google has done for us. To repudiate society's property rights over the returns to capital that we, as users, have created, Big Tech's defenders invoke users' large consumer surplus (the sum we would be prepared to pay for access to free services such as Gmail and Google Maps).</p><p>This is a little like justifying the confiscation of your shares in a company with the argument that the company is providing valuable services to you and others. In using Big Tech's services, we manufacture a portion of its capital in real time. Property rights over that portion for all of us, rather than for any of us must follow.</p><p>Yanis Varoufakis, a former finance minister of Greece, is professor of economics at the University of Athens.

In a fascinating essay for the New Atlantis, Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere.

They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies.  Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p> What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service.</p><p> Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p> A leading voice for this second group is Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p> Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed -- on Twitter, naturally -- that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p> They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse.\" He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p> Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p> What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p> Those who fear government regulation in this area (and not just conservatives) have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material, even if that material falls under the First Amendment.</p><p> We can split the difference on the question of what the law assumes. The CDA does not require companies to be neutral about the political content of messages they host in order to have immunity. It was, in fact, written to encourage them to police obscenity, which is why it's called the Communications Decency Act.</p><p> So what options does the government have to deal with the perceived problem?</p><p> Perhaps we should split the difference on the policy question, too. The companies are too important to ignore, but government regulation is full of dangers.</p><p> It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p> Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p><p> Ramesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BHERLD-50201544914009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EA9601E9FB0B18A BHERLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W94-R7H1-DXVP-V00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Boston Herald Inc.

The CEO<br/>On Friday afternoon, Facebook made one of its most controversial content moderation decisions in company history. After President Trump posted to Facebook some tweets that Twitter had placed behind a warning for \"glorifying violence,\" Mark Zuckerberg said that the company would allow them to stand.</p><p><br/>\"I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up,\" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post, \"but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies.\"<br/>\"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted - quoting a former Miami police chief who, in 1967, called for a violent crackdown on the city's black community. And just as the president suggested, a long weekend of violence followed in the United States, with police assaulting protesters and bystanders across the country in the days that followed.<br/>Zuckerberg said that Facebook left the post up for two reasons: one, that \"people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force.\" And two, that Trump had sort of (maybe?) walked back his original post in a later one, \"saying that the original post was warning about the possibility that looting could lead to violence.\" So whether or not Trump meant to incite violence with his words, Zuckerberg argued, Facebook had good reason to let the post stand.<br/>Shortly after sharing the post with the world, Zuckerberg held a meeting with employees to elaborate on his point of view. In audio of the meeting that I obtained, Zuckerberg said that he had agonized over the decision. \"How to handle this post from the president has been very tough,\" said Zuckerberg, who was joined in the discussion by his head of policy management, Monika Bickert. \"It's been something that I've been struggling with basically all day, ever since I woke up. ... This has been personally pretty wrenching for me.\"<br/>Zuckerberg reiterated his unhappiness with Trump's remarks. \"My first reaction ... was just disgust,\" he said. \"This is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time. This is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling.\"<br/>Ultimately, he and Bickert said, executives concluded that Trump's remarks didn't violate their existing policies. But he said they would re-examine their policies around politicians discussing the use of state force on Facebook, a process he said would likely take several weeks.<br/>\"There is a real question coming out of this, which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force,\" he told employees Friday. \"Over the coming days, as the National Guard is now deployed, probably the largest one that I would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force. I think there's a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that.\" Zuckerberg did not elaborate on what more \"bounds\" would mean in this case, or whether he thought the policy should change to disallow posts like Trump's.<br/>In response to an employee question, Zuckerberg also said he disagreed with Twitter's approach of placing violating tweets behind a warning. \"If you really believe that a post is going to cause people to go to go do real-world violence, then that's not the type of thing that I think we should have up even behind a warning,\" he said. \"Some people might be comforted that Twitter took a step, even if it didn't go all the way. But I don't personally agree with that step.\"<br/>Zuckerberg's message to employees Friday was that even if Facebook hadn't removed this Trump post, it was prepared to do so in the future if the president violated a company policy. That satisfied some employees, but to others it smacked of appeasement. On Thursday, their anger bubbled up in a series of internal threads, as I reported at The Verge.<br/>And then, over the weekend, the long-standing norm that Facebook employees never criticize their employer in public seemed to shatter, tweet by tweet.<br/>On Monday, they mounted the most significant collective worker action in the company's 15-year history. While it's difficult to measure the number of people who participated in a virtual walkout, an internal group devoted to the effort had about 400 people, sources said.<br/>II. The walkout<br/>\"I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence,\" tweeted Jason Stirman, who works on research and development, on Saturday. \"I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism.\"<br/>Jason Toff, a former employee of Twitter and Google who now works on experimental apps at Facebook, echoed those sentiments on Sunday. \"I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up,\" Toff tweeted. \"The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard.\"<br/>Within hours, there were more than a dozen such tweets from employees working across the company, all expressing disappointment with their employer's decision. And on Monday, dozens of employees staged a virtual walkout, making themselves unavailable for the day and joining in protests. The New York Times reported that employees are working on a list of demands, and that some senior employees have threatened to resign if Zuckerberg doesn't reverse his decision.<br/>\"As allies we must stand in the way of danger, not behind,\" tweeted Sara Zhang, a product designer at Facebook. \"I will be participating in today's virtual walkout in solidarity with the black community inside and outside FB. #BlackLivesMatter\"<br/>By this point we have seen our share of worker actions at big tech companies. The Google walkout over sexual harassment kicked open the doors in 2018, and has been followed by high-profile protests at Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce, among others. And hundreds of Facebook employees signed an open letter to Zuckerberg in October about his decision to exempt political ads from fact-checking.<br/>But notable as that letter was, it still adopted the form that dissent has almost always taken at Facebook: vigorous internal debate. (One source told me the internal furor over Joel Kaplan's public support of controversial Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh during his nomination hearings had been markedly more intense.) What's different about Monday's walkout is that the protests were public first - and posted about on a rival social network, to boot. For Facebook workers, the choice to discuss their concerns on Twitter was remarkably effective, for two reasons. One, Twitter is where journalists live, and so the posts were guaranteed to generate coverage. Two, sentiment about Facebook on Twitter is generally hostile, so current employees' criticisms of the company got massive distribution through retweets.<br/>The workers' comments were less sweeping in their criticism than some former employees, co-founders, and top executives of Facebook have been over the years. None of these employees has yet quit, nor have they suggested, as WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton once did, that people \"delete Facebook.\" But what they shared was a sense of shame in their employer that remains extraordinary among tech workers, even at a time when worker actions are becoming more common.<br/>\"Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here,\" tweeted Lauren Tan, an engineer. \"I absolutely disagree with it. I enjoy the technical parts of my job and working alongside smart/kind people, but this isn't right. Silence is complicity.\"<br/>Another inspired aspect of the workers' protest was that executives had to sit back and accept it, at least in their public statements. You can't bend over backwards to allow the president's posts about shooting up crowds and then tell employees they can't discuss their feelings about it. And so the official word from Facebook on all the controversy was that they should go for it. \"We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community,\" the company told Bloomberg. \"We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\"<br/>Much of employees' frustration appears to be rooted in the fear that there is no line Trump could cross that would lead Facebook to enforce its policies. Zuckerberg and Bickert spent much of the all-hands meeting on Friday pushing back on that idea - fairly, I think. It was barely two months ago that the company removed a post by the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, for promoting a phony coronavirus cure. You can argue that the company is more sensitive to pressure from conservatives in the United States, and a lot of good reporting has borne that out in the past few years. But the idea that there's no line Trump can't cross on Facebook doesn't strike me as plausible.<br/>Of course, we won't know for sure until Facebook actually does take action against Trump. And in the meantime, a large number of employees have signaled that for them, that red line has already been crossed. For Zuckerberg and his policy team, Trump is a legalistic problem - a question of how certain words and phrases do or do not comport with the standards they have written. But for the workers speaking out, Trump is a moral problem - a danger to their friends, their families, their communities, and themselves.<br/>Facebook's scale depends on courting Republicans and Democrats equally - making regular concessions to both to ensure that the platform is as large as it can be. Zuckerberg has sought to draw a distinction between his role as CEO and his own feelings - arguing for Trump's right to free expression at work while donating $10 million to groups working on racial justice in his personal time.<br/>But since its founding, Facebook has been dedicated to the idea that in this life, you only get to have one real identity. When employees logged off Monday, the company began to see the limits of having it both ways.<br/>What's nextSenior black executives were meeting with Zuckerberg on Monday to discuss their concerns. Facebook is having an all-hands meeting with employees Tuesday where Zuckerberg is expected to take questions. Walkout organizers are developing a list of demands for the company.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending up: YouTube is donating $1 million to the Center for Policing Equity, to demonstrate \"solidarity against racism and violence.\" The company tweeted that it was pledging the funds \"in support of efforts to address social injustice.\" (Kim Lyons / The Verge)<br/>Trending down: A a technical glitch on TikTok made it look like posts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd were receiving zero views.

One of the rumors claimed authorities had somehow blocked protesters from communicating from their smartphones in order to crack down on the unrest. Here are Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Fenit Nirappil from The Washington Post:<br/>Protests in downtown Washington and near the White House were widespread Sunday night and into Monday morning. What started as largely peaceful protests over last week's police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis deteriorated after dark in Washington, with rioters smashing windows, starting fires and overturning vehicles - despite an 11 p.m. curfew.<br/>But the degree of mayhem described by tweets using #DCblackout went far beyond reality. Alarming text was interspersed with shaky videos of confrontations between police and protesters, though it wasn't clear how many of the images were from Washington, as opposed to other U.S. cities facing unrest.<br/>Social media is being used to galvanize protestors. But misinformation about the unrest is also going viral on the platforms - and not just in DC. (Sarah E. Needleman and Sebastian Herrera / The Wall Street Journal)<br/>Authorities and law enforcement officials are helping to push a narrative that outside groups were responsible for inciting violent confrontations at the protests over the weekend. But there's little evidence for those claims. (Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins / NBC)<br/>Over the weekend, people across the US have captured what may be the most comprehensive live picture of police brutality ever. This post includes images and videos of those scenes captured across the country, which were shared widely across social sites. (T.C. Sottek / The Verge)<br/>Police violence will make it harder to fight COVID-19. In the aftermath of the police response to protests, vulnerable communities may be even less likely to trust and cooperate with health officials. That could make it harder to control another wave of illness. (Nicole Wetsman / The Verge)<br/>The Dallas Police Department asked people to send in \"video of illegal activity\" from the Black Lives Matter protests in the city. Instead, it received a flood of pictures and videos of K-pop artists. (Caroline Haskins / BuzzFeed)<br/>Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the killing of George Floyd in a letter to employees, saying the \"painful past is still present today.\" He also said the company would be donating to the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit focusing on racial injustice. (Mark Gurman / Bloomberg)<br/>Google CEO Sundar Pichai emailed employees on Friday about the growing protests and unrest in the US. The tech exec did not commit to supporting any specific government policy changes in response to the protests, unlike some other technology industry leaders. (Rob Price / Business Insider)<br/>Snap CEO Evan Spiegel called for the creation of an American commission to address racial injustice and comprehensive tax reform. In a lengthy note to employees, he said he was \"heartbroken and enraged\" by racism in America. Give this one a read - it's by far the most thoughtful of the corporate responses to this weekend's violence that I've seen.<br/>Trump's executive order on social media companies could backfire. Without certain liability protections, companies like Twitter would have to be more aggressive about policing messages that press the boundaries - including the president's. (Peter Baker and Daisuke Wakabayashi / The New York Times)<br/>Also: Trump's order could hurt online speech by pressuring social media platforms to give his content preferential treatment. (Charles Duan and Jeffrey Westling / Lawfare)<br/>President Trump's decision to go after Twitter for fact-checking his tweets is part of a long tradition upheld by aggrieved internet trolls. A power user with a passionate following is lashing out against the moderators of his favorite internet services. The best description of the dynamic between Trump, Twitter and Facebook that I've read to date. (Kevin Roose / The New York Times)<br/>Senate lawmakers are unveiling a bipartisan bill to regulate contact-tracing and exposure-notification apps. Their goal is to ensure that apps meant to combat the coronavirus don't come at the expense of users' privacy. (Tony Romm / The Washington Post)<br/>State-based contact tracing apps could be a disaster. With no national plan for these apps, security and interoperability issues loom large. (Andy Greenberg / Wired)<br/>YouTube said it made a mistake in deleting videos about the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine posted by a popular doctor. The content appears to have been collateral damage in the company's fight against COVID-19 misinformation. (Mark Bergen / Bloomberg)<br/>Industry\u2b50Google rescinded offers to several thousand contractors due to an advertising slump created by the coronavirus crisis. The move affected more than 2,000 people globally who had signed offers to be a contract or temp worker. Daisuke Wakabayashi at The New York Times has the story:<br/>Many of the contract and temp candidates who had agreed to work at Google before the pandemic took hold in the United States were let go without any severance or financial compensation. This came after weeks of uncertainty as Google repeatedly postponed their start dates during which time they were not paid by Google or the staffing agencies.<br/>Some of the would-be contractors left stable, full-time jobs once they received an employment offer at Google and are now searching for work in a difficult labor market. Some, who are Americans, said the rescinded offers have complicated and, in some cases, delayed their ability to receive unemployment benefits because they left their last jobs voluntarily, according to several of the workers facing this quandary.<br/>Coronavirus mutual aid groups are organizing on Slack. They're distributing groceries and spare air conditioners using tools designed to turn labor into money as efficiently as possible.

Readers should note that, in the past, Facebook has used portability tools such as Download Your Information, and has been part of industry coalitions such as Data Transfer Project along with Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Apple.<br/><br/>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforced data portability in 2018, where it made data portability a right under which the \"the data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Note that data portability is also being considered in India and was a part of the draft Data Protection Bill, but didn't talk about transferring user data from one data fiduciary to another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is data portability important?</p><p>Data portability is important because allows users greater control over their data, and attempts to encourage greater competition among companies that aren't necessarily Big Tech. \"Portability is brought up in the context of unlocking competition. One of the barriers to switching services is that pre-existing data is locked into the service you have been using. It fits into a data protection law because it is an expression of your control over your data. Even if you believe my data is your IP, a lot of this data is both generated by me, pertains to me, and therefore this law permits me to take a copy of it,\" Amba Kak, former Public Policy Advisor at Mozilla had explained at a MediaNamaevent (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2018/09/223-namaprivacy-ownership-of-data-impact-on-businesses-data-portability-erasure/\">https://www.medianama.com/2018/09/223-namaprivacy-ownership-of-data-impact-on-businesses-data-portability-erasure/</url>).</p><p>Key questions raised by Facebook in the paper</p><p>In the paper, Facebook highlights the following concerns related to data portability:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Defining responsibility for data post-transfer:</emphasis>Facebook points out that the question of responsibility when it comes to individuals about whom data is transferred by another party as part of a portability request is particularly vexed. Should there be a consent mechanism in place? Could a better outcome be to limit liability for requesting users to only cases involving truly unreasonable or reckless behavior, such as knowingly transferring their contacts' data to a party known to have a history of data misuse or poor data protection practices?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Defining the role of transferring entities in protecting privacy while enabling data portability:</emphasis>Facebook has called on policymakers and regulators to clarify what is expected of the transferring entities.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If data associated with more than one person should be portable:</emphasis> When data is ported, especially across social media networks, elements such as photos and videos concern more than one person. Is data ownership enough? Should tagged people in a photo have a say in how the photo owner may share the information across service providers? Is porting a user's social graph (user's own data as well as data about the map of connection between a user and other users and entities on that service) a good idea?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If all user-directed data transfers to third parties constitute \"data portability\":</emphasis>Facebook mentioned that stakeholders have tried to distinguish between platform-to-app transfers of data as different from transfers made possible by \"true\" data portability. On the other hand, other commentators have said that Cambridge Analytica happened because of data portability. So the key question is which transfers should be considered as involving \"data portability\" and what obligations on each party in the transaction, if any, should flow from each model?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If all data user data with a company should be portable:</emphasis>Facebook says that not all data a service provider has on a user is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">provided </emphasis>by the user; some of it is generated or inferred by the service provider on the basis of the user's activity. Is the latter also portable data? [The Indian draft Data Protection Bill believes so.]</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If user data should be retained forever:</emphasis>Facebook points out that not all user data is retained forever, and some of it is deleted. In that case, should service providers build tools to export soon-to-be-deleted data as well? Should a period be defined beyond which service providers don't have to store user data for portability purposes? Facebook cites operational burden on smaller providers as a reason to impose limitations on a service provider's obligation make observed data portable.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If different types of data should have different levels of ease of portability:</emphasis> Given complexity of data ownership around certain kinds of data assets, Facebook asks if certain types data should be more portable than others. For instance, should emails addresses be easier to port than photos? What about emails themselves?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Data sharing and data portability are different: MediaNama's take</p><p>In its white paper, Facebook has raised some valid concerns about data portability, such as whether operational burdens to carry it out would deter smaller players from being successful, and how would consent mechanisms around shared data work. But there are a few aspects that are problematic, or have not been addressed in the report:</p><p>1. B2B transfer of information of data portability not covered: Facebook sees data portability only as \"an action that individual users of a service choose to take\", not as something that involves \"business-to-business transfers of information\". This is a limited view of looking at data portability because data portability can primarily be implemented through interactions between two service providers. To exclude B2B transfers of information from the white paper limits its scope severely. Instead, the white paper should have also talked about standards and interoperability.</p><p>2. Facebook Login is data sharing, not data portability: In the white paper, Facebook considers something like Facebook Login as a means of implementing data portability. Facebook Login enables data sharing between the platform and apps. But data sharing and data portability are different concepts. By combining the two, Facebook is trying to evade its responsibility as a platform because in platform-to-app data sharing, the user data and the permissions architecture are still controlled by the platform. Apple's \"Sign-in with Apple\" feature best exemplifies how the platforms bears responsibility for such data.</p><p>3.What about deleting data: Facebook's white paper only talks about soon-to-be deleted data should be exported or not, but offers no clarity on whether data that has been ported out will be deleted or not. It also doesn't talk about how long that data will be retained, post-port.</p><p>An industry source, on the condition of anonymity, said, \"The largest issue for me is who determines the porting standard? The Data Protection Authority? The industry? iSPIRT? I think having multiple port standards is good for consumers, such as RTGS, NEFT, IMPS and UPI for payments. Some are industry architected [sic], others are top-down by regulator. Whoever makes the standard takes the pie.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0049429039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-TW21-DXMP-K3J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As noted by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) \u201cwhile the names have changed \u2013 from Rockefeller and Carnegie to Big Tech \u2013 the story is the same.\u201d As Cicilline said, Big Tech platforms form the arteries of our economic activity and democracy and have abused their power as the railroads of the new economy. Regulation is imminent.   The hearings established common troubling patterns across Big Tech. There is abundant evidence that Big Tech companies are exploiting data and market power to act in ways that are harmful to competition , society and individuals. They monitor and control the competition under the guise of \u201cimproving the product\u201d for which they have \u201cuser consent,\u201d when in fact, their questionable business practices stifle competition , invade privacy , steal intellectual property (IP) and undermine democracy .   While the problem is obvious, the solution is not. There is a lot at stake. How should we think about regulation? Are there useful precedents? And what is unique about current digital platforms that should be considered? Fortunately, we have starting points on both fronts for regulators to consider.    The  financial services industry provides a good initial blueprint  for thinking about the regulation of digital platforms. Such regulation provides a few central tenets that apply to digital platforms. For starters, the operator of a marketplace cannot selectively reward or punish its participants at will or steal their intellectual property (IP). In contrast to financial marketplaces, Google operates both as a buyer and a seller in the ad marketplace, which it controls. Similarly, Amazon competes with its sellers , sometimes driving them out of business. The same is true of Apple, which uses differential pricing to thwart its competitors.    Secondly, financial institutions must \u201cknow\u201d their customers (called KYC), and why they are paying you. Banks, brokers and asset managers must be able to demonstrate that their actions are in the best interests of customers. When asked by Rep. Lucy Kay McBath (D-Ga.) how Amazon knows whether its sellers\u2019 information is correct, Bezos\u2019 answer was \u201cwe don\u2019t.\u201d Neither does Facebook, as long as it gets paid. As far as we know, Amazon could be supporting stolen goods and child labor exploitation without realizing it, as noted by McBath. Would we allow banks to turn a blind eye towards their customers?    These kinds of problems plague the Wild West digital platforms of today. Thus far, the pace of technology has outpaced our ability to control it. That must change.   But it is equally important to consider what is unique about digital platforms, especially the Big Tech platforms of today.   The first is the inherent tendency of digital platforms towards \u201cwinner take all\u201d outcomes, which leads to monopolies. It is therefore difficult to \u201ccreate competition.\u201d But the railroad analogy is appealing: Why not treat digital platforms like railroads and let innovation and growth occur along their rails? After all, the internet is a utility, freely available to everyone. Why not other basic services in a digital economy?    Equally importantly, there is a unique twist that artificial intelligence Big Tech platforms create, namely, their ability for \u201c cross industry disruption \u201d due to the economies of scope they create. In an increasingly virtual world where only a few observe almost all of human activity as data in the physical and digital worlds, the knowledge acquired and its scope of application is staggering, and the incentive systems are rife for misuse. In addition, as noted by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), their size enables them to eliminate entire industries by subsidizing massive losses via profits in their monopolies. To put their size in perspective, Facebook\u2019s market cap is roughly  $15 million per employee compared to $200,000 per employee for Best Buy  and similar physical economy companies. Industrial era companies ran into limits to growth naturally, whereas digital platforms have exactly the opposite property \u2014 their machines allow them to scale up their supply on demand, virtually for free.   In effect, the Big Tech platforms have tremendous market power to enter entirely new industries like transportation and finance, while potentially eliminating banks, auto manufacturers and even transportation service providers. They have no traditional industry boundaries. What industry is Amazon in? How about Google? Or Apple? The very notion of industry has become obsolete. Regulation must recognize this shift in market structure when considering the meaning of competition in the digital economy.   Finally, given the inherent monopolistic nature of digital platforms, it makes sense to consider what parts of such platforms might be considered \u201c digital utilities \u201d that are regulated accordingly to promote equal access to these commodity services and encourage innovation. India, for example, has already adopted this position towards payments and authentication, which it considers digital utilities available to all at low prices, and the creation of \u201cdata fiduciaries\u201d that enable control of data by their creators.   Utility providers operate by a strict set of standards and transparent procedures. If we all rely on a single search algorithm, for example, should we care if the operator of that algorithm changes its ranking criterion at will? How would we feel if someone rearranged the merchants on our streets every day according to what would maximize the revenues of our city, or favor some at the expense of others depending on the preferences of their operators? What risks do such capabilities impose on business and society? These questions will receive more scrutiny going forward.

Neither does Discovery Communications Inc.  , despite  to buy Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  . The same goes for AMC Networks Inc.  and Viacom Inc.  . Time Warner Inc.didn't have one either, until CEO <person><nameText>Jeff Bewkes </nameText></person>convinced his board a year ago that the company needed to sell to AT&amp;T Inc.  .</p><p>Arguably, CBS Corp.  is building that relationship with All Access and Showtime, though even the path to lasting salvation for broadcast networks is paved with questions about demographics and the future of TV sports rights.</p><p>But back to Fox.</p><p>If CNBC's reporting of the potential transaction was in part of means of floating a trial balloon to gauge investor sentiment, the verdict is clear: The market likes this deal. Fox shares had sunk 5.4% this year before  on Monday, Nov. 6, that Fox officials had spoken with their Disney counterparts about selling their TV and film production studios, cable networks such as FX, the Star India networks and the company's 31% stake in European satellite TV operator Sky plc.</p><p>Disney also would acquire Fox's stake in Hulu LLC, the subscription platform jointly owned with Comcast Corp.  and Time Warner, riding recent momentum built off \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"</p><p>Fox and Disney representatives did not immediately return requests for comment on the deal talks.</p><p>Fox shares have surged 13.1% this week through Tuesday afternoon, to $28.25, in the wake of the report. Disney hasn't gained as much, but importantly, the shares have advanced. Disney is up 3.4% this week.</p><p>Fox in the above scenario would retain its broadcast network, its regional sports networks, the fast-growing FS1 sports channel, the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel and its TV broadcast affiliates. The Murdochs would be left with a trimmed-down company built around news and, especially, sports. Not to mention a lot of cash to build something new and, potentially, unencumbered by pay-TV or brick-and-mortar movie theaters. </p><p>The premise of the deal, though, is both astonishing and sobering. The Murdochs apparently have determined that Fox may not have the scale, or a logical path to scale, to compete in this next chapter of the global media and entertainment business. It failed three years ago to  and lost out back in 2011 in its bid to acquire the remainder of Sky it doesn't own. U.K. regulators may ultimately reject its  as well.</p><p>Of course, the outlines of media's future have been clear for a few years. Cord-cutting is putting the squeeze on cable networks while technology players are fast entering the content business, proving that anyone can make TV serials if they have a few extra billion dollars. And many do. Amazon.com Inc.  already has jumped into the film and TV business, and Apple Inc.  is building some kind of  . Facebook Inc.  just launched its  , and Alphabet Inc.'s  Google just started  , its digital television platform. </p><p>\"Big media companies are in this enormous transition between linear, where they controlled their own distribution, to a nonlinear, digital world where they have the opportunity at least to have a direct relationship with the consumer,\" Kelly said. \"But that costs a lot of money.\"</p><p>And money is something that Big Tech has in spades. Its players also have built direct-to-consumer platforms, leveraging their talent for technology in ways that Disney and Fox have been (very) slow to embrace. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google all have direct relationships with consumers. And so does Netflix Inc.  , of course. </p><p>Fox, despite its enormous TV and film production studios, remains beholden to pay-TV operators and movie theaters. That paradigm is slowly changing as Fox pushes more of its content to Hulu and 20th Century Fox president Stacey Snider calls to  between a film's release and its availability for streaming.</p><p>If Disney is willing to take cable networks FX, FXX and National Geographic in a deal headed by 20th Century Fox and its television studios, that would free the Murdochs of trying to figure out how to sustain a business under pressure from fewer subscribers and advertiser migration to Google and Facebook. Yet even then, FX may be too edgy for the Disney brand.</p><p>The deal essentially would cut Fox in half, according to Bernstein Research's Todd Juenger. Roughly $40 billion in assets would be sold to Disney, and roughly $40 billion in assets would remain at a slimmed-down Fox. (A related question is whether a reduced Fox would then remerge with News Corp.  )</p><p>Of course, there's a very real possibility that this transaction never occurs. Companies talk all the time. It's the fiduciary responsibility of top executives to forever contemplate mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>What is clear is that the Murdochs appear open to selling some of their businesses. There are lots of moving pieces in a company as larger as Fox, but apparently many of those pieces are in play. There's no reason an Apple or Amazon, or even CBS, wouldn't consider acquiring the 20th Century Fox film studio or its television studios. </p><p>It's very possible that these talks finally spark the M&amp;A wave that media industry observers have been expecting for years. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google already have crashed the party.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Comcast, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

U.S. billionaires worry about the survival of capitalism</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PALO ALTO, Calif. - A perfect California day. The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna, D-Calif., said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>US Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California speaks during a press conference following a vote in the US House on ending US military involvement in the war in Yemen, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, April 4, 2019.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference centre, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas' book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>Anand Giridharadas speak onstage at WIRED25 Festival: WIRED Celebrates 25th Anniversary - Day 2 on October 14, 2018 in San Francisco, California.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won . . . maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>Khanna saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, California, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favoured positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his grey suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' \"</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the grey suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders' revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p>\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna, D-Calif., said.</p><p>The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>US Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California speaks during a press conference following a vote in the US House on ending US military involvement in the war in Yemen, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, April 4, 2019.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference centre, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas' book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>Anand Giridharadas speak onstage at WIRED25 Festival: WIRED Celebrates 25th Anniversary - Day 2 on October 14, 2018 in San Francisco, California.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won . . . maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>Khanna saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>- - -</p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, California, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favoured positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his grey suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' \"</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the grey suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders' revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Lives depend on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not the sort of book a doctor should puzzle over, wondering, \u201cIs that a \u20181\u2019 or a \u20187\u2019 in the recommended dosage?\u201d But that is exactly the possibility that has haunted the guide\u2019s publisher, Antimicrobial Therapy, for the past two years as it confronted a flood of counterfeits \u2014 many of which were poorly printed and hard to read \u2014 in Amazon\u2019s vast bookstore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis threatens a bunch of patients \u2014 and our whole business,\u201d said Scott Kelly, the publisher\u2019s vice president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Kelly\u2019s problems arise directly from Amazon\u2019s domination of the book business. The company sells substantially more than half of the books in the United States, including new and used physical volumes as well as digital and audio formats. Amazon is also a platform for third-party sellers, a publisher, a printer, a self-publisher, a review hub, a textbook supplier and a distributor that now runs its own chain of brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>But Amazon takes a hands-off approach to what goes on in its bookstore, never checking the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells. It does not oversee the sellers who have flocked to its site in any organized way.</p><p>That has resulted in a kind of lawlessness. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild said counterfeiting of books on Amazon had surged. The company has been reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the issue, they said, often taking action only when a buyer complains. Many times, they added, there is nowhere to appeal and their only recourse is to integrate even more closely with Amazon.</p><p>The scope of counterfeiting across Amazon goes far beyond books. E-commerce has taken counterfeit goods from flea markets to the mainstream, and Amazon is by far the e-commerce heavyweight. But books offer a way to see the depths of the issue.</p><p>\u201cBeing a tech monopoly means you don\u2019t have to care about quality,\u201d said Bill Pollock, a San Francisco publisher who has dealt with fake versions of his firm\u2019s computer books on Amazon.</p><p>An Amazon spokeswoman denied that counterfeiting of books was a problem, saying, \u201cThis report cites a handful of complaints, but even a handful is too many and we will keep working until it\u2019s zero.\u201d The company said it strictly prohibited counterfeit products and last year denied accounts to more than one million suspected \u201cbad actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is strong competition amongst booksellers, from major retailers to independent booksellers,\u201d the spokeswoman added.</p><p>What happens after a tech giant dominates an industry is increasingly a question as lawmakers and regulators begin <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html\">taking a harder look at technology companies</url>, asking when dominance shades into a monopoly. This month, lawmakers in the House said they were scrutinizing the tech giants\u2019 possible anticompetitive behavior. And the Federal Trade Commission is specifically examining Amazon.</p><p>In Amazon\u2019s bookstore, the unruly behavior has been widespread, aided by print-on-demand technology. Booksellers that seem to have no verifiable existence outside Amazon offer $10 books for $100 or even $1,000 on the site, raising suspicions of algorithms run wild or even money-laundering. The problem of fake reviews is so bad that the F.T.C. has already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-brings-first-case-challenging-fake-paid-reviews-independent\">gotten involved</url>.</p><p>Those who write a popular book open themselves up to being \u201csummarized\u201d on Amazon. At least eight books purport to summarize <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bad+blood+summary&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2\">\u201cBad Blood,\u201d</url> John Carreyrou\u2019s best-selling account of fraud in Silicon Valley. The popular novel \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d has at least seven summaries. \u201cDiscover a beautiful coming-of-age story without all of the unnecessary information included in the actual novel!\u201d says one that has 19 five-star reviews, all of which read as if they were fake.</p><p>And then there are the counterfeits.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable and I\u2019m furious,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/agreer/status/1017428722104897536?lang=en\">the author Andrew Sean Greer tweeted</url> after people complained last summer that fakes of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u201cLess,\u201d were being sold as the real thing. There was a counterfeit edition of Danielle Trussoni\u2019s acclaimed memoir, \u201cFalling Through the Earth,\u201d on the site that misspelled her name on the cover. Lauren Groff       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/legroff/status/1017256634022629376\">tweeted that there was \u201can illegal paperback\u201d of \u201cFlorida,\u201d</url> her National Book Award nominee, on Amazon.</p><p>Dead writers get hit, too. Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Crucible\u201d was pirated. So was a volume of classic stories by Jorge Luis Borges. For 18 months Amazon has sold a counterfeit of Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d despite warnings in reader reviews that it is a \u201cmonstrosity,\u201d dispensing with such standard features as proofreading and paragraph indenting.</p><p>Technical books, which tend to be more expensive than fiction, are frequent victims. No Starch Press has tried to squelch fake editions of its computer manuals for three years. Mr. Pollock, No Starch\u2019s founder, said Amazon had the same laid-back approach to bad actors on its platform as Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>\u201cAmazon is the Wild Wild West,\u201d he said.</p><p>This is not really negligence on Amazon\u2019s part. It is the company\u2019s business model. Amazon, which does not break out revenue or profit from bookselling or publishing, assumes that everyone on its platform operates in good faith until proven otherwise. \u201cIt is your responsibility to ensure that your content doesn\u2019t violate laws or copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other rights,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200672390\">it tells prospective publishers and sellers</url>.</p><p>At Antimicrobial Therapy, the first warning that something was amiss with the Sanford Guide came with reviews on Amazon. \u201cSeveral pages smudged and unable to read,\u201d one buyer said in 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I4RQ9DWAASXJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1944272011\">posting photos as proof</url>. \u201cSeems as the book was photocopied,\u201d said a second. \u201cCharacters are smeared,\u201d wrote a third.</p><p>The company, whose books were sold to Amazon by distributors, did test buys. It got some copies from Amazon and others from its third-party sellers, including UsedText4u, Robinhood Book Foundation and 24x7 Book. Of the 34 books that Mr. Kelly bought, at least 30 were counterfeit. None of the booksellers responded to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Kelly spent hours writing responses to customers who complained about their copies but didn\u2019t realize they had counterfeits. He tried tracking down the source of the fakes and attempted to communicate with Amazon. Eventually he wrote to the retailer\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, saying, \u201cAmazon is knowingly and willfully fulfilling most orders for our title with counterfeits that may contain errors leading to injury or death of their patients.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Kelly got a response two weeks later from \u201cRaj,\u201d a member of \u201cthe Amazon Seller Performance team.\u201d Raj said that an unnamed third-party seller had been barred from selling the book but that the seller might now appeal directly to AMT, and that if the company wanted to retract the whole thing, here was what to do.</p><p>\u201cThey were very reluctant to actually engage with us about the problem,\u201d Mr. Kelly said of Amazon.</p><p>The Authors Guild said it was also seeing \u201ca massive rise\u201d in counterfeit books. \u201cAuthors tell us, \u2018I know I had more sales, but I don\u2019t see them in my royalties.\u2019\u201d said Mary Rasenberger, the guild\u2019s executive director. \u201cAmazon owns the reseller platform, and we think that\u2019s where these books are being sold.\u201d</p><p>In February, Amazon included counterfeiting in its financial disclosures as a risk factor <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1542839/amazon-has-finally-admitted-to-investors-that-it-has-a-counterfeit-problem/\">for the first time</url>, saying it might not be able to prevent its merchants \u201cfrom selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated or stolen goods\u201d or \u201cselling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner.\u201d</p><p>Yet the company has such a grip on books that counterfeits do not seem to harm it. They might even increase its business.</p><p>\u201cA book takes a year or more to write,\u201d said Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Bookshelf, a North Carolina publisher of computer books that had at least one of its titles stolen. \u201cBut to steal the book and upload it to Amazon takes only a minute. As the expression goes, there\u2019s a low cost of entry.\u201d</p><p>And when someone buys a counterfeit, Mr. Hunt added, the real author may get cheated but Amazon still makes a sale. \u201cYou could ask, What\u2019s their incentive to do something?\u201d he said.</p><p>A dream turns into something else</p><p>Amazon fulfilled Jamie Lendino\u2019s dream of becoming an author.</p><p>A computer buff who delights in the digital past, Mr. Lendino, 45, wrote a book called \u201cBreakout,\u201d about the Atari machines of the 1980s that ushered in a new era of gaming. He self-published it two years ago through Amazon, which charged him nothing upfront but took a commission on the 1,223 paperback copies bought by devoted Atari fans.</p><p>Then Amazon fulfilled someone\u2019s dream of becoming Jamie Lendino.</p><p>A fellow purportedly named Steve S. Thomas took Mr. Lendino\u2019s book a year ago and remade it as his own. Mr. Thomas got rid of the title \u201cBreakout\u201d and converted the subtitle \u2014 \u201cHow Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation\u201d \u2014 into the title. He put on a new cover and substituted his name for Mr. Lendino\u2019s, although he kept all of Mr. Lendino\u2019s biographical details about being the editor of ExtremeTech.com and writing for PC Magazine and Popular Science.</p><p>It was the latest entry in Mr. Thomas\u2019s substantial body of work. He also put his name on scholarly and expensive books like \u201cPreharvest and Postharvest Food Safety\u201d and \u201cReal-World Electronic Voting: Design, Analysis and Deployment,\u201d none of which he had actually written.</p><p>Mr. Thomas\u2019s plagiarism of Mr. Lendino brought his caper to a close. Kevin Savetz, another Atari buff, spotted \u201cHow Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation.\u201d He ordered it, although, as he noted, \u201cthe title seemed a little familiar.\u201d</p><p>When Mr. Savetz got the book, he realized it was more than familiar and tweeted at Mr. Lendino, who was surprised someone was stealing from him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to counterfeit a book, you\u2019d pick something by Dan Brown or Neil Gaiman,\u201d Mr. Lendino said. \u201cYou don\u2019t pick a tech guy writing about a 40-year-old computer.\u201d</p><p>Things got weirder. Allison Tartalia, Mr. Lendino\u2019s wife, was browsing on Amazon as all this was happening when she saw that a 152-page biography of her husband had recently been published.</p><p>\u201cI was like, \u2018Honey? Someone apparently knows something about you that I don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Tartalia said.</p><p>She ordered a copy of the biography, which had been put together by two entrepreneurs using a rudimentary artificial intelligence program scraping material from the internet. So far, they seem to have produced 3,000 of them, including titles such as \u201cDick Hardt, Identity Guy at Amazon Web Services.\u201d They sell for $15, though sales seem to be rare <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pharaoh-Francis-Novelist-fantasy-paranormal/product-reviews/B07PDZKZ7Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&amp;reviewerType=all_reviews\">and satisfied customers even rarer.</url></p><p>After Mr. Lendino complained to Amazon about the counterfeit, the retailer wiped Mr. Thomas\u2019s oeuvre from its store. Only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39959098-preharvest-and-postharvest-food-safety\">the faintest traces</url> of him remain. He could not be reached for comment because he probably does not exist. Amazon declined to comment.</p><p>Ms. Tartalia never received her biography of her husband. The book is listed as \u201ccurrently unavailable.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lendino holds no grudges against Amazon. \u201cIt was truly amazing that I could publish a book without walking into a lot of bookstores and asking them to carry it, or printing a lot of inventory and having to run online web sales myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>Last year, he used Amazon\u2019s self-publishing platform to issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Atari-2600-Console-Gaming/dp/1732355207/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Jamie+lendino&amp;qid=1560294239&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">\u201cAdventure,\u201d</url> about the Atari 2600.</p><p>\u2018Amazon has done it again\u2019</p><p>Some counterfeit books, like Mr. Thomas\u2019s, are wholly made on Amazon. Sometimes they come from elsewhere.</p><p>One example is \u201cThe Art of Assembly Language,\u201d an older computer manual published by No Starch Press. It ended up counterfeited and on Amazon after a sequence of maneuvers that began last November.</p><p>That month, a counterfeiter sent 11 digital files \u2014 including \u201cThe Art of Assembly Language\u201d \u2014 to IngramSpark, a print-on-demand publisher in Tennessee. Once the scammer was finished with the minimal paperwork, IngramSpark had 11 new books.</p><p>The titles became part of the distribution network of IngramSpark\u2019s parent company, Ingram Content Group, which supplies thousands of retailers with physical books of all types. IngramSpark printed and sold 56 copies of \u201cThe Art of the Assembly Language\u201d over the next three months. Amazon ordered many of them.</p><p>In January, a keen-eyed customer tipped off No Starch that the book did not look right. The counterfeits, listed for $48, were larger than the real thing, which put the cover noticeably out of alignment. Amazon featured the fakes in its product photo.</p><p>\u201cAmazon has done it again,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/billpollock/status/1091501782692327424\">Mr. Pollock tweeted</url>.</p><p>In late 2016, No Starch had found a counterfeit of one of its books, \u201cThe Linux Command Line,\u201d on Amazon. A few months later, it happened again with \u201cPython for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming\u201d and, the publisher said, at least three others.</p><p>Phil Ollila, chief content officer of Ingram Content Group, acknowledged that he had not told No Starch, the copyright owner, that its rights were violated. \u201cThat seems like the polite thing to do, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p><p>That was just one of No Starch\u2019s problems on Amazon.</p><p>No Starch publishes \u201cPython Crash Course,\u201d a how-to guide to the Python programming language. Anyone searching those three words recently on Amazon would have seen several self-published books, often \u201csponsored\u201d \u2014 that is, advertised \u2014 so they would be perched at the top of the search page.</p><p>One book, also called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Programming-Cheatsheet/dp/1717716482/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=Python+Crash+Course&amp;qid=1561092246&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-23\">\u201cPython Crash Course,\u201d</url> is an entirely dubious effort. On its front cover is a distorted logo appropriated from the respected publisher McGraw Hill but subtly changed to \u201cRcGraw Hill.\u201d</p><p>The book features a biography of Alexis Jordan, its purported author, on the back cover that was stolen from the popular suspense writer Dean Koontz. (\u201cHis novels are broadly described as suspense thrillers,\u201d etc.) Inside, there is a completely different biography plagiarized from J\u00fcrgen Scheible, a German media artist.</p><p>Mr. Scheible said he was dismayed to learn that his life had been stolen. \u201cThis has shaken my trust in Amazon and its future,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWhere are they going if they are so negligent that a thing like this book and other such books can happen for real?\u201d</p><p>Amazon sells \u201cPython Crash Course\u201d for $7. The No Starch book goes for $28.</p><p>\u201cTheir book is a joke, but it will sucker some people into thinking they\u2019re buying a cheaper version of my book,\u201d Mr. Pollock said.</p><p>Bait-and-switch schemes are common in the Amazon bookstore. If someone wants to title a book of self-published poetry \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d \u2014 and someone did \u2014 Amazon will sell it next to Harper Lee\u2019s classic novel. Some customers wrote in Amazon reviews that they felt tricked by the author of the verse \u201cMockingbird,\u201d whose many other titles include \u201cWar and Peace\u201d and \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d</p><p>In February, Amazon introduced a plan called Project Zero. No longer would brands have to report counterfeits and wait for the retailer to investigate. Project Zero, Amazon said, would give brands \u201can unprecedented ability to directly control and remove listings.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pollock said Project Zero was a further insult. \u201cWhy should we be responsible for policing Amazon for fakes?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their job.\u201d</p><p>But No Starch still needs to keep its books ahead of the imitators and knockoffs. So in November, it began advertising on Amazon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about $3,000 a month and rising,\u201d Mr. Pollock said. \u201cI need to keep my books on the first page of results.\u201d</p><p>Rewarding Amazon\u2019s dominance</p><p>The Sanford antimicrobial guide has its roots in the work of Jay Sanford, the chief of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas in the 1960s and later the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. There is now a digital version, but many doctors prefer the familiar printed format.</p><p>Antimicrobial Therapy is run today by Jeb Sanford, Jay\u2019s son; his wife, Dianne; and Mr. Kelly, who is Dianne\u2019s son and Jeb\u2019s stepson. It is a small operation, only 13 employees working out of a large barnlike building in Sperryville, Va., on the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p><p>The company declined to disclose its annual revenue, but the Sanford Guide is its principal product. Sales of the book have drifted lower the past few years, with a downward spike in 2018.</p><p>In retrospect, this was probably a clue to the growing abundance of fakes. \u201cMy estimate is that approximately 15 to 25 percent of our sales were taken away by counterfeiting,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands of books.\u201d</p><p>After the guide is printed, all copies go to Sperryville. They are then shipped to wholesalers, retailers and individual buyers. The wholesalers sell the book to Amazon. Third-party sellers on Amazon acquire their stock in several ways. One seller of a counterfeit copy told Mr. Kelly that she had bought the book from Amazon in one of its periodic sell-offs of damaged and returned books.</p><p>Sellers on Amazon can pool their goods with the same exact goods offered by Amazon itself, a practice known as commingling. This has advantages for sellers \u2014 less processing is needed, so it\u2019s cheaper \u2014 but it also explains how Amazon can unknowingly ship counterfeits despite getting stock directly from the printer.</p><p>Some of the counterfeits appear to have been copied by scanning. That process can easily introduce numerical errors, especially with a typeface as small as the handbook\u2019s. \u201cThere are versions of our text out in the world over which we had no control,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.</p><p>The company filed complaints with Amazon about counterfeiting last fall. The bookseller ultimately removed many of the resellers, some of whom then went to Antimicrobial Therapy and complained that they were innocent. Amazon declined to comment on the publisher.</p><p>The communications impasse between Amazon and Antimicrobial Therapy was complicated by the fact that they did not have a direct relationship. So in December, AMT opened <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=&amp;isCBA=&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;orderID=&amp;seller=A39XAJRRNO9XB2&amp;tab=&amp;vasStoreID=\">a vendor site on Amazon</url>, with the bookseller getting a commission of about 20 percent on each copy sold. Under this arrangement, Amazon tells Antimicrobial Therapy where the customer lives, and the publisher ships the book from Sperryville.</p><p>As AMT was getting ready this spring to release the 2019 guide, it proposed an even deeper integration with Amazon.</p><p>\u201cTo eliminate the possibility of Amazon facilitating the sale of counterfeit books, we would like to offer Amazon the opportunity to serve as a wholesaler of our titles, cutting out the middle man,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote to the company.</p><p>It was, in essence, rewarding Amazon by surrendering to its dominance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d rather not be on Amazon,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cBut we felt like we didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld. </p><p>PHOTO: Antimicrobial Therapy, which publishes \u201cThe Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,\u201d bought 34 of its handbooks from Amazon and Amazon\u2019s third-party sellers. At least 30 were counterfeits.

That goes quadruple for Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc.<br/><br/>On the upside, these U.S. tech giants provide some of the world\u2019s best-loved products and services. Investors love them, too. They\u2019re the first-, second-, fourth-, and fifth-most-valuable companies. (Microsoft Corp. places third.)</p><p><br/><br/>Yet the four, taken together, also stand widely accused of the sins associated with corporate bullies: crushing competition, avoiding taxes, undermining democracy and invading privacy. Russian operatives have used American social media companies as a playground. Executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter Inc. told Congress on Oct. 31 that they can\u2019t even measure the extent of Russia\u2019s manipulation of the U.S. presidential election and don\u2019t yet have the tools to stop it the next time.<br/><br/>The result, so far, has been threats of new taxes, regulations, laws and antitrust actions\u2014not only in Europe, where the giants have long been treated as problems, but increasingly from what has been long seen as the more hands-off U.S. government. Some experts see the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&amp;T Inc.\u2019s purchase of Time Warner Inc. as a possible precursor of actions against the tech giants. Even the experts are confused. Are these companies our friends, enemies or frenemies? Are they basically familiar entities that can be dealt with using tried-and-true remedies\u2014or something new that requires a fresh approach?<br/><br/>\u201cWe are living through a moment in which the forms of our legal institutions are being revealed to us as obsolete,\" said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown Law School who is working on a book about rethinking antitrust law for the new era of powerful online platforms. \u201cOur regulatory institutions date to the early 20th century. They were created in response to particular problems. They\u2019re not timeless.\"<br/><br/>Part of the difficulty is that, right now at least, every allegation against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple Inc. is weighed as a separate matter. That doesn\u2019t make sense economically. Actions against each one, taken in combination, could result in death or diminution by a thousand cuts. Or, at the other extreme, the big four could manage to escape serious reform by exploiting the authorities\u2019 lack of coordination the way LeBron James splits defenders on his way to the hoop.<br/><br/>So it\u2019s important to think holistically about these tech giants. To do that, we collected some of the best thinking about what regulators could do, stopping to consider the possible consequences. We made sure to include cases wherein it makes sense simply to back off and leave them alone.<br/><br/>If regulators wanted to fix the playing field, would Google become five Googlettes? Should Facebook become a regulated utility, treated more like your local phone company than your favorite social network? Could Amazon.com be barred from selling its own books, movies and TV shows to protect other sellers on its all-powerful platform? Do governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple\u2019s nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?<br/><br/>No one knows, of course, but it\u2019s still valuable to think through possible actions and consequences. Here, then, are scenarios in which regulators and politicians might try to tame four of the most valuable companies on the planet.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>When people worry that companies are too powerful, the first impulse is to reach back into trust-busting history and break them into pieces, just as when Standard Oil was splintered into 34 independent companies in 1911. A breakup hasn\u2019t shattered a major U.S. company in more than three decades.<br/><br/>The last big breakup came in 1982, after the Justice Department entered into a consent decree with what was then called American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. As a result, on the first day of 1984, Ma Bell spawned seven regional Baby Bells to provide local and regional phone service. The rump company that retained the AT&amp;T name provided long-distance service and manufactured equipment.<br/><br/>The result of the split was generally positive: first cheaper long-distance calls, then the mobile-phone revolution. The Baby Bells eventually escaped some regulatory restraints. But there were losses, too: Bell Laboratories, a visionary research and development center that gave birth to the transistor and the laser, couldn\u2019t be sustained without monopoly profits.<br/><br/>Google\u2014or rather its parent company, Alphabet\u2014is the tech giant that most frequently inspires imagined breakup scenarios. An op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year dared to pose the question in a headline: \u201cIs It Time to Break Up Google?\" So let\u2019s use the case of Google to evaluate the argument for chopping up any overgrown tech company.<br/><br/>Just as Ma Bell\u2019s demise doomed Bell Labs, the disintegration of Google would probably spell the end to Google X, the R&amp;D operation that calls itself a \u201cmoonshot factory\" and is working on everything from balloon-based internet service to fuel from seawater. Presumably its researchers would carry on elsewhere, perhaps with less generous funding.<br/><br/>Breaking up Google by regions, as happened to AT&amp;T, wouldn\u2019t work because Google isn\u2019t organized that way. An alternative would be to split Google into, say, five smaller companies that would be quite similar to one another. Call them Google, Hoogle, Ioogle, Joogle and Koogle. They might compete by charging less for advertising, which is by far Google\u2019s main revenue source. That would presumably benefit advertisers and, eventually, consumers.<br/><br/>But five little Googlettes might not last any longer on their own than the seven Baby Bells did. If there are economies of scale and a winner-take-all tendency, one of the little five could soon come to dominate the others.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>A more logical breakup of Google would be along functional lines. Search could be walled off as a stand-alone business, with its own shareholders, to prevent Alphabet from favoring its own products over those of rivals in search results. The sky-high profits generated from search-related ads would no longer be able to subsidize the invasion of other market segments. In a classic antitrust case, the monopoly part of the business would then be subject to price regulation.<br/><br/>The problem with price regulation is that Google doesn\u2019t charge high prices\u2014at least not to consumers, the traditional victims in monopoly cases. The company initially helped wipe out the profitability of newspapers and magazines, in part, by undercutting the price of print advertising. These days, however, Google can charge hefty prices to advertisers because it controls so much inventory and user data. Advertisers can feel they have no choice but to pay up, while consumers pay precisely zero to do searches or send emails.<br/><br/>Critics of the tech giants have started to argue that current antitrust policy is blinkered by the emphasis on direct harm to consumers beyond other anti-competitive behaviors. Companies can do evil, even if their prices are low\u2014if they acquire too much political power, for instance, or smother new ideas and kill small businesses.<br/><br/>Enforcing antitrust law isn\u2019t a cure-all. \u201cThere are attempts to try to give the antitrust courts a quasi-executive mandate to go across the terrain and fix every problem they encounter,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and Law School. Some concerns might be better dealt with other ways, he said, such as campaign finance reform.<br/><br/>As an alternative to breakup, trustbusters could limit themselves to forcing Alphabet to split off some of the acquisitions financed with its near-monopoly profits. In contrast to trying to regulate preferential treatment between business units inside a big company, \u201cstructural separation is just cleaner and neater,\" said Lina Khan, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School.<br/><br/>YouTube and Waze could be shed relatively easily. It would be harder to break off such businesses as DoubleClick, which have been tightly integrated into Google\u2019s business. In June, to take one example, the European Union fined Google 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) for favoring its own comparison-shopping service in search results. Rather than spin off its shopping service to placate the EU, Google is putting it in a stand-alone unit and requiring it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page.<br/><br/>But breaking up a company is an extreme measure\u2014almost the corporate equivalent of a death sentence\u2014and the benefits are unclear. That\u2019s why even some of the most assertive foes of tech giants shy away from calling for outright dismemberment.<br/><br/>Even Jonathan Taplin, author of the Times op-ed asking if it\u2019s time to break up Google, never answered affirmatively. He called for something considerably short of that: requiring Google to license its patents freely, as the U.S. required AT&amp;T to do in a 1956 consent decree. Another solution favored by Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who\u2019s been a nemesis of Big Tech, focuses on getting Google to treat rivals better in search results.<br/><br/>Barry Lynn, who runs an advocacy group called Open Markets Institute and has been an outspoken critic of Google, says platform companies should be treated like railroads and forbidden from going into businesses in which they compete with their customers.<br/><br/>If Google and its brethren get any bigger and more powerful, we might eventually see an antitrust action along these lines. It\u2019s tricky, though, since hampering one of these giants could backfire by making it easier for another to expand. \u201cYou hate to cripple any one of them, and you hate to discourage them from attacking one another,\" said Scott Hemphill, a visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law.<br/><br/>If breaking up a tech giant is hard, another class of remedy would be to assert more control over a giant\u2019s behavior. This second category can also apply to Google, Facebook and Apple, but let\u2019s focus on what it might do to Amazon.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>The world has a love-hate relationship with Amazon. Consumers mainly love it, competitors hate it and the government is pulled in both directions. Almost 240 cities are vying to host the second U.S. headquarters of a company that many of them have condemned for putting local retailers out of business.<br/><br/>Amazon is a \u201ccheetelephant,\" said one analyst: an elephant that runs as fast as a cheetah. It\u2019s considerably faster than the regulators and lawmakers who have been caught flat-footed and are now wondering what, if anything, to do about its increasing market power, from books to groceries to moviemaking.<br/><br/>In a widely read article in the January issue of the Yale Law Journal entitled \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox</url> ,\" Yale\u2019s Khan laid out the two main options for dealing with Amazon and other companies that run on online platform markets, such as Google and Facebook. One is to discipline them via competition, relying on antitrust law to make sure they don\u2019t put competitors out of business. The other is to throw in the towel on competition and \u201caccept that they are inherently monopolistic or oligopolistic and regulate them instead.\" You\u2019d pursue the second option if you thought there were such important economies of scale that it made sense for Amazon to be huge, even dominant. In that case you\u2019d let it grow, Khan wrote, \u201cwhile neutering the firm\u2019s ability to exploit its dominance.\"<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>For those who want to rely on the competition solution, a key problem is coming up with a standard for judging when Amazon is competing unfairly. Let\u2019s say Amazon slashes prices. Is that a \u201cpredatory\" move designed to drive a competitor out of business and clear the way to raise prices and profits? Or is it just aggressive pricing by a company that has no intention of raising prices in the future?<br/><br/>\u201cIf you look at the business models of these firms, none of these is a predatory pricing model. These firms are making a lot of money doing what they\u2019re currently doing,\" said Penn\u2019s Hovenkamp. Besides, he said, \u201cthere are constantly new entrants\" that would prevent a company from earning monopolistic profits. For antitrust enforcers, the problem is that by the time you know for sure whether a company predatorily drove rivals out of business, it\u2019s too late to prevent it.<br/><br/>If the choice is to accept rather than fight Amazon\u2019s dominance, one traditional solution would be to regulate Amazon the same as the local electricity, gas, water or sewer utilities. That would involve treating it like a \u201ccommon carrier,\" meaning it would be barred from favoring its own products over those of competitors by, say, displaying them more prominently. <br/><br/>Short of that, Amazon\u2019s network could be declared an \u201cessential facility,\" meaning Amazon would have to let any competitor use its platform without question. Khan argues that Amazon\u2019s delivery service, its Marketplace and Amazon Web Services could all come to be considered essential facilities someday, \u201cin light of the company\u2019s current trajectory.\"<br/><br/>\u201cEssential\" is kind of a stretch, at least for now. Vendors don\u2019t have to use the Amazon Marketplace if they don\u2019t want to, and there are plenty of other choices for cloud providers.<br/><br/>Customers might not notice much change right away if Amazon\u2019s various platforms were declared essential facilities that are open to everyone. After all, other companies already account for half the items sold on Amazon Marketplace. But over time, the reliability of merchandise sold through Amazon might decline if the company had to accept all vendors, including crappy ones.<br/><br/>Another option, designating Amazon as a common carrier, would let regulators control what Amazon charges vendors for appearing on its site or using its delivery service. There again, the change might not be immediately apparent to customers, especially if regulators stepped in only to halt obviously unfair treatment.<br/><br/>So far we\u2019ve looked at a breakup solution for Google and a regulation solution for Amazon. The Google breakup seems far-fetched, and the result of our Amazon regulation scenario is underwhelming. What else? Another solution that\u2019s being floated is to hold companies liable for the things that happen on their platforms. Let\u2019s see how that would play out for Facebook.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>None other than British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of treating Facebook, Google and Twitter like news organizations, making them responsible for content appearing on their platforms. In the U.S. Senate, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) would expose internet companies such as Facebook and Google to civil lawsuits over content created by their customers. There\u2019s a similar bill in the House.<br/><br/>To turn Facebook into a publisher, Congress would have to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The section protects social networks from lawsuits over content created by others. There\u2019s also a Good Samaritan provision, which says that if the companies do choose to kill some offensive customer-created content, they don\u2019t thereby lose their legal protection and become responsible for every other bad thing customers do on their platforms.<br/><br/>Notice how making Facebook liable for customers\u2019 content is very different\u2014opposite, really\u2014from the solution of making it and others into common carriers. A common carrier, such as a plain vanilla phone company, submits to regulation of its prices and terms of service but has pretty much complete immunity against lawsuits over customers\u2019 behavior. No one holds the phone company responsible for things people say to each other on the phone.<br/><br/>It\u2019s clear that the government isn\u2019t willing to excuse Facebook for the content that has appeared on its site, from animal abuse to live-streamed suicides. The company has become far more aggressive about rooting out offensive material, including fake news, sex-trafficking and hate speech. By monitoring itself, it\u2019s hoping to dodge government control.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>But that\u2019s creating a whole new set of problems, including backlash from customers and activists, who say Facebook is setting itself up as an unofficial censor. Right-leaning groups accuse Facebook of a liberal bias. Facebook considers itself a marketplace of ideas and rails against the notion that it's a media company. Some critics are asserting a First Amendment right to free speech on Facebook, saying that it has become, in effect, a public space. They cite a 1946 Supreme Court decision, Marsh v. Alabama, that said a state trespassing statute couldn\u2019t prevent distribution of religious materials on the sidewalk, even in a privately owned company town.<br/><br/>\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build,\" Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote in October. \u201cWhen the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.\"<br/><br/>Facebook, in other words, is damned if it does censor and damned if it doesn\u2019t. How is this likely to evolve? One possibility is that Facebook will tire of taking the heat and voluntarily submit to government regulation. John Battelle, a tech writer and entrepreneur who helped launch Wired and the Industry Standard, has argued for just this approach.<br/><br/>A regulated Facebook would still have to employ people and algorithms to scour its website of forbidden materials, as it does today, but at least it could point the finger at lawmakers and regulators if questioned about its choices. The same would go for Google and some companies not covered here, such as Twitter.<br/><br/>But as troubling as censorship by Facebook is, censorship by the government could turn out worse: \u201cA lot of the people who say, \u2018Well, these tech giants ought to be regulated,\u2019 are also people who are quite critical of the current government. They haven\u2019t really thought through what it means to give more regulatory tools to a government they disapprove of,\" said Michael Godwin, a tech law veteran who is director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank.<br/><br/>That brings us to Apple, which differs from the others in that it\u2019s not mainly a platform company making money by bringing together friends and advertisers or suppliers and customers. Many of the issues that affect Google, Amazon and Facebook are less important for Apple. But one\u2014taxation\u2014is huge for Apple and important for all four companies.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, finished its last fiscal year with $216 billion in cash and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As Congress looks under the seat cushions for spare change, Apple\u2019s foreign treasure is a tempting target\u2014especially since, in reality, the money is mostly held in the U.S. in dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds.<br/><br/>Right now Apple doesn\u2019t have to pay U.S. tax on profits earned abroad until it \u201crepatriates\" the money, by paying a dividend or benefiting shareholders in some other way. Tax bills under consideration call for changing that system, taxing the entire sum now, although at preferential rates\u20147 percent to 14 percent in the House plan and 5 percent to 10 percent in the Senate's. The economic rationale for the super-low rates is shaky. In principle, although it\u2019s highly unlikely, nothing is stopping Congress from charging companies the entire 35 percent they owe.<br/><br/>The Europeans are even more exercised than the Americans over how hard it is to tax Apple and the other tech giants. The European Commission claims that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed it to pay an effective tax rate in 2014 of just 0.005 percent on its European profits. In 2016, it ordered Ireland to collect as much as 13 billion euros in back taxes from Apple. Ireland, which uses a low tax rate to attract business, has balked. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission\u2019s order \u201ctotal political crap,\" saying his company had paid its fair share of taxes.<br/><br/>Until recently, tech companies have had lots of ways to minimize their taxes legally. The general idea has been to take advantage of transfer-pricing rules by deeming as much of your profits as possible to have been earned in a low-tax jurisdiction such as Ireland. But the Europeans are tightening those loopholes. Aside from the Apple case, Amazon this year was also ordered to pay 250 million euros in back taxes to Luxembourg.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a good bet that there will be more such orders in coming years. Governments want money, and the four tech giants have a lot of it. In the meantime, while trying to come up with a better tax system, Europe is toying with the idea of taxing the tech companies\u2019 revenue rather than their profits. The reasoning is that revenue is harder to manipulate. But revenue is a crude measure of a company\u2019s ability to pay taxes. Revenue-based taxation would be too hard on companies with lots of revenue but little profit, and too easy on companies with little revenue but lots of profit. \u201cI liken it to a drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there,\" said Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. \u201cThe mere fact that it\u2019s easier to measure revenue doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to tax.\"<br/><br/>What would be smarter would be changing the tax code to take away the incentive for companies to attribute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Some Europeans are discussing an idea of splitting a company\u2019s worldwide tax liability among countries, according to how much revenue the company derives in each country. Assets or employment in a country could also be used as yardsticks. This column from September explains the basic concept:<br/><br/>Under an apportionment system, each country is still permitted to set its corporate tax rate however it chooses. But it will be able to charge its rate only on its little slice of the company\u2019s global profit\u2014a slice that\u2019s determined by an agreed-upon formula. A country can no longer grab a bigger piece of a shrinking corporate-tax pie by cutting its rate below other countries\u2019. In one stroke, the race to the bottom in tax rates is cut short.<br/><br/>The European Commission raised the idea in 2011 and again in 2016 in the form of something called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. \"It's an amazing change. Ten years ago nobody talked about this,\" said Jose Antonio Ocampo, a Columbia University professor and former Colombian finance minister who is chairman of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.<br/><br/>Getting low-tax countries to go along with an apportionment system would be tough, though. No country wants to give up what makes it special. So something like the current tax system, albeit with fewer loopholes, is likely to persist for at least awhile. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon will keep finding ways to pit countries against one another.<br/><br/>As the four tech giants grow and invade each other\u2019s turf, it may turn out that the strongest force preventing them from abusing the public is the force of competition\u2014i.e., each other.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SQLSER-357190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SQLSER2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2V-2M91-DY2V-D3H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SQL Server Pro</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 30, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

That goes quadruple for Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc.<br/><br/>On the upside, these U.S. tech giants provide some of the world\u2019s best-loved products and services. Investors love them, too. They\u2019re the first-, second-, fourth-, and fifth-most-valuable companies. (Microsoft Corp. places third.)</p><p><br/><br/>Yet the four, taken together, also stand widely accused of the sins associated with corporate bullies: crushing competition, avoiding taxes, undermining democracy and invading privacy. Russian operatives have used American social media companies as a playground. Executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter Inc. told Congress on Oct. 31 that they can\u2019t even measure the extent of Russia\u2019s manipulation of the U.S. presidential election and don\u2019t yet have the tools to stop it the next time.<br/><br/>The result, so far, has been threats of new taxes, regulations, laws and antitrust actions\u2014not only in Europe, where the giants have long been treated as problems, but increasingly from what has been long seen as the more hands-off U.S. government. Some experts see the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&amp;T Inc.\u2019s purchase of Time Warner Inc. as a possible precursor of actions against the tech giants. Even the experts are confused. Are these companies our friends, enemies or frenemies? Are they basically familiar entities that can be dealt with using tried-and-true remedies\u2014or something new that requires a fresh approach?<br/><br/>\u201cWe are living through a moment in which the forms of our legal institutions are being revealed to us as obsolete,\" said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown Law School who is working on a book about rethinking antitrust law for the new era of powerful online platforms. \u201cOur regulatory institutions date to the early 20th century. They were created in response to particular problems. They\u2019re not timeless.\"<br/><br/>Part of the difficulty is that, right now at least, every allegation against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple Inc. is weighed as a separate matter. That doesn\u2019t make sense economically. Actions against each one, taken in combination, could result in death or diminution by a thousand cuts. Or, at the other extreme, the big four could manage to escape serious reform by exploiting the authorities\u2019 lack of coordination the way LeBron James splits defenders on his way to the hoop.<br/><br/>So it\u2019s important to think holistically about these tech giants. To do that, we collected some of the best thinking about what regulators could do, stopping to consider the possible consequences. We made sure to include cases wherein it makes sense simply to back off and leave them alone.<br/><br/>If regulators wanted to fix the playing field, would Google become five Googlettes? Should Facebook become a regulated utility, treated more like your local phone company than your favorite social network? Could Amazon.com be barred from selling its own books, movies and TV shows to protect other sellers on its all-powerful platform? Do governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple\u2019s nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?<br/><br/>No one knows, of course, but it\u2019s still valuable to think through possible actions and consequences. Here, then, are scenarios in which regulators and politicians might try to tame four of the most valuable companies on the planet.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>When people worry that companies are too powerful, the first impulse is to reach back into trust-busting history and break them into pieces, just as when Standard Oil was splintered into 34 independent companies in 1911. A breakup hasn\u2019t shattered a major U.S. company in more than three decades.<br/><br/>The last big breakup came in 1982, after the Justice Department entered into a consent decree with what was then called American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. As a result, on the first day of 1984, Ma Bell spawned seven regional Baby Bells to provide local and regional phone service. The rump company that retained the AT&amp;T name provided long-distance service and manufactured equipment.<br/><br/>The result of the split was generally positive: first cheaper long-distance calls, then the mobile-phone revolution. The Baby Bells eventually escaped some regulatory restraints. But there were losses, too: Bell Laboratories, a visionary research and development center that gave birth to the transistor and the laser, couldn\u2019t be sustained without monopoly profits.<br/><br/>Google\u2014or rather its parent company, Alphabet\u2014is the tech giant that most frequently inspires imagined breakup scenarios. An op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year dared to pose the question in a headline: \u201cIs It Time to Break Up Google?\" So let\u2019s use the case of Google to evaluate the argument for chopping up any overgrown tech company.<br/><br/>Just as Ma Bell\u2019s demise doomed Bell Labs, the disintegration of Google would probably spell the end to Google X, the R&amp;D operation that calls itself a \u201cmoonshot factory\" and is working on everything from balloon-based internet service to fuel from seawater. Presumably its researchers would carry on elsewhere, perhaps with less generous funding.<br/><br/>Breaking up Google by regions, as happened to AT&amp;T, wouldn\u2019t work because Google isn\u2019t organized that way. An alternative would be to split Google into, say, five smaller companies that would be quite similar to one another. Call them Google, Hoogle, Ioogle, Joogle and Koogle. They might compete by charging less for advertising, which is by far Google\u2019s main revenue source. That would presumably benefit advertisers and, eventually, consumers.<br/><br/>But five little Googlettes might not last any longer on their own than the seven Baby Bells did. If there are economies of scale and a winner-take-all tendency, one of the little five could soon come to dominate the others.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>A more logical breakup of Google would be along functional lines. Search could be walled off as a stand-alone business, with its own shareholders, to prevent Alphabet from favoring its own products over those of rivals in search results. The sky-high profits generated from search-related ads would no longer be able to subsidize the invasion of other market segments. In a classic antitrust case, the monopoly part of the business would then be subject to price regulation.<br/><br/>The problem with price regulation is that Google doesn\u2019t charge high prices\u2014at least not to consumers, the traditional victims in monopoly cases. The company initially helped wipe out the profitability of newspapers and magazines, in part, by undercutting the price of print advertising. These days, however, Google can charge hefty prices to advertisers because it controls so much inventory and user data. Advertisers can feel they have no choice but to pay up, while consumers pay precisely zero to do searches or send emails.<br/><br/>Critics of the tech giants have started to argue that current antitrust policy is blinkered by the emphasis on direct harm to consumers beyond other anti-competitive behaviors. Companies can do evil, even if their prices are low\u2014if they acquire too much political power, for instance, or smother new ideas and kill small businesses.<br/><br/>Enforcing antitrust law isn\u2019t a cure-all. \u201cThere are attempts to try to give the antitrust courts a quasi-executive mandate to go across the terrain and fix every problem they encounter,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and Law School. Some concerns might be better dealt with other ways, he said, such as campaign finance reform.<br/><br/>As an alternative to breakup, trustbusters could limit themselves to forcing Alphabet to split off some of the acquisitions financed with its near-monopoly profits. In contrast to trying to regulate preferential treatment between business units inside a big company, \u201cstructural separation is just cleaner and neater,\" said Lina Khan, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School.<br/><br/>YouTube and Waze could be shed relatively easily. It would be harder to break off such businesses as DoubleClick, which have been tightly integrated into Google\u2019s business. In June, to take one example, the European Union fined Google 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) for favoring its own comparison-shopping service in search results. Rather than spin off its shopping service to placate the EU, Google is putting it in a stand-alone unit and requiring it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page.<br/><br/>But breaking up a company is an extreme measure\u2014almost the corporate equivalent of a death sentence\u2014and the benefits are unclear. That\u2019s why even some of the most assertive foes of tech giants shy away from calling for outright dismemberment.<br/><br/>Even Jonathan Taplin, author of the Times op-ed asking if it\u2019s time to break up Google, never answered affirmatively. He called for something considerably short of that: requiring Google to license its patents freely, as the U.S. required AT&amp;T to do in a 1956 consent decree. Another solution favored by Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who\u2019s been a nemesis of Big Tech, focuses on getting Google to treat rivals better in search results.<br/><br/>Barry Lynn, who runs an advocacy group called Open Markets Institute and has been an outspoken critic of Google, says platform companies should be treated like railroads and forbidden from going into businesses in which they compete with their customers.<br/><br/>If Google and its brethren get any bigger and more powerful, we might eventually see an antitrust action along these lines. It\u2019s tricky, though, since hampering one of these giants could backfire by making it easier for another to expand. \u201cYou hate to cripple any one of them, and you hate to discourage them from attacking one another,\" said Scott Hemphill, a visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law.<br/><br/>If breaking up a tech giant is hard, another class of remedy would be to assert more control over a giant\u2019s behavior. This second category can also apply to Google, Facebook and Apple, but let\u2019s focus on what it might do to Amazon.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>The world has a love-hate relationship with Amazon. Consumers mainly love it, competitors hate it and the government is pulled in both directions. Almost 240 cities are vying to host the second U.S. headquarters of a company that many of them have condemned for putting local retailers out of business.<br/><br/>Amazon is a \u201ccheetelephant,\" said one analyst: an elephant that runs as fast as a cheetah. It\u2019s considerably faster than the regulators and lawmakers who have been caught flat-footed and are now wondering what, if anything, to do about its increasing market power, from books to groceries to moviemaking.<br/><br/>In a widely read article in the January issue of the Yale Law Journal entitled \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox</url> ,\" Yale\u2019s Khan laid out the two main options for dealing with Amazon and other companies that run on online platform markets, such as Google and Facebook. One is to discipline them via competition, relying on antitrust law to make sure they don\u2019t put competitors out of business. The other is to throw in the towel on competition and \u201caccept that they are inherently monopolistic or oligopolistic and regulate them instead.\" You\u2019d pursue the second option if you thought there were such important economies of scale that it made sense for Amazon to be huge, even dominant. In that case you\u2019d let it grow, Khan wrote, \u201cwhile neutering the firm\u2019s ability to exploit its dominance.\"<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>For those who want to rely on the competition solution, a key problem is coming up with a standard for judging when Amazon is competing unfairly. Let\u2019s say Amazon slashes prices. Is that a \u201cpredatory\" move designed to drive a competitor out of business and clear the way to raise prices and profits? Or is it just aggressive pricing by a company that has no intention of raising prices in the future?<br/><br/>\u201cIf you look at the business models of these firms, none of these is a predatory pricing model. These firms are making a lot of money doing what they\u2019re currently doing,\" said Penn\u2019s Hovenkamp. Besides, he said, \u201cthere are constantly new entrants\" that would prevent a company from earning monopolistic profits. For antitrust enforcers, the problem is that by the time you know for sure whether a company predatorily drove rivals out of business, it\u2019s too late to prevent it.<br/><br/>If the choice is to accept rather than fight Amazon\u2019s dominance, one traditional solution would be to regulate Amazon the same as the local electricity, gas, water or sewer utilities. That would involve treating it like a \u201ccommon carrier,\" meaning it would be barred from favoring its own products over those of competitors by, say, displaying them more prominently. <br/><br/>Short of that, Amazon\u2019s network could be declared an \u201cessential facility,\" meaning Amazon would have to let any competitor use its platform without question. Khan argues that Amazon\u2019s delivery service, its Marketplace and Amazon Web Services could all come to be considered essential facilities someday, \u201cin light of the company\u2019s current trajectory.\"<br/><br/>\u201cEssential\" is kind of a stretch, at least for now. Vendors don\u2019t have to use the Amazon Marketplace if they don\u2019t want to, and there are plenty of other choices for cloud providers.<br/><br/>Customers might not notice much change right away if Amazon\u2019s various platforms were declared essential facilities that are open to everyone. After all, other companies already account for half the items sold on Amazon Marketplace. But over time, the reliability of merchandise sold through Amazon might decline if the company had to accept all vendors, including crappy ones.<br/><br/>Another option, designating Amazon as a common carrier, would let regulators control what Amazon charges vendors for appearing on its site or using its delivery service. There again, the change might not be immediately apparent to customers, especially if regulators stepped in only to halt obviously unfair treatment.<br/><br/>So far we\u2019ve looked at a breakup solution for Google and a regulation solution for Amazon. The Google breakup seems far-fetched, and the result of our Amazon regulation scenario is underwhelming. What else? Another solution that\u2019s being floated is to hold companies liable for the things that happen on their platforms. Let\u2019s see how that would play out for Facebook.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>None other than British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of treating Facebook, Google and Twitter like news organizations, making them responsible for content appearing on their platforms. In the U.S. Senate, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) would expose internet companies such as Facebook and Google to civil lawsuits over content created by their customers. There\u2019s a similar bill in the House.<br/><br/>To turn Facebook into a publisher, Congress would have to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The section protects social networks from lawsuits over content created by others. There\u2019s also a Good Samaritan provision, which says that if the companies do choose to kill some offensive customer-created content, they don\u2019t thereby lose their legal protection and become responsible for every other bad thing customers do on their platforms.<br/><br/>Notice how making Facebook liable for customers\u2019 content is very different\u2014opposite, really\u2014from the solution of making it and others into common carriers. A common carrier, such as a plain vanilla phone company, submits to regulation of its prices and terms of service but has pretty much complete immunity against lawsuits over customers\u2019 behavior. No one holds the phone company responsible for things people say to each other on the phone.<br/><br/>It\u2019s clear that the government isn\u2019t willing to excuse Facebook for the content that has appeared on its site, from animal abuse to live-streamed suicides. The company has become far more aggressive about rooting out offensive material, including fake news, sex-trafficking and hate speech. By monitoring itself, it\u2019s hoping to dodge government control.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>But that\u2019s creating a whole new set of problems, including backlash from customers and activists, who say Facebook is setting itself up as an unofficial censor. Right-leaning groups accuse Facebook of a liberal bias. Facebook considers itself a marketplace of ideas and rails against the notion that it's a media company. Some critics are asserting a First Amendment right to free speech on Facebook, saying that it has become, in effect, a public space. They cite a 1946 Supreme Court decision, Marsh v. Alabama, that said a state trespassing statute couldn\u2019t prevent distribution of religious materials on the sidewalk, even in a privately owned company town.<br/><br/>\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build,\" Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote in October. \u201cWhen the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.\"<br/><br/>Facebook, in other words, is damned if it does censor and damned if it doesn\u2019t. How is this likely to evolve? One possibility is that Facebook will tire of taking the heat and voluntarily submit to government regulation. John Battelle, a tech writer and entrepreneur who helped launch Wired and the Industry Standard, has argued for just this approach.<br/><br/>A regulated Facebook would still have to employ people and algorithms to scour its website of forbidden materials, as it does today, but at least it could point the finger at lawmakers and regulators if questioned about its choices. The same would go for Google and some companies not covered here, such as Twitter.<br/><br/>But as troubling as censorship by Facebook is, censorship by the government could turn out worse: \u201cA lot of the people who say, \u2018Well, these tech giants ought to be regulated,\u2019 are also people who are quite critical of the current government. They haven\u2019t really thought through what it means to give more regulatory tools to a government they disapprove of,\" said Michael Godwin, a tech law veteran who is director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank.<br/><br/>That brings us to Apple, which differs from the others in that it\u2019s not mainly a platform company making money by bringing together friends and advertisers or suppliers and customers. Many of the issues that affect Google, Amazon and Facebook are less important for Apple. But one\u2014taxation\u2014is huge for Apple and important for all four companies.<br/><br/>Google: Breaking Up a Tech Giant Is Hard to Do<br/><br/>Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, finished its last fiscal year with $216 billion in cash and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As Congress looks under the seat cushions for spare change, Apple\u2019s foreign treasure is a tempting target\u2014especially since, in reality, the money is mostly held in the U.S. in dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds.<br/><br/>Right now Apple doesn\u2019t have to pay U.S. tax on profits earned abroad until it \u201crepatriates\" the money, by paying a dividend or benefiting shareholders in some other way. Tax bills under consideration call for changing that system, taxing the entire sum now, although at preferential rates\u20147 percent to 14 percent in the House plan and 5 percent to 10 percent in the Senate's. The economic rationale for the super-low rates is shaky. In principle, although it\u2019s highly unlikely, nothing is stopping Congress from charging companies the entire 35 percent they owe.<br/><br/>The Europeans are even more exercised than the Americans over how hard it is to tax Apple and the other tech giants. The European Commission claims that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed it to pay an effective tax rate in 2014 of just 0.005 percent on its European profits. In 2016, it ordered Ireland to collect as much as 13 billion euros in back taxes from Apple. Ireland, which uses a low tax rate to attract business, has balked. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission\u2019s order \u201ctotal political crap,\" saying his company had paid its fair share of taxes.<br/><br/>Until recently, tech companies have had lots of ways to minimize their taxes legally. The general idea has been to take advantage of transfer-pricing rules by deeming as much of your profits as possible to have been earned in a low-tax jurisdiction such as Ireland. But the Europeans are tightening those loopholes. Aside from the Apple case, Amazon this year was also ordered to pay 250 million euros in back taxes to Luxembourg.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a good bet that there will be more such orders in coming years. Governments want money, and the four tech giants have a lot of it. In the meantime, while trying to come up with a better tax system, Europe is toying with the idea of taxing the tech companies\u2019 revenue rather than their profits. The reasoning is that revenue is harder to manipulate. But revenue is a crude measure of a company\u2019s ability to pay taxes. Revenue-based taxation would be too hard on companies with lots of revenue but little profit, and too easy on companies with little revenue but lots of profit. \u201cI liken it to a drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there,\" said Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. \u201cThe mere fact that it\u2019s easier to measure revenue doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to tax.\"<br/><br/>What would be smarter would be changing the tax code to take away the incentive for companies to attribute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Some Europeans are discussing an idea of splitting a company\u2019s worldwide tax liability among countries, according to how much revenue the company derives in each country. Assets or employment in a country could also be used as yardsticks. This column from September explains the basic concept:<br/><br/>Under an apportionment system, each country is still permitted to set its corporate tax rate however it chooses. But it will be able to charge its rate only on its little slice of the company\u2019s global profit\u2014a slice that\u2019s determined by an agreed-upon formula. A country can no longer grab a bigger piece of a shrinking corporate-tax pie by cutting its rate below other countries\u2019. In one stroke, the race to the bottom in tax rates is cut short.<br/><br/>The European Commission raised the idea in 2011 and again in 2016 in the form of something called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. \"It's an amazing change. Ten years ago nobody talked about this,\" said Jose Antonio Ocampo, a Columbia University professor and former Colombian finance minister who is chairman of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.<br/><br/>Getting low-tax countries to go along with an apportionment system would be tough, though. No country wants to give up what makes it special. So something like the current tax system, albeit with fewer loopholes, is likely to persist for at least awhile. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon will keep finding ways to pit countries against one another.<br/><br/>As the four tech giants grow and invade each other\u2019s turf, it may turn out that the strongest force preventing them from abusing the public is the force of competition\u2014i.e., each other.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINITP-357192</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WINITP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2V-2M91-DY2V-D3HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337441</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Windows IT Pro Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 30, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

On 25 August 2010, the 16-year-old internet vlogger died after a four-year battle with thyroid cancer. In her early teens, Esther had gained a loyal following online, where she posted about her love of Harry Potter, and her illness. Then, on 18 February 2011 - six months after her death - Esther posted a message on her Twitter account, @crazycrayon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's currently Friday, January 14 of the year 2010. just wanted to say: I seriously hope that I'm alive when this posts,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">she wrote</url>, adding an emoji of a smiling face in sunglasses. Her mother, Lori Earl from Massachusetts, tells me Esther's online friends were \"freaked out\" by the tweet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'd say they found her tweet jarring because it was unexpected,\" she says. Earl doesn't know which service her daughter used to schedule the tweet a year in advance, but believes it was intended for herself, not for loved ones after her death. \"She hoped she would receive her own messages ... [it showed] her hopes and longings to still be living, to hold on to life.\"</p><p>Although Esther did not intend her tweet to be a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">posthumous message</url> for her family, a host of services now encourage people to plan their online afterlives. Want to post on social media and communicate with your friends after death? There are lots of apps for that!       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Replika</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Eternime</url> are artificially intelligent chatbots that can imitate your speech for loved ones after you die;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">GoneNotGone</url> enables you to send emails from the grave; and DeadSocial's \"goodbye tool\" allows you to \"tell your friends and family that you have died\". In       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">season two, episode one of Black Mirror</url>, a young woman recreates her dead boyfriend as an artificial intelligence - what was once the subject of a dystopian 44-minute fantasy is nearing reality.</p><p>But although Charlie Brooker portrayed the digital afterlife as something twisted, in reality online legacies can be comforting for the bereaved. Esther Earl used a service called FutureMe to send emails to herself, stating that her parents should read them if she died. Three months after Esther's death, her mother received one of these emails. \"They were seismically powerful,\" she says. \"That letter made us weep, but also brought us great comfort - I think because of its intentionality, the fact that she was thinking about her future, the clarity with which she accepted who she was and who she hoped to become.\"</p><p>Because of the power of Esther's messages, Earl knows that if she were dying, she would also schedule emails for her husband and children. \"I think I would be very clear about how many messages I had written and when to expect them,\" she adds, noting they could cause anxiety for relatives and friends otherwise.</p><p>Yet while the terminally ill ponder their digital legacies, the majority of us do not. In November 2018, a YouGov survey found that only <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">7% of people want their social media accounts to remain online after they die</url>, yet it is estimated that by 2100, there could be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">4.9bn dead users on Facebook</url> alone. Planning your digital death is not really about scheduling status updates for loved ones or building an AI avatar. In practice, it is a series of unglamorous decisions about deleting your Facebook, Twitter and Netflix accounts; protecting your email against hackers; bestowing your music library to your friends; allowing your family to download photos from your cloud; and ensuring that your online secrets remain hidden in their digital alcoves.</p><p>\"We should think really carefully about anything we're entrusting or storing on any digital platform,\" says Dr <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Elaine Kasket</url>, a psychologist and author of All the Ghosts in the Machine: Illusions of Immortality in the Digital Age. \"If our digital stuff were like our material stuff, we would all look like extreme hoarders.\" Kasket says it is naive to assume that our online lives die with us. In practice, your hoard of digital data can cause endless complications for loved ones, particularly when they don't have access to your passwords.</p><p>\"I cursed my father every step of the way,\" says Richard, a 34-year-old engineer from Ontario who was made executor of his father's estate four years ago. Although Richard's father left him a list of passwords, not one remained valid by the time of his death. Richard couldn't access his father's online government accounts, his email (to inform his contacts about the funeral), or even log on to his computer. For privacy reasons, Microsoft refused to help Richard access his father's computer. \"Because of that experience I will never call Microsoft again,\" he says.</p><p>Our devices capture so much stuff, we don't think about the consequences for when we're not here</p><p>Compare this with the experience of Jan-Ole Lincke, a 24-year-old pharmaceutical worker from Hamburg whose father left up-to-date passwords behind on a sheet of paper when he died two years ago. \"Getting access was thankfully very easy,\" says Lincke, who was able to download pictures from his father's Google profile, shut down his email to prevent hacking, and delete credit card details from his Amazon account. \"It definitely made me think about my own [digital legacy],\" says Lincke, who has now written his passwords down.</p><p>Yet despite growing awareness about the data we leave behind, very few of us are doing anything about it. In 2013, a Brighton-based company called <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Cirrus Legacy</url> made headlines after it began allowing people to securely leave behind passwords for a nominated loved one. Yet the Cirrus website is now defunct, and the Guardian was unable to reach its founder for comment. Clarkson Wright &amp; Jakes Solicitors, a Kent-based law firm that offered the Cirrus service to its clients, says the option was never popular.</p><p>\"We've been aware for quite a period now that the big issue for the next generation is digital footprints,\" says Jeremy Wilson, head of the wills and estates team at CWJ. \"Cirrus made sense and ticked a lot of boxes but, to be honest, not one client has taken us up on it.\"</p><p>Wilson also notes that people don't know about the laws surrounding digital assets such as the music, movies and games they have downloaded. While many of us assume we own our iTunes library or collection of PlayStation games, in fact, most digital downloads are only licensed to us, and this licence ends when we die. </p><p>What we want to do and what the law allows us to do with our digital legacy can therefore be very different things. Yet at present it is not the law that dominates our decisions about digital death. \"Regulation is always really slow to keep up with technology,\" says Kasket. \"That means that platforms and corporations like Facebook end up writing the rules.\"</p><p>In 2012, a 15-year-old German girl died after being hit by a subway train in Berlin. Although the girl had <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">given her parents her online passwords</url>, they were unable to access her Facebook account because it had been \"memorialised\" by the social network. Since October 2009, Facebook has allowed profiles to be transformed into \"memorial pages\" that exist in perpetuity. No one can then log into the account or update it, and it remains frozen as a place for loved ones to share their grief.</p><p>The girl's parents sued Facebook for access to her account - they hoped to use it to determine whether her death was suicide. They originally lost the case, although a German court later granted the parents permission to get into her account, six years after her death.</p><p>\"I find it concerning that any big tech company that hasn't really shown itself to be the most honest, transparent or ethical organisation is writing the rulebook for how we should grieve, and making moral judgments about who should or shouldn't have access to sensitive personal data,\" says Kasket. The author is concerned with how Facebook uses the data of the dead for profit, arguing that living users keep their Facebook accounts because they don't want to be \"locked out of the cemetery\" and lose access to relatives' memorialised pages. As a psychologist, she is also concerned that Facebook is dictating our grief.</p><p>\"Facebook created memorial profiles to prevent what they called 'pain points', like getting birthday reminders for a deceased person,\" she says. \"But one of the mothers I spoke to for my book was upset when her daughter's profile was memorialised and she stopped getting these reminders. She was like, 'This is my daughter, I gave birth to her, it's still her birthday'.\"</p><p>While Facebook users now have the option to appoint a \"legacy contact\" who can manage or delete their profile after death, Kasket is concerned that there are very few personalisation options when it comes to things like birthday reminders, or whether strangers can post on your wall. \"The individuality and the idiosyncrasy of grief will flummox Facebook every time in its attempts to find a one-size-fits-all solution,\" she says.</p><p>Matthew Helm, a 27-year-old technical analyst from Minnesota, says his mother's Facebook profile compounded his grief after she died four years ago. \"The first year was the most difficult,\" says Helm, who felt some relatives posted about their grief on his mother's wall in order to get attention. \"In the beginning I definitely wished I could just wipe it all.\" Helm hoped to delete the profile but was unable to access his mother's account. He did not ask the tech giant to delete the profile because he didn't want to give it his mother's death certificate.</p><p>Conversely, Stephanie Nimmo, a 50-year-old writer from Wimbledon, embraced the chance to become her husband's legacy contact after he died of bowel cancer in December 2015. \"My husband and I shared a lot of information on Facebook. It almost became a bit of an online diary,\" she says. \"I didn't want to lose that.\" She is pleased people continue to post on her husband's wall, and enjoys tagging him in posts about their children's achievements. \"I'm not being maudlin or creating a shrine, just acknowledging that their dad lived and he played a role in their lives,\" she explains.</p><p>Nimmo is now passionate about encouraging people to plan their digital legacies. Her husband also left her passwords for his Reddit, Twitter, Google and online banking accounts. He also deleted Facebook messages he didn't want his wife to see. \"Even in a marriage there are certain things you wouldn't want your other half to see because it's private,\" says Nimmo. \"It worries me a little that if something happened to me, there are things I wouldn't want my kids to see.\"</p><p>When it comes to the choice between allowing relatives access to your accounts or letting a social media corporation use your data indefinitely after your death, privacy is a fundamental issue. Although the former makes us sweat, the latter is arguably more dystopian. <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Dr Edina Harbinja</url> is a law lecturer at Aston University, who argues that we should all legally be entitled to postmortem privacy.</p><p>If we don't start making decisions about our digital deaths, then someone else will be making them for us</p><p>\"The deceased should have the right to control what happens to their personal data and online identities when they die,\" she says, explaining that the Data Protection Act 2018 defines \"personal data\" as relating only to living people. Harbinja says this is problematic because rules such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation don't apply to the dead, and because there are no provisions that allow us to pass on our online data in wills. \"There can be many issues because we don't know what would happen if someone is a legacy contact on Facebook, but the next of kin want access.\" For example, if you decide you want your friend to delete your Facebook pictures after you die, your husband could legally challenge this. \"There could be potential court cases.\"</p><p>Kasket says people \"don't realise how much preparation they need to do in order to make plans that are actually able to be carried out\". It is clear that if we don't start making decisions about our digital deaths, then someone else will be making them for us. \"What one person craves is what another person is horrified about,\" says Kasket.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">How close are we to a Black Mirror-style digital afterlife?</url></p><p>Esther Earl continued to tweet for another year after her death. Automated posts from the music website Last.fm updated her followers about the music she enjoyed. There is no way to predict the problems we will leave online when we die; Lori Earl would never have thought of revoking Last.fm's permissions to post on her daughter's page before she died. \"We would have turned off the posts if we had been able to,\" she says.</p><p>Kasket says \"the fundamental message\" is to think about how much you store digitally. \"Our devices, without us even having to try, capture so much stuff,\" she says. \"We don't think about the consequences for when we're not here any more.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\">Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53315744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-DXN1-F021-64KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2152\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Families trying to hold onto or find out more about a loved one are often prevented from doing so by company policies that automatically terminate accounts belonging to the deceased, a situation that's complicated even further when those accounts contain important information. The issue, which is the subject of legislation in a number of states, is also sensitive when it becomes the focus of so much raw emotion.<br/> 'This is something most people don't think of until they are faced with it,' Karen Williams, an Oregon mother who lost her son Loren in a 2005 motorcycle accident, told the Associated Press[1]. 'They have no idea what will be lost.'<br/> The average Web user has 25 accounts, according to a 2007 Microsoft study[2], although that figure has almost certainly increased as Americans have further entrenched themselves online in the seven years since. Users don't realize it, but many of the conversations and photos they share on social networks don't even belong to them, but to Facebook(NASDAQ:FB), Google(NASDAQ:GOOG) and the like. And each company has a different policy when a user passes away.<br/>Facebook, for instance, permits families to convert a dead user's profile into a memorial page. Although the account remains locked, users can share their memories of the deceased by posting photos, comments and links. Otherwise the company will remove the account after receiving a special request from an immediate family member.<br/>Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) deactivates an account when asked to by an estate executor or an immediate family member. Googlelaunched a feature last year called the Inactive Account Manager[3], which lets users to tell Googlewhat they want to be done with their digital assets when they die.<br/> The Uniform Law Commission, an influential group of lawyers, has lobbied Congress to enact a law that gives families access to everything online unless the deceased specifically mentions otherwise in a will.<br/> 'Our email accounts are our filing cabinets these days,' Suzanne Brown Walsh, one of the attorneys who led the effort, told the AP, stipulating that 'if you need access to an email account, in most states you wouldn't get it.'<br/>Virginia, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Indiana, Idaho and Nevada all have laws regulating access to inactive profiles. The laws vary wildly, though, with Virginia being the only state that addresses how a minor's account is treated. Connecticut and Rhode Island, on the other hand, only have laws applying to email.<br/> Privacy watchdogs have been reluctant to accept such plans, noting that the users in question never gave explicit permission for their most personal files to be analyzed.<br/> 'The digital world is a different world,' Ginger McCall, an associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, told the AP. 'No one would keep 10 years of every communication they ever had with dozens or even hundreds of other people under their bed.'<br/> Relatives are known to find their loved ones' passwords and log onto their accounts that way, although that simple action is in fact illegal in many jurisdictions.<br/> Jim Lamm, a Minnesota estate lawyer who focuses on digital issues, told the Wall Street Journal[4], 'There hasn't been a lot of case law on this. It's up to a prosecuting attorney whether to charge' someone for looking at the accounts of the dead, he went on, 'and that's not a risk that I would advise them to take.'<br/> If the Uniform Law Commission is successful in pushing their version of the law, it would streamline the laws throughout the U.S. and set a new standard for families, including Karen Williams, the mother from Oregon.<br/> 'I could understand where some people don't want to share everything,' she told the AP. 'But to us, losing (our son) unexpectedly, anything he touched became so valuable to us.' And 'if we were in the era of keeping a shoebox full of letters, that would have been part of the estate and we wouldn't have thought anything of it.'<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/74164/www2007.pdf\">https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/74164/www2007.pdf</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/74164/www2007.pdf\">https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/74164/www2007.pdf</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2013/04/plan-your-digital-afterlife-with.html\">http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2013/04/plan-your-digital-afterlife-with.html</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324677204578188220364231346\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324677204578188220364231346</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX10876714056404471691611500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CP7-64C1-JCMN-Y0JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>11:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 17, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is also the first of multiple posts that will discuss the numerous ways in which Big Tech is helping the world to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.]Republican Senator Josh Hawley infamously argued[2] that Big Tech is overrated. In his words:My biggest critique of big tech is: what big innovation have they really given us? What is it now that in the last 15, 20 years that people who say they are the brightest minds in the country have given this country?</p><p> What are their great innovations?To Senator Hawley these questions seemed rhetorical. Big Tech's innovations were trivial gadgets: 'autoplay' and 'snap streaks', to quote him once more.But, as any Monty Python connoisseur will tell you, rhetorical questions have a way of being not so rhetorical. In one of Python's most famous jokes, members of the 'People's Front of Judea' ask 'what have the Romans ever done for us'? To their own surprise, the answer turns out to be a great deal:This post is the first in a series examining some of the many ways in which Big Tech is making Coronavirus-related lockdowns and social distancing more bearable, and how Big Tech is enabling our economies to continue functioning (albeit at a severely reduced pace) throughout the outbreak.Although Big Tech's contributions are just a small part of a much wider battle, they suggest that the world is drastically better situated to deal with COVID-19 than it would have been twenty years ago - and this is in no small part thanks to Big Tech's numerous innovations.Of course, some will say that the world would be even better equipped to handle COVID-19, if Big Tech had only been subject to more (or less) regulation. Whether these critiques are correct, or not, they are not the point of this post. For many, like Senator Hawley, it is apparently undeniable that tech does more harm than good. But, as this post suggests, that is surely not the case. And before we do decide whether and how we want to regulate it in the future, we should be particularly mindful of what aspects of 'Big Tech' seem particularly suited to dealing with the current crisis, and ensure that we don't adopt regulations that thoughtlessly undermine these. 1. Priceless information One of the most important ways in which Big Tech firms have supported international attempts to COVID-19 has been their role as information intermediaries.As the title of a New York Times article[3] put it:When Facebook Is More Trustworthy Than the President: Social media companies are delivering reliable information in the coronavirus crisis. Why can't they do that all the time?The author is at least correct on the first part. Big Tech has become a cornucopia of reliable information about the virus: Big Tech firms are partnering[4] with the White House and other agencies to analyze massive COVID-19 datasets in order to help discover novel answers to questions about transmission, medical care, and other interventions. This partnership is possible thanks to the massive investments in AI infrastructure that the leading tech firms have made.Google Scholar[5] has partnered with renowned medical journals (as well as public authorities) to guide citizens towards cutting edge scholarship relating to COVID-19. This a transformative ressource in a world of lockdows and overburdened healthcare providers.Google has added a number of features[6] to its main search engine - such as a 'Coronavirus Knowledge Panel' and SOS alerts - in order to help users deal with the spread of the virus.On Twitter, information and insights about COVID-19 compete in the market for ideas. Numerous news outlets have published lists of recommended people to follow (Fortune[7], Forbes[8]).Furthermore - to curb some of the unwanted effects of an unrestrained market for ideas - Twitter (and most other digital platforms) links to the websites of public authorities when users search for COVID-related hashtags.This flow of information is a two-way street: Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, among others, enable citizens and experts to weigh in on the right policy approach to COVID-19.Though the results are sometimes far from perfect, these exchanges may prove invaluable in critical times where usual methods of policy-making (such as hearings and conferences) are mostly off the table.Perhaps most importantly, the Internet is a precious source of knowledge about how to deal with an emerging virus, as well as life under lockdown. We often take for granted how much of our lives benefit from extreme specialization. These exchanges are severely restricted under lockdown conditions. Luckily, with the internet and modern search engines (pioneered by Google), most of the world's information is but a click away. For example, Facebook Groups have been employed[9] by users of the social media platform in order to better coordinate necessary activity among community members \u2014like giving blood \u2014 while still engaging in social distancing. In short, search engines and social networks have been beacons of information regarding COVID-19. Their mostly bottom-up[10] approach to knowledge generation (i.e. popular topics emerge organically) is essential in a world of extreme uncertainty. This has ultimately enabled these players to stay ahead of the curve in bringing valuable information to citizens around the world. 2. Social interactions This is probably the most obvious way in which Big Tech is making life under lockdown more bearable for everyone. In Italy[11], Whatsapp messages and calls jumped by 20% following the outbreak of COVID-19. And Microsoft claims that the use of Skype jumped by 100%.Younger users[12] are turning to social networks, like TikTok[13], to deal with the harsh realities of the pandemic.Strangers are using Facebook groups[14] to support each other through difficult times.And institutions, like the WHO[15], are piggybacking on this popularity to further raise awareness about COVID-19 via social media.In South Africa[16], health authorities even created a whatsapp contact to answer users questions about the virus.Most importantly, social media is a godsend for senior citizens and anyone else who may have to live in almost total isolation for the foreseeable future. For instance, nursing homes are putting communications apps, like Skype and WhatsApp, in the hands of their patients, to keep up their morale (here[17] and here[18]). And with the economic effects of COVID-19 starting to gather speed, users will more than ever be grateful to receive these services free of charge. Sharing data - often very limited amounts[19] - with a platform is an insignificant price to pay in times of economic hardship. 3. Working &amp; Learning It will also be impossible to effectively fight COVID-19 if we cannot maintain the economy afloat. Stock markets have already plunged[20] by record amounts. Surely, these losses would be unfathomably worse if many of us were not lucky enough to be able to work, and from the safety of our own homes. And for those individuals who are unable to work from home, their own exposure is dramatically reduced thanks to a significant proportion of the population that can stay out of public.Once again, we largely have Big Tech to thank for this. Downloads of Microsoft Teams and Zoom are surging on both Google[21] and Apple's app stores. This is hardly surprising. With much of the workforce staying at home, these video-conference applications have become essential. The increased load generated by people working online might even have caused Microsoft Teams to crash[22] in Europe.According to Microsoft, the number of Microsoft Teams meetings increased by 500 percent[23] in China.Sensing that the current crisis may last for a while, some firms have also started to conduct job interviews online[24]; populars apps for doing so include Skype, Zoom and Whatsapp.Slack has also seen a surge in usage[25], as firms set themselves up to work remotely. It has started offering free training[26], to help firms move online.Along similar lines, Google recently announced that its G suite of office applications - which enables users to share and work on documents online - had recently passed 2 Billion users[27].Some tech firms (including Google, Microsoft and Zoom) have gone a step further and started giving away[28] some of their enterprise productivity software, in order to help businesses move their workflows online. And Big Tech is also helping universities, schools and parents to continue providing coursework and lectures to their students/children. Zoom and Microsoft Teams[29] have been popular choices for online learning. To facilitate the transition to online learning, Zoom has notably lifted time limits[30] relating to the free version of its app (for schools in the most affected areas).Even in the US, where the virus outbreak is currently smaller than in Europe, thousands[31] of students are already being taught online.Much of the online learning being conducted for primary school children is being done[32] with affordable Chromebooks. And some of these Chromebooks are distributed to underserved schools through grant programs[33] administered by Google.Moreover, at the time of writing, most of the best selling books on Amazon.com[34] are pre-school learning books: Finally, the advent of online storage services, such as Dropbox[35] and Google Drive[36], has largely alleviated the need for physical copies of files. In turn, this enables employees to remotely access all the files they need to stay productive. While this may be convenient under normal circumstances, it becomes critical when retrieving a binder in the office is no longer an option. 4. So what has Big Tech ever done for us? With millions of families around the world currently under forced lockdown, it is becoming increasingly evident that Big Tech's innovations are anything but trivial. Innovations that seemed like convenient tools only a couple of days ago, are now becoming essential parts of our daily lives (or, at least, we are finally realizing how powerful they truly are).The fight against COVID-19 will be hard. We can at least be thankful that we have Big Tech by our side. Paraphrasing the Monty Python crew:Q: What has Big Tech ever done for us?A: Abundant, free, and easily accessible information. Precious social interactions. Online working and learning.Q: But apart from information, social interactions, and online working (and learning); what has Big Tech ever done for us?For the answer to this question, I invite you to stay tuned for the next post in this series. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;title=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20IThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Ihttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F17%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-imagine-if-covid-19-had-occurred-20-years-ago%2F&amp;title=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20IThe</url> post What Has Big Tech Ever Done for Us?

The entire series of posts is available here[1].This post is authored by Dirk Aue[2]r[3], (Senior Researcher, Liege Competition &amp; Innovation Institute; Senior Fellow, ICLE).]Across the globe, millions of people are rapidly coming to terms with the harsh realities of life under lockdown. As governments impose ever-greater social distancing measures, many of the daily comforts we took for granted are no longer available to us.And yet, we can all take solace in the knowledge that our current predicament would have been far less tolerable if the COVID-19 outbreak had hit us twenty years ago. Among others, we have Big Tech firms to thank for this silver lining.Contrary to the claims of critics, such as Senator Josh Hawley, Big Tech has produced game-changing innovations that dramatically improve our ability to fight COVID-19.The previous post[4] in this series showed that innovations produced by Big Tech provide us with critical information, allow us to maintain some level of social interactions (despite living under lockdown), and have enabled companies, universities and schools to continue functioning (albeit at a severely reduced pace).But apart from information, social interactions, and online working (and learning); what has Big Tech ever done for us?</p><p>One of the most underappreciated ways in which technology (mostly pioneered by Big Tech firms) is helping the world deal with COVID-19 has been a rapid shift towards contactless economic transactions. Not only are consumers turning towards digital goods to fill their spare time, but physical goods (most notably food) are increasingly being exchanged without any direct contact.These ongoing changes would be impossible without the innovations and infrastructure that have emerged from tech and telecommunications companies over the last couple of decades.Of course, the overall picture is still bleak. The shift to contactless transactions has only slightly softened the tremendous blow suffered by the retail and restaurant industries - some predictions suggest their overall revenue could fall by at least 50% in the second quarter of 2020[5]. Nevertheless, as explained below, this situation would likely be significantly worse without the many innovations produced by Big Tech companies. For that we would be thankful. 1. Food and other goods For a start, the COVID-19 outbreak (and government measures to combat it) has caused many brick &amp; mortar stores and restaurants to shut down. These closures would have been far harder to implement before the advent of online retail and food delivery platforms.At the time of writing, e-commerce websites already appear to have witnessed a 20-30% increase in sales (other sources report 52% increase[6], compared to the same time last year). This increase will likely continue in the coming months.The Amazon Retail platform has been at the forefront of this online shift. Having witnessed a surge in online shopping, Amazon announced that it would be hiring 100.000 distribution workers[7] to cope with the increased demand. Amazon's staff have also been asked to work overtime[8] in order to meet increased demand (in exchange, Amazon has doubled their[9] pay for overtime hours).To attract these new hires and ensure that existing ones continue working, Amazon simultaneously announced that it would be increasing wages[10] in virus-hit countries (from $15 to $17, in the US) .Amazon also stopped accepting[11] 'non-essential' goods in its warehouses, in order to prioritize the sale of household essentials and medical goods that are in high demand.Finally, in Italy, Amazon decided not to stop its operations, despite some employees testing positive for COVID-19[12]. Controversial as this move may be, Amazon's private interests are aligned with those of society - maintaining the supply of essential goods is now more important than ever. And it is not just Amazon that is seeking to fill the breach left temporarily by brick &amp; mortar retail. Other retailers are also stepping up efforts to distribute their goods online. The apps of traditional retail chains have witnessed record daily downloads[13] (thus relying on the smartphone platforms pioneered by Google and Apple).Walmart[14] has become the go-to choice for online food purchases: (Source: Bloomberg[15]) The retailer also announced that it would cut store hours[16] - likely hoping that its consumers will shift their purchases online. Walmart also plans to hire 150.000 workers in its warehouses and pay out bonuses[17] to its employees, in order to meet increased demand.Instacart announced that it was seeking to hire an additional 300.000 workers[18] to meet increased demand.Given the drastically lower activity within their brick &amp; mortar stores, Walmart and Target, among others, have announced they would make their parking lots available for drive-thru testing[19].And many other retailers[20] have decided to close their stores and switch towards online purchasing[21]. The shift to online shopping mimics what occurred in China, during its own COVID-19 lockdown. According to an article published in HBR, e-commerce penetration reached 36.6% of retail sales in China[22] (compared to 29.7% in 2019[23]). The same article explains how Alibaba's technology is enabling traditional retailers to better manage their supply chains, ultimately helping them to sell their goods online.A study by Nielsen ratings found that 67% of retailers[24] would expand online channels.One large retailer shut many of its physical stores and redeployed many of its employees to serve as online influencers on WeChat[25], thus attempting to boost online sales.Spurred by compassion and/or a desire to boost its brand abroad, Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have made large efforts to provide critical medical supplies (notably tests kits and surgical masks) to COVID-hit countries such as the US[26] and Belgium[27]. And it is not just retail that is adapting to the outbreak. Many restaurants are trying to stay afloat by shifting from in-house dining to deliveries. These attempts have been made possible by the emergence of food delivery platforms, such as UberEats and Deliveroo.These platforms have taken several steps to facilitate food deliveries during the outbreak. UberEats announced that it would be waiving delivery fees[28] for independent restaurants.Both UberEats and Deliveroo[29] have put in place systems for deliveries to take place without direct physical contact. While not entirely risk-free, meal delivery can provide welcome relief to people experiencing stressful lockdown conditions. Similarly, the shares of Blue Apron[30] - an online meal-kit delivery service - have surged more than 600% since the start of the outbreak.In short, COVID-19 has caused a drastic shift towards contactless retail and food delivery services. It is an open question how much of this shift would have been possible without the pioneering business model innovations brought about by Amazon and its online retail platform, as well as modern food delivery platforms, such as UberEats and Deliveroo. At the very least, it seems unlikely that it would have happened as fast.The entertainment industry is another area where increasing digitization has made lockdowns more bearable. The reason is obvious: locked-down consumers still require some form of amusement. With physical supply chains under tremendous strain, and social gatherings no longer an option, digital media has thus become the default choice for many.Data published by Verizon[31] shows a sharp increase (in the week running from March 9 to March 16) in the consumption of digital entertainment, especially gaming:This echoes other sources, which also report that the use of traditional streaming platforms has surged in areas hit by COVID-19. Netflix subscriptions are said to be spiking in locked-down communities. During the first week of March, Netflix installations increased by 77% in Italy and 33% in Spain[32], compared to the February average. Netflix app downloads increased by 33%[33] in Hong kong and South Korea. The Amazon Prime[34] app saw a similar increase.YouTube[35] has also witnessed a surge in usage.Live streaming[36] (on platforms such as Periscope, Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc) has also increased in popularity. It is notably being used for everything from concerts[37] and comedy clubs[38] to religious services[39], and even zoo visits[40].Disney Plus has also been highly popular. According to one source, half of US homes with children under the age of 10 purchased a Disney Plus[41] subscription. This trend is expected to continue during the COVID-19 outbreak. Disney even released Frozen II[42] three months ahead of schedule in order to boost new subscriptions.Hollywood studios[43] have started releasing some of their lower-profile titles directly on streaming services. Traffic has also increased significantly on popular gaming platforms. According to the CEO of Verizon, gaming hours have gone up 75%[44] since the start of COVID-19 lockdows, in early March.Steam, one of the most popular gaming platforms, reached a record 20M concurrent users[45] on March 15.Fortnite is also experiencing increased usage. In Italy, of example, game time is said to have increased by 70%[46] since the beginning of the outbreak.EA's Call of Duty: Warzone achieved a record 15 million downloads[47] in the first three days following its release. Its release likely led to the biggest peak in network usage[48], in the UK, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak.And Tencent declared that the company's gaming arm would help it to weather the coronavirus storm[49].Live-streaming of video games[50] - on platforms such as Twitch - has also increased significantly. These are just a tiny sample of the many ways in which digital entertainment is filling the void left by social gatherings. It is thus central to the lives of people under lockdown. 2. Cashless payments But all of the services that are listed above rely on cashless payments - be it to limit the risk or contagion or because these transactions take place remotely. Fintech innovations have thus turned out to be one of the foundations that make social distancing policies viable.This is particularly evident in the food industry. Food delivery platforms, like UberEats and Deliveroo, already relied on mobile payments.Costa coffee[51] (a UK equivalent to starbucks) went cashless in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19.Domino's Pizza[52], among other franchises, announced that it would move to contactless deliveries.President Donald Trump is said to have discussed plans to keep drive-thru restaurants[53] open during the outbreak. This would also certainly imply exclusively digital payments.And although doubts[54] remain concerning the extent to which the SARS-CoV-2 virus may, or may not, be transmitted via banknotes and coins, many other businesses have preemptively ceased to accept cash payments[55]. As the Jodie Kelley - the CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association - put it, in a CNBC interview[56]:Contactless payments have come up as a new option for consumers who are much more conscious of what they touch.This increased demand for cashless payments has been a blessing for Fintech firms. Though it is too early to gage the magnitude of this shift, early signs - notably from China[57] - suggest that mobile payments have become more common during the outbreak.In China, Alipay[58] announced that it expected to radically expand its services to new sectors - restaurants, cinema bookings, real estate purchases - in an attempt to compete with WeChat.PayPal[59] has also witnessed an uptick in transactions, though this growth might ultimately be weighed-down by declining economic activity.In the past, Facebook had revealed plans[60] to offer mobile payments across its platforms - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram &amp; Libra. Those plans may not have been politically viable at the time. The COVID-19 could conceivably change this. In short, the COVID-19 outbreak has increased our reliance on digital payments, as these can both take place remotely and, potentially, limit contamination via banknotes. None of this would have been possible twenty years ago when industry pioneers, such as PayPal, were in their infancy. 3. High speed internet access Similarly, it goes without saying that none of the above would be possible without the tremendous investments that have been made in broadband infrastructure, most notably by internet service providers. Though these companies have often faced strong criticism[61] from the public, they provide the backbone upon which outbreak-stricken economies can function.By causing so many activities to move online, the COVID-19 outbreak has put broadband networks to the test. So for, broadband infrastructure around the world has been up to the task. This is partly because the spike in usage has occurred in daytime hours (where network's capacity is less straine), but also because ISPs traditionally rely on a number of tools to limit peak-time usage.The biggest increases in usage seem to have occurred in daytime hours. As data from OpenVault illustrates[62]:According to BT, one of the UK's largest telecoms operators, daytime internet usage is up by 50%[63], but peaks are still well within record levels (and other UK operators have made similar claims[64]):Anecdotal data also suggests that, so far, fixed internet providers have not significantly struggled to handle this increased traffic (the same goes for Content Delivery Networks[65]). Not only were these networks already designed to withstand high peaks in demand, but ISPs have, such as Verizon[66], increased their capacity to avoid potential issues.For instance, internet speed tests performed using Ookla[67] suggest that average download speeds only marginally decreased, it at all, in locked-down regions, compared to previous levels:However, the same data[68] suggests that mobile networks have faced slightly larger decreases in performance, though these do not appear to be severe. For instance, contrary to contemporaneous reports[69], a mobile network outage that occurred in the UK is unlikely[70] to have been caused by a COVID-related surge.The robustness exhibited by broadband networks is notably due to long-running efforts by ISPs (spurred by competition) to improve download speeds and latency. As one article[71] put it:For now, cable operators' and telco providers' networks are seemingly withstanding the increased demands, which is largely due to the upgrades that they've done over the past 10 or so years using technologies such as DOCSIS 3.1 or PON.Pushed in part by Google Fiber's launch back in 2012, the large cable operators and telcos, such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter Communications, have spent years upgrading their networks to 1-Gig speeds. Prior to those upgrades, cable operators in particular struggled with faster upload speeds, and the slowdown of broadband services during peak usage times, such as after school and in the evenings, as neighborhood nodes became overwhelmed.This is not without policy ramifications.For a start, these developments might vindicate antitrust enforcers that allowed mergers that led to higher investments, sometimes at the expense of slight reductions in price competition. This is notably the case for so-called 4 to 3 mergers in the wireless telecommunications industry. As an in-depth literature review by ICLE scholars[72] concludes:Studies of investment also found that markets with three facilities-based operators had significantly higher levels of investment by individual firms.Similarly, the COVID-19 outbreak has also cast further doubts over the appropriateness of net neutrality regulations[73]. Indeed, an important criticism of such regulations is that they prevent ISPs from using the price mechanism to manage congestion[74].It is these fears of congestion, likely unfounded (see above), that led the European Union to urge streaming companies to voluntarily reduce the quality of their products[75]. To date, Netflix[76], Youtube[77], Amazon Prime[78], Apple[79], Facebook[80] and Disney[81] have complied with the EU's request.This may seem like a trivial problem, but it was totally avoidable. As a result of net neutrality regulation[82], European authorities and content providers have been forced into an awkward position (likely unfounded[83]) that unnecessarily penalizes those consumers and ISPs who do not face congestion issues (conversely, it lets failing ISPs off the hook and disincentivizes further investments on their part). This is all the more unfortunate that, as argued above, streaming services are essential to locked-down consumers.Critics may retort that small quality decreases hardly have any impact on consumers. But, if this is indeed the case, then content providers were using up unnecessary amounts of bandwidth before the COVID-19 outbreak (something that is less likely to occur without net neutrality obligations). And if not, then European consumers have indeed been deprived of something they valued. The shoe is thus on the other foot.These normative considerations aside, the big point is that we can all be thankful to live in an era of high-speed internet. 4. Concluding remarks Big Tech is rapidly emerging as one of the heroes of the COVID-19 crisis. Companies that were once on the receiving end of daily reproaches - by the press, enforcers, and scholars alike - are gaining renewed appreciation from the public. Times have changed since the early days of these companies - where consumers marvelled at the endless possibilities that their technologies offered. Today we are coming to realize how essential tech companies have become to our daily lives, and how they make society more resilient in the face of fat-tailed events, like pandemics.The move to a contactless, digital, economy is a critical part of what makes contemporary societies better-equipped to deal with COVID-19. As this post has argued, online delivery, digital entertainment, contactless payments and high speed internet all play a critical role.To think that we receive some of these services for freeLast year, Erik Brynjolfsson, Avinash Collins and Felix Eggers published a paper in PNAS, showing that consumers were willing to pay significant sums[84] for online goods they currently receive free of charge. One can only imagine how much larger those sums would be if that same experiment were repeated today.Even Big Tech's critics are willing to recognize the huge debt we owe to these companies. As Stephen Levy wrote, in an article titled 'Has the Coronavirus Killed the Techlash?[85]':Who knew the techlash was susceptible to a virus?The pandemic does not make any of the complaints about the tech giants less valid. They are still drivers of surveillance capitalism who duck their fair share of taxes and abuse their power in the marketplace. We in the press must still cover them aggressively and skeptically. And we still need a reckoning that protects the privacy of citizens, levels the competitive playing field, and holds these giants to account. But the momentum for that reckoning doesn't seem sustainable at a moment when, to prop up our diminished lives, we are desperately dependent on what they've built. And glad that they built it.While it is still early to draw policy lessons from the outbreak, one thing seems clear: the COVID-19 pandemic provides yet further evidence that tech policymakers should be extremely careful not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, by promoting regulations that may thwart innovation (or the opposite). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;title=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20TwoThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;linkname=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20Twohttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F25%2Fwhat-has-big-tech-ever-done-for-us-part-two%2F&amp;title=What%20Has%20Big%20Tech%20Ever%20Done%20for%20Us%3F%20Part%20TwoThe</url> post What Has Big Tech Ever Done for Us?

Photo - Reuters file for illustrative purpose</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Google's fiercest critics use its technologies to research their fiery tirades against it or, more mundanely, to find their way around a foreign city. Let's be honest: life without Google would be awfully more tedious in a variety of important ways.<br/><br/>But that is not a good reason to leave Google and the other tech giants alone. On the contrary, the nature and importance of their contribution make it imperative that they be placed under democratic control \u2013 and not just because of the well appreciated need to protect individual privacy.<br/><br/>In recent years, Big Tech companies have been subjected to scrutiny for perfecting a dark art pioneered by commercial newspapers, radio, and television: attracting and holding our attention, in order to sell access to our senses to paying advertisers.<br/><br/>Whereas readers, listeners, and viewers were customers paying for some commodity, commercial electronic media learned how to profit by transacting directly with vendors while reducing us, and our data, to a passive commodity at the heart of the transaction.</p><p><br/><br/>Google, Facebook, and others were able to take this odd production process, where our attention is the traded commodity, to a different level, thanks to their stupendous capacity to personalize our screens. <br/><br/>Unlike their forebears, they can capture the attention of each one of us with person-specific (or even mood-specific) attractors, before selling to the highest bidder access both to our data and to our senses. <br/><br/>Underlying the backlash against Big Tech has been the sense that we are all becoming proletarianized users. In the 1970s and 1980s, we were annoyed when commercial channels ambushed us with advertisements seconds before the end of a cliff-hanger movie or basketball match. <br/><br/>Now, we can no longer even recognize the tricks used in real time to hold and sell our attention. Alienated from a market trading in us, we have become cogs in a production process that excludes us as anything but its product. <br/><br/>Data protection and privacy regulations are meant to return to us some of our lost autonomy regarding what we see, what guides our choices, and who knows what we choose. <br/><br/>But regulating Big Tech to protect our data and restore \"consumer sovereignty\" is not enough. Against a background of automation and labour casualization, these firms' monopoly profits boost inequality, fuel discontent, undermine aggregate demand for goods and services, and further destabilize capitalism. <br/><br/>The problem is that traditional government interventions are an exercise in futility: Taxing free services is pointless. Taxing robots, to fund humans, is as impossible as it is to define them. And while taxing Big Tech's profits is essential, these firms' skilled accountants and abundant opportunities to shift profits to different jurisdictions makes this difficult. <br/><br/>A simple solution exists, if we look beyond taxation. But it requires accepting that capital is no longer privately produced, as least not in the case of Google et al. <br/><br/>When James Watt built one of his famed steam engines, it was his creation, his product. A buyer who put the engine to work in, say, a textile factory could think of his profit stream as a just reward for having taken the risk of purchasing the machine and for the innovation of coupling it to a spinning jenny or a mechanical loom. <br/><br/>By contrast, Google cannot credibly argue that the capital generating its profit stream was produced entirely privately. Every time you use Google's search engine to look up a phrase, concept, or product, or visit a place via Google Maps, you enrich Google's capital. While the servers and software design, for example, have been produced capitalistically, a large part of Google's capital is produced by almost everyone. Every user, in principle, has a legitimate claim to being a de facto shareholder.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, while a substantial part of Big Tech's capital is produced by the public, there is no sensible way to compute personal contributions, which makes it impossible to calculate what our individual shares ought to be. <br/><br/>But this impossibility can be turned into a virtue, by creating a public trust fund to which companies like Google transfer a percentage \u2013 say, 10 per cent \u2013 of their shares. Suddenly, every child has a trust fund, with the accumulating dividends providing a universal basic income (UBI) that grows in proportion to automation and in a manner that limits inequality and stabilizes the macro-economy. <br/><br/>This attractive solution must overcome two obstacles. First, we tend to think of taxation as a panacea. But a UBI funded via taxation is sure to trigger a backlash among struggling working people who cannot see the logic of subsidizing the idle, rich or poor. Second, corporate shares are typically given to employees only. <br/><br/>To be sure, there are excellent reasons for taxing profits in order to fund benefits for the poor, and for worker-ownership schemes. But these are separate issues from the one at hand: how to stabilize society by granting property rights over Google's capital to everyone who helped create it, including unwaged carers, the precariously employed, and society's dropouts. <br/><br/>And then, as one would expect, there is the motivated fallacy peddled by the defenders of the status quo. The Financial Times' Alphaville column recently dismissed the case for transferring a block of shares from Big Tech corporations, like Google, to a public trust fund by misrepresenting the underlying argument as a failure to appreciate what Google has done for us. <br/><br/>To repudiate society's property rights over the returns to capital that we, as users, have created, Big Tech's defenders invoke users' large consumer surplus (the sum we would be prepared to pay for access to free services such as Gmail and Google Maps). <br/><br/>This is a little like justifying the confiscation of your shares in a company with the argument that the company is providing valuable services to you and others. In using Big Tech's services, we manufacture a portion of its capital in real time. Property rights over that portion \u2013 for all of us, rather than for any of us \u2013 must follow. - Project Syndicate <br/><br/> Muscat Media Group  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/42/89/92/154012865567.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/42/89/92/154012865567.jpg</url></p><p>A Google sign is seen at a Best Buy electronics store in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California.

Here are my guesses. </p><p>1) If you thought there was a lot of regulatory-induced tech investment after the Enron meltdown, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Companies still standing after the financial meltdown are going to see reporting and disclosure requirements that will be detailed and reach into every cranny of the corporate closet. They will also provide job opportunities for those laid-off financial wizards who will suddenly transform into-shazam!-consultants. Outsourcers, big tech vendors and all those new consulting companies will pile onto Wall Street as technology spending is touted as a way to prevent the meltdown from remelting.</p><p>2) Suddenly, the computer industry is going to look pretty good to all those college students and recent grads who skipped the computer business and flocked to the financial services industry. Despite dire predictions of outsourcing, computing in the cloud and visas for all, the computer industry looks to have some decent job prospects as the old code-pounders retire and businesses find that more of their financial future resides in keeping the computer systems running. I see an upturn in sales of used comp-sci textbooks as it becomes more important to have Java programming skills than a background in juggling financial derivatives.</p><p>3) There will be more job and high-tech start-up opportunities as companies seek to really understand their business. With the economic prospects looking shaky, companies will need to know where they are spending their dollars.

Confronted by the ghastly reality that some of their proudest creations - Google, Facebook and Twitter - helped propel Donald Trump into the White House, the tech titans of Silicon Valley are hitting esc like panic-stricken sophomores whose term papers have frozen before they clicked on the \"save\" icon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Content moderators\" are being hired by the thousand. Fake accounts are being closed. The News Feed is being \"fixed.\" Esc, esc, esc. But that page is still frozen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it will take more than esc to fix this. More like ctrl+alt+del.</p><p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. For a time, it seemed as if the internet was on democracy's side, helping the crowds in Cairo's Tahrir Square or Kiev's Maidan topple terrible tyrants.</p><p>\"Current network technology ... truly favours the citizens,\" wrote Google's Jared Cohen and Eric Schmidt in their 2013 book The New Digital Age. \"Never before have so many people been connected through an instantly responsive network,\" with truly \"game-changing\" implications for politics everywhere.</p><p>Mr. Cohen and Mr. Schmidt's 2010 article \"The Digital Disruption\" presciently argued that authoritarian governments would \"be caught off-guard when large numbers of their citizens, armed with virtually nothing but cellphones, take part in mini-rebellions that challenge their authority.\"</p><p>The \"real action\" in what they called \"the interconnected estate\" could be found in \"cramped offices in Cairo\" as well as \"on the streets of Tehran. From these locations and others, activists and technology geeks are rallying political 'flash mobs' that shake repressive governments, building new tools to skirt firewalls and censors, reporting and tweeting the new online journalism, and writing a bill of human rights for the internet age.\"</p><p>Even more euphoric was Mark Zuckerberg, the cofounder and chief executive of Facebook. In 2015, he called the internet \"a force for peace in the world.\" Connecting people on Facebook was building a \"common global community\" with a \"shared understanding\" of the problems confronting humanity.</p><p>Oh, happy days. Oh, glad, confident morning. Sadly, over the past two years, it has gradually become apparent that internet may pose a bigger threat to democracies than to dictators.</p><p>For one thing, the growth of network platforms with unprecedented data-gathering capabilities has created new opportunities for authoritarian regimes, not least in China and Russia, to control their own populations more effectively.</p><p>For another, the networks themselves offer ways in which bad actors - and not only the Russian government - can undermine democracy by disseminating fake news and extreme views. \"These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the west and east coasts,\" said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's digital-media director, in an interview last year. \"And we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they thought that would ever happen.\"</p><p>Too right.</p><p>Having initially dismissed as \"a pretty crazy idea\" the notion that fake news on Facebook had helped Mr. Trump to victory, Mr. Zuckerberg last year came clean: Russians using false identities had paid for 3,000 Facebook advertisements that sent implicitly pro-Trump messages to Americans before and after the election.</p><p>By some estimates, between 146 and 150 million users - more people than voted - had seen posts from accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a proKremlin organization, including around 16 million users of Instagram, which Facebook owns.</p><p>One analysis of six Russia-linked Facebook pages found their posts had been shared 340 million times. And those were just six of 470 pages that Facebook had identified as Russian. Trolls with false identities had also used Facebook Events (the company's event-management tool) to promote political protests in the United States, including an Aug. 27, 2016, antiimmigrant, anti-Muslim rally in a rural Idaho town known to welcome refugees.</p><p>In May, 2016, two Russian-linked Facebook groups had organized simultaneous opposing protests in front of the Islamic Da'wah Center of Houston. \"Heart of Texas,\" a bogus group claiming to favour Texas secession, had announced a noon rally on May 21 to \"Stop Islamification of Texas.\" Meanwhile, a separate Russiansponsored group, \"United Muslims of America,\" had advertised a \"Save Islamic Knowledge\" rally for exactly the same place and time. This wasn't the kind of global community Mr. Zuckerberg had envisaged.</p><p>This is not just an American story. To an extent that is not well enough appreciated, it is a global crisis of democracy.</p><p>Similar efforts were made, albeit on a smaller scale, to influence the outcome of the British referendum on European Union membership - mainly via fake Twitter accounts - as well as last year's elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. And the fact that the Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election has since become the focal point of multiple inquiries in Washington - which may even pose a threat to the legitimacy and longevity of Mr. Trump's presidency - does not mean that similar things are not going on in other countries even as you read this article. Canadians have good reason to worry about how social media could impact the 2019 federal election.</p><p>When Facebook and Twitter told MPs last year that they could increase public engagement in the debates between party leaders, some people wondered how much of this would be provided by Russian bots.</p><p>Yet the most alarming revelation of the past year is not the importance of Russian fake news, but its unimportance. Former president Barack Obama implicitly acknowledged that in his recent Netflix interview with David Letterman. Having swept into the White House in 2008 as the first candidate of the social media age, Obama acknowledged that he had \"missed ... the degree to which people who are in power, special interests, foreign governments, et cetera, can in fact manipulate [social media] and propagandize.\"</p><p>However, the former law professor made no attempt to lay all the blame on outside forces. \"What the Russians exploited,\" he said, \"was already here ... [The fact that] we are operating in completely different information universes. If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you listen to NPR. That's what's happening with these Facebook pages, where more and more people are getting their news from.</p><p>At a certain point, you just live in a bubble. And that's part of why our politics is so polarized right now.\"</p><p>What happened in 2016 was much more than just a Kremlin \"black op\" that exceeded expectations. It was a direct result of the profound change in the public sphere brought about by the advent and spectacular growth of the online network platforms. In many ways, the obsessive focus of the American political class on the Russian sub-plot is a distraction from the alarming reality that - as the European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager argued earlier this month - the big tech companies, and the way their services are used by ordinary people, pose a much bigger threat to democracy. It is the threat from within we really need to worry about - not the threat from Putin.</p><p>A POLARIZATION PROBLEM</p><p>We are nearly all addicts. The website eMarketer estimates that adult Facebook users in the United States spent roughly 41 minutes a day on the platform in 2017.</p><p>And that's just our favourite app. The average smartphone user clicks, taps and swipes that insidious little device an amazing 2,617 times a day.</p><p>And we don't just passively read. We engage. We like. We retweet. We reply. We comment. Now, it must be admitted that most of what we write is inane. In Canada, the five most-commonly used words in Facebook status updates are: \"day,\" \"hangover,\" \"loud,\" \"ticket\" and \"word.\"</p><p>(\"Hangover\" is ranked 7th in Britain and 8th in the United States - make of that what you will.)</p><p>But a fair amount of what we engage with online is news. Two-thirds of U.S.</p><p>adults are on Facebook. Nearly half - 45 per cent - get news from Mr. Zuckerberg's platform. More than one in 10 Americans get news from YouTube, while roughly the same proportion (11 per cent) get news from Twitter. In Canada, 51 per cent of people get their news from digital sources first. As a recent Harvard paper co-authored by Gary King demonstrates, the network platforms essentially amplify news from established news outlets. As they do so, however, a strange thing happens. Whether one looks at blogs or at Twitter, social media tend to promote polarization. Liberal bloggers link to liberal bloggers, rarely to conservative ones. Liberal Twitter users re-tweet one another, seldom their conservative counterparts. And tweets on political topics - gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change - are 20 per cent more likely to be retweeted for every moral or emotional word they employ.</p><p>Note also that political Twitter is not for everyone. As Daniel Hopkins, Ye Liu, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Lyle Ungar have shown, by analyzing nearly five million tweets generated by four thousand Twitter accounts in August, 2016, it is \"very conservative\" and \"very liberal\" users who are most likely to tweet political words.</p><p>We see a similar phenomenon when we analyze the Facebook followers of U.S.</p><p>legislators. In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the pattern is clear: The more ideologically out there you are - whether to the left or the right - the more followers you are likely to have.</p><p>In this context, it becomes apparent that Russian fake news represented a drop in an ocean of inflammatory political commentary that was overwhelmingly indigenous. Between March, 2015, and November, 2016, 128 million Americans created nearly 10 billion Facebook posts, shares, likes and comments about the election. Remember how many Russian ads there were? That's right: a paltry 3,000.</p><p>According to new research by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College, Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter, roughly one in four Americans saw at least one false story in the run-up to the presidential election. But fake stories were just 1 per cent of the news Hillary Clinton supporters read, and 6 per cent of the news Trump supporters read.</p><p>Remember, too, that not all the Russian-sourced news was fake. The tens of thousands of e-mails hacked from the accounts of John Podesta and other Democrats were as real as they were confidential. But it wasn't the Russians who were driving the traffic on the Breitbart website to record highs. It wasn't the Russians who explained to the Trump campaign how they could use targeted Facebook advertising to compensate - with precision - for what they lacked in dollars. It was Silicon Valley: its big data, its algorithms, its employees.</p><p>A MATTER OF PRIORITIES</p><p>Don't take it from me. Take it from former Facebook staff who have spoken out in the past year. Antonio Garcia Martinez, the former Facebook engineer and author of the book Chaos Monkeys, put it starkly: \"I think there's a real question if democracy can survive Facebook and all the other Facebook-like platforms,\" he said in an interview. \"Before platforms like Facebook, the argument used to be that you had a right to your own opinion. Now, it's more like the right to your own reality.\"</p><p>Facebook's propaganda was all about building a global community. But in practice, the company was laser-focused on the bottom line - and highly resistant to outside criticism. Sandy Parakilas, who worked as an operations manager to fix privacy problems on Facebook's developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering, has said that the company \"prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse.\"</p><p>\"When I was at Facebook,\" he said last year, \"the typical reaction I recall looked like this: Try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers.\" The policy was to \"react only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most scathing assessment came from former vice-president for user growth, Chamath Palihapitiya. \"I think,\" he told an audience of students at Stanford's Graduate School of Business in December, \"we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. ... The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works.</p><p>No civil discourse, no co-operation: misinformation, mistrust. And it's not an American problem - this is not about Russians ads. This is a global problem.\"</p><p>Mr. Palihapitiya said he felt \"tremendous guilt\" about his own part in this because he believed he and his former colleagues \"kind of knew something bad would happen.\" He is not alone in feeling guilty. Facebook's first president, Sean Parker, has talked in similar terms. Another early employee told Vanity Fair, \"Most of the early employees I know are totally overwhelmed by what this thing has become. They look at the role Facebook now plays in society ... and they have this sort of 'Oh my God, what have I done' moment.\"</p><p>True, in recent months Facebook has scrambled to respond to all this recrimination. On Sept. 21, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg pledged to work \"pro-actively to strengthen the democratic process.\"</p><p>Facebook would require that all political ads disclose which page paid for them and ensure that each ad is accessible to everyone. Later last year, he announced plans to clamp down on \"bad content and bad actors\" by doubling the number of employees and contractors who handle safety and security issues to 20,000 by the end of 2018. And just last week, he announced an overhaul of the News Feed to prioritize \"meaningful interaction\" between users over the kind of mediagenerated content that advertisers like.</p><p>But if you think this kind of self-regulation is going to fix democracy's socialmedia problem, then I have a bridge to sell you. For one thing, it would take at least an order of magnitude more people to achieve meaningful monitoring of the vast amount of content that Facebook's two billion-plus users produce and share every day. For another, none of this alters the company's fundamental business model, which is to sell advertisers the precision targeting that Facebook's user data allows. Political advertising may henceforth be identified as such, in the way that it is on television. But just how much less effective will that make it?</p><p>Google says it will curate its \"News\" search results more carefully, to rank established newspaper sites above bulletin boards such as 4chan or Reddit, which are favourite channels for alt-right content. Anyone who thinks that will stop people reading fake news hasn't found the \"scroll down\" button on their keyboard.</p><p>A NEW KIND OF POLITICS</p><p>The reality is, no matter how Facebook, Google and Twitter tweak their algorithms, a new kind of politics has been born. It can no more be unborn than the new kind of politics born when television revealed how much better-looking John F. Kennedy was than sweaty Richard Nixon, with his five o'clock shadow. Or how easily Lyndon Johnson could make Barry Goldwater seem like a man who wanted to drop atomic bombs on little children.</p><p>There are now two kinds of politicians in this world: the kind that know how to use social media as a campaign tool and the ones who lose elections. All over the world, the distinction is clear. The populists of the right and of the left understand the power of social media. The moderates who occupy the centre ground, with few exceptions - Justin \"Selfie\" Trudeau is one of them - are still playing by 1990s rules.</p><p>Among the few indicators that Mr. Trump had a good chance of beating Ms. Clinton were his enormous leads on Facebook and Twitter throughout the 2016 campaign. Applying similar metrics around the world yields startling results.</p><p>Take Britain, for example. The Leave campaign's victory in the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union owed a great deal to its pioneering use of Facebook advertising.</p><p>Yet the principal political beneficiary of Brexit - the woman who became prime minister shortly after the referendum, Theresa May - is a social-media loser, with little more than half a million Facebook followers and even less on Twitter.</p><p>By comparison, the Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn - a grizzled populist of the left in the style of Bernie Sanders - has 1.3 million followers on Facebook followers and 1.7 million on Twitter (numbers as of Jan. 18). No other British politician comes close. Boris Johnson is often mentioned in the same breath as Mr. Trump, but all the two men really have in common is big hair. Mr. Corbyn has four times more Twitter followers than \"BoJo.\"</p><p>Britain has no election scheduled for 2018 - although it is possible Ms. May's woefully weak government could fall as the economic costs of Brexit make themselves felt and the harsh realities of the EU's divorce terms become apparent.</p><p>Elsewhere, however, electorates are preparing to vote in general elections, notably in Brazil, Colombia, Italy and Mexico.</p><p>These contests will give us a chance to see how far the new politics has spread.</p><p>Start with Brazil, a country whose political elite has been battered by corruption scandals that led to the impeachment of the Workers' Party President Dilma Rouseff and probably disqualify her predecessor, Luiz Lula da Silva, from running this year. But who cares?</p><p>Lula has three million Facebook followers and just 189,000 Twitter followers. Far ahead of him on social media is Luciano Huck, the entrepreneur and television star, host of the hugely popular Saturday night TV show Caldeirao do Huck. With 17 million Facebook followers and nearly 13 million on Twitter, Mr. Huck is in a league of his own in Brazilian politics.</p><p>A Huck candidacy would be the Brazilian equivalent of Oprah Winfrey (FB 11.6m, TW 41.4m) running for president in 2020. He is not a populist; he's just popular. In second place, however, comes Jair Bolsonaro (FB 5m, TW 0.8m), the former army parachutist whose political positions make Mr. Trump seem like a lilylivered liberal. Mr. Bolsonaro is an unabashed defender of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985. Name any politically incorrect position; Mr. Bolsonaro has taken it.</p><p>\"I would never rape you,\" he once told a female politician, \"because you do not deserve it.\"</p><p>Italian politics was in many ways the experimental laboratory for the kind of candidate who combines wealth and celebrity with political incorrectness. Silvio Berlusconi has claimed, not without justification, to have been the prototype Trump. Despite a criminal conviction, Mr. Berlusconi is still a political player, though more of a kingmaker than a candidate these days. Yet he is behind the times (FB 1m, TW 19,300). The King of Twitter in Italy is former prime minister Matteo Renzi (FB 1.1m, TW 3.34m), although on Facebook he trails the populists: the two Five Star Movement leaders, Beppe Grillo (FB 1.9m, TW 2.5m) and Luigi di Maio (FB 1.1m, TW 0.3m), as well as the Northern League leader Matteo Salvini (FB 1.9m, TW 0.6m).</p><p>In Mexico, the best-known populist - Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, universally known by his initials as \"AMLO\" - is a man of the left. On social media (FB 2.3m, TW 3.5m), AMLO is far ahead of the likely PRI nominee Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade (FB 0.3m, TW 1m) and his PAN (National Action Party) counterpart Ricardo Anaya Cortes (FB 0.9m, TW 0.4m). True, AMLO is not the most followed Mexican politician: Rafael Moreno Valle, the former governor of Puebla, is now neck-andneck with him on Facebook. Only just behind AMLO on Twitter is the mayor of Mexico City, Miguel Angel Mancera. But neither Moreno Valle nor Mancera is going to be a presidential candidate.</p><p>Politics on Colombian social media also leans left. There, the leading figure is Gustavo Petro (FB 0.9m, TW 2.8m), the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, who as a young man belonged to the guerrilla group the 19th of April Movement and who made his political reputation as an opponent of the conservative presidency of \u00c1lvaro Uribe.</p><p>THE INESCAPABLE THREAT</p><p>It used to be that all politics was local.</p><p>Today, perhaps, all politics is becoming social, in that social media have emerged as the crucial battleground of modern elections. Just a few years ago, that would have seemed like a good idea. What could be more democratic, after all, than enabling politicians to communicate their messages directly to individual voters, and to hear back from them in real time? The only thing to worry about was whether or not online speech was truly free - the core preoccupation of Freedom House's annual \"Freedom on the Net\" survey.</p><p>But what if the biggest threat to democracy is not online censorship or surveillance, but the near-total absence of regulation of politics on social media?</p><p>The public is beginning to sense this. A new Gallup-Knight survey, published last week, revealed that 57 per cent of Americans think that the way sites choose which stories to show to users presents \"a major problem\" for democracy. Just less than half of those interviewed favoured regulation of how the network platforms provide news.</p><p>The difficulty is knowing what form regulation should take. As Sam Lessin - another former Facebooker - has argued, the real transformation of the public sphere is that a candidate \"can for the first time effectively talk to each individual voter privately in their own home and tell them exactly what they want to hear ... in a way that can't be tracked or audited.\"</p><p>Forget fake news, Mr. Lessin argues.</p><p>Forget the \"feed bubbles\" and \"echo chambers\" that have dominated the discussion in the United States. The real challenge is not that the public sphere has grown polarized. The challenge is that it has been so fragmented by misnamed social media that it is no longer a single public sphere.</p><p>\"It has been a foregone conclusion for a long time,\" Mr. Lessin concludes, doubtless remembering the inspirational Zuckerberg speeches of the pre-2016 era, \"that the internet has been a vehicle for moving us toward speaking one common language and being able to work together to solve the great problems of our era. ... The sad reality is that the most exciting attempt to bring our world together is putting us at risk of not being able to trust what we see or hear\" - but (and this is the point he missed) voting for the most engaging candidate anyway.</p><p>Hit \"esc\" all you like. This is the real - and inescapable - threat facing every democracy today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180120opfergusonnetworks</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFN-DS91-F06S-32R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

New rules? Tougher enforcement? Break them up?</p><p>That is a hot topic in the United States, and in other countries. And it was a theme at The New York Times DealBook conference last week, addressed most pointedly by two participants: Makan Delrahim, chief of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html\">Bill Gates</url>, a co-founder of Microsoft, the target of the government\u2019s last big case against a technology company.</p><p>Policing the Big Tech companies, Mr. Delrahim said, should be left to the nation\u2019s federal competition officials rather than beefed-up regulation.</p><p>Congress is looking at creating a new digital authority or significantly expanding the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the tech giants. In congressional hearings, expert witnesses have made that recommendation.</p><p>Other countries, including Australia and Britain, have either set up or are creating regulatory agencies focused on digital markets, as a way to respond more quickly to allegations of anticompetitive practices and other abuses.</p><p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t go there,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said.</p><p>Antitrust laws, dating back a century, he said, should be nimble and flexible enough to cope with competition issues in the fast-moving digital markets. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge for us,\u201d he said.</p><p>[Video:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html\">Watch on YouTube.</url>]</p><p>Traditional antitrust enforcement has relied on higher consumer prices as a key signal of monopoly power and anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>But the internet services from Google and Facebook are free to consumers. The old yardstick no longer applies, prompting calls for new rules for the digital giants.</p><p>Prices matter, Mr. Delrahim said, but he emphasized that they were only one consideration in antitrust enforcement. Others, he said, are the impact a dominant company\u2019s actions have on consumer choice, quality of service and innovation.</p><p>Free offerings are not new in antitrust law.</p><p>In the Microsoft case in the 1990s, Mr. Delrahim noted, the company bundled its Internet Explorer browsing software to its dominant Windows system as a free add-on. That undermined competition from a new competitor, Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in internet browsing software.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Delrahim was a young lawyer working on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings on Microsoft. Asked if he were in the Justice Department then, would he have pursued the Microsoft suit?</p><p>\u201cI absolutely think that was a case to bring,\u201d Mr. Delrahim replied.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Gates disagreed. And he recalled his time at the center of an antitrust case and the personal and corporate energy consumed by it.</p><p>Microsoft was found guilty of repeatedly violating antitrust laws, and in a settlement agreed to stop some tactics.</p><p>Asked if the suit made the technology market more competitive, Mr. Gates said: \u201cNo. Everyone else can say that if they want. It\u2019s not true to me, and I will never change that opinion.\u201d</p><p>[Video:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html\">Watch on YouTube.</url>]</p><p>Still, Mr. Gates said, the lawsuit hurt Microsoft, distracting him and the company from moving quickly enough in new markets, like mobile computing and cellphones. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a pro-consumer thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>The most drastic remedy would be to break up the Big Tech companies. The most detailed proposal is a split-up plan for Facebook from two antitrust experts, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, and Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook.</p><p>They propose forcing Facebook to shed two companies it acquired \u2014 Instagram, a photo-sharing service, and WhatsApp, a messaging service. Those purchases, they say, were the biggest ones in a Facebook campaign to take over nascent competitors. A century ago, Standard Oil was broken up under a similar theory of \u201cpredatory\u201d acquisitions as an anticompetitive strategy.</p><p>At the DealBook conference, Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, was skeptical that breaking up Big Tech companies would be an appropriate or effective solution to the perceived problem: the power the companies have over the economy and public discourse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that if you were to peel off WhatsApp and Instagram, that all of a sudden solves that problem,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have two and a half billion people on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>He also defended big companies buying small ones as often vital to accelerate the spread of innovation, given the greater reach and resources of large corporations.

The era of Silicon Valley will end, supplanted by the imperatives of fighting climate change and competing with China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This would be a momentous change.</p><p>The biggest tech companies - Amazon. com, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Google (Alphabet Inc.) and (a bit surprisingly) Microsoft Corp. - have increasingly dominated both the headlines and the U.S. stock market.</p><p>Many speculated that online network effects would lead these companies to command private industry in ways that none had before. Imagine Amazon handling all shopping needs, Facebook all social media and so on. Meanwhile, the dramatic success of these companies got investors excited about finding the next tech behemoth. They poured money into businesses such as Uber Technologies, Lyft, Snap Inc., Tesla Motors and WeWork, igniting a second technology boom and sending talent streaming into Silicon Valley, New York City, Seattle and a few other hubs.</p><p>But tech's long boom may finally be running into some constraints. For the big companies, the constraint is political: The increased power of a few seemingly unaccountable giants has renewed an interest in antitrust. People are worried about Amazon's hardball negotiations with cities, Facebook's supposed violations of privacy and tolerance of fake news, and/or Google's alleged bias, as well as these companies' ability to squash smaller competitors.</p><p>In keeping with this sentiment, Sen.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren recently unveiled a plan to break up and/or regulate large tech companies, declaring that these businesses have become so systemically important to the economy that they should be treated as public utilities. In addition to unwinding large tech mergers - for example, forcing Facebook to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp - she proposed heavily regulating Google's search engine. She would also force Amazon to spin off units that sell products on its platform, preventing the e-commerce giant from competing against its third-party users.</p><p>For newer tech companies, the constraints are more practical - there may simply not be room for any more gods in the big tech pantheon. Uber and Lyft are preparing monster IPOs, but they still consistently fail to turn a profit, possibly because of a basic inability to protect themselves from competition. Snap hasn't even been able to log positive cash flow from operations, meaning it's still being kept afloat by investor dollars despite being a public company. Tesla has the chance to become one of the world's giant car companies, but might spend too much money and force itself into bankruptcy. And Netflix is looking less like a platform and more like a conventional movie and television studio company.</p><p>Meanwhile, if someone is about to produce another consumer technology on par with computers, the internet, the smartphone, and social media, it's not apparent what that will be. Socalled artificial intelligence is the hot new thing, but it's more of a back-end technology that makes other applications work more effectively - in other words, not subject to the same kind of strong network effects that give Amazon, Google, and Facebook their dominance. AI can help drive productivity improvements, but might not deliver the stock returns investors have become used to.</p><p>So while things are still very uncertain, there are good reasons to believe in Sen's thesis that information technology won't be the economic engine it once was - at least not for investors, and perhaps not for the broader economy, either. But the assumption that government will take tech's place has some problems. All the big important things that government might want to do over the next decade involve a significant amount of technology.</p><p>Consider the fight against climate change. The most urgent tasks in creating a carbon-free economy, both in the U.S. and abroad, involve technology and innovation. These include producing better batteries and other forms of energy storage, transmitting electricity from place to place without big energy losses, finding ways to make cement and heat homes without releasing carbon, and developing ways to capture carbon cheaply from the air.</p><p>Government research can and should help achieve breakthroughs in those areas, but much of the work of making the technologies cheap, practical, and ubiquitous can best be accomplished by the private sector. So expect an increase in government subsidies, public-private partnerships, and infrastructure contracts in the green energy sector.</p><p>The other major government imperative is the burgeoning high-tech rivalry with China. Much of this competition will be in the AI field: The country that can develop better machine learning systems will have a natural advantage in networked and precision weaponry, cyberwarfare, espionage and a number of other strategically important areas. In this new space race, the U.S. probably won't be able to afford demolishing the pools of talent, capital, and technology represented by its big companies. Google, for example, with its world-leading Google Brain project, as well as Amazon Web Services, will become more important to national security.</p><p>So one distinct possibility is that big tech won't be supplanted by government - instead, the two will merge.</p><p>Large tech companies will be able to keep their dominant positions in exchange for greater regulation and greater cooperation with the government in the race against China and the fight to save the climate. Just as Ford and General Motors became arms of the U.S. war effort in World War II and IBM helped out during the Cold War, Google, Amazon, and other modern cutting-edge companies may become closer to the government.</p><p>Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Mass employee organization, demands made of management \u2014 doesn\u2019t that all vaguely remind you of some kind of old-fashioned twentieth-century concept? What was it called again? The name\u2019s on the tip of my tongue, I swear\u2026 A participant said, \u201cJust the threat of us walking out was enough for the company to remove DeVaul from the payroll,\u201d referring to Richard DeVaul, the Googleexecutive who resigned this week amid a swirling storm of accusations of sexual harassment and worse. </p><p>Meanwhile, an organizer of the walkout said, plaintively, \u201cI hope I still have a career in Silicon Valley after this\u201d \u2026 while other organizers declined to go on the record. If only there were some formal, structured way in which tech employees could bring grievances to their management, and negotiate with them as a group, via, say, elected representatives, for whom protection from retaliation could be established. Surely the disruptors and out-of-the-box thinkers of Silicon Valley could come up with some revolutionary new system for that. Imagine \u2014 and I know this sounds like science fiction but bear with me \u2014 one day, such a structure might even achieve some kind of special legal recognition and protections. But what would they call it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe, and I\u2019m just spitballing here, they could call it a \u201cunion\u201d or something crazy like that. After the set operation, get it? They like math entendres down at Google, after all\u2026 I am not necessarily saying such a concept is all benefit and no cost. I\u2019m not even saying I think it would necessarily be a net good idea. But it is striking to me how nobody seems to have even publicly considered the possibility, under the circumstances. I get that the Valley idea of a union is basically that of a terrible hidebound boa constrictor which chokes off all hope of speed and/or innovation. That might well be true, if one were to simply try to apply twentieth-century union notions, ones which tried to control hours worked and physical conditions, because those were the primary concerns of the manufacturing and/or otherwise physical laborers of that era. But it surprises me greatly that nobody seems to even be talking about a \u201cUnion 2.0\u201d concept, one built for 21st-century software engineers rather than 20th-century auto workers, one which didn\u2019t necessarily sacrifice speed, flexibility, or openness to experimentation. Not least because such could have important repercussions beyond the companies in question. Big tech companies have become among the most powerful entities in the world, at least indirectly. An argument about government regulation of tech is often that it is both heavy-handed and so slow that by the time it finally happens it applies to the tech of several years ago and is already essentially obsolete. This is often a fair criticism, and often applies to legal restitution too. So what are the checks and balances for Big Tech? What forces and people can keep them honest? The obvious answer is: their employees. Googleand Facebook and company fear unrest among their tens of thousands of employees far more than they do the anger of a few hundred million users around the world. It\u2019s by no means a perfect lever of influence, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Whether you want to call it a union or not, I can\u2019t help but think that a more formal structure for grievances, collective negotiation, and protection from reprisal, among employees of major tech companies, might just be a pretty good idea for everyone. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN963741320181105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TN9-GPK1-J9XT-P02M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That is not the only connection between tech and plumbing. The water and sewage industry offers clues to the vexed question of how to regulate the Silicon Valley \"platform\" firms, such as Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. The implications are mildly terrifying for the companies, so any tech tycoons reading this column might want to secure a spare pair of trousers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In America and in Europe a consensus is emerging that big tech firms must be tamed. Their dominance of services such as search and social media gives them huge economic and political clout. The $3trn total market value of America's five biggest tech firms (Apple and Microsoft are the other two) suggests that investors believe they are among the most powerful firms in history, up there with the East India Company and Standard Oil.</p><p>Trustbusters in need of instant gratification want to break up the companies, but this might make their services less useful (imagine having ten social-media accounts), and network effects might mean that one of the tiddlers would grow dominant again. Others want tech firms to license their patents for nothing, as AT&amp;T was required to do in 1956. This might create startups tomorrow, but will not stop firms exploiting monopolies today.</p><p>An alternative is to regulate these companies like utilities\u2014monopolies with high market shares that provide an essential service from which it is expensive for consumers to switch. Here, the water industry is relevant, particularly the concept of a regulated asset base (RAB). It emerged in the 1990s when Britain was privatising its water firms, borrowing elements from American regulation. It is an acronym that few in Silicon Valley are aware of. But from these obscure origins RAB frameworks are now common in Europe and Latin America, used to regulate at least $400bn-worth of power, airport, water and telecoms assets.</p><p>The idea is that the monopolist's profits should not exceed the level that a competitive market would allow. That means estimating the cost to an imaginary new entrant of replicating the incumbent's assets (this is the RAB) and calculating the profits the newcomer would make if its returns matched its cost of capital. The actual monopoly's earnings should not exceed this amount. Safeguards are added to ensure the utility is run efficiently, keeping costs low. Regulators review the framework every few years.</p><p>How might utility-style regulation work for Silicon Valley firms? Consider a thought experiment with Facebook. Its 1.3bn users pay nothing, but give it their data and control over the adverts they see. Facebook then sells advertisers targeted access to its users, pulling in $27bn last year. Imagine that the service were \"unbundled\", giving users control. All would own their data and could choose whether to sell them to advertisers. They would also have to pay Facebook a fee to compensate it for the cost of creating and operating the network.</p><p>The big question is how much compensation\u2014profits\u2014Facebook and other firms would deserve if they were treated as utilities. It is possible to get a rough idea. Assume a cost of capital of 12%\u2014a high figure to reflect the risk inherent in tech firms' models. Estimating their RABs is harder. They have some physical assets such as data centres, but unlike utilities their main resources are not pylons, pipes and property, but software and ideas that they create or acquire by buying rivals. Only some of these intangibles appear on their balance-sheets; the vast sums spent on research and development (R&amp;D) do not. But you can reconfigure their balance-sheets as if all their R&amp;D in the past had been recognised as an asset with a 20-year life. Alphabet and Facebook would have a combined RAB of $160bn. If their returns were capped at 12%, operating profits would fall by 65% and 81% respectively.</p><p>If their services were unbundled, users would benefit. Using figures from 2016, the average Facebook user would pay $15 a year to the firm for its return on its RAB, but they would pocket $23 from selling advertisers their data and the right to be advertised to. A Google user would pay $37 a year to Google, but collect $45 from advertisers. Those are fairly small sums, but richer users with particularly valuable data could make much more. </p><p>Regulating tech like water would cause an outcry among investors and in Silicon Valley. Yet some of the objections do not stack up. Essential investment would still happen\u2014a guaranteed 12% return is a handsome reward. The firms could invest in new technologies that would remain outside the regulated utility. It would be possible to work out which assets sit abroad and exclude them from the RAB, or to reach arrangements with foreign regulators.</p><p>This approach would have shortcomings, though. Tech moves at the speed of light compared with conventional utilities. It was only five years ago that investors worried that Facebook would struggle with the shift to mobile phones. Regulators would be clumsy at coping with rapid change. And a RAB methodology would not resolve the incendiary issue of whether tech platforms should be responsible for what they publish. </p><p>Despite such problems, tech bosses should view regulation as utilities as a long-term risk. They have two defences. First, to bundle their services so tightly that it is impossible for outsiders to isolate the products that are monopolies and work out their profits and assets. Amazon is a master here. It is unclear how much it makes or has invested in e-commerce (where it is dominant), videos (where it is a challenger), or food (where it is a new entrant).</p><p>The second defence is to lobby Washington. The lesson from America's veteran oligopolists\u2014airline, telecoms and health-care companies\u2014is that you can manipulate and dance around the regulatory system to ensure high profits. For tech firms, financial obfuscation and cronyism are the most effective ways to ensure their monopoly profits do not go down the drain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-I36OE0P</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ4-JHH1-DY2R-2201-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The more startling change, however, is the evolution of not his own views but other people's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think the most stunning surprise about the state of the world at the moment,\" Smith said in an interview with POLITICO, \"is to see such a profound lack of optimism in the future, by so many people, in a time of great prosperity.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is an angry and agitated age, for a long index of reasons, but one theme woven through many of them is very much in Smith's arena: a pervasive perception that the digital revolution broadly has turned from light to dark. </p><p>Only recently we hailed technology as a wondrous force for individual empowerment and global connection. Now it is commonly viewed, on the right and the left, as a menacing force for economic dislocation and political division-an instrument of surveillance, manipulation and control by all manner of cynical and malicious actors, in government and the private sector, at home and around the world.</p><p>At high altitude, the world basically has three models for confronting the digital revolution. China sees technology as a way to implement its futuristic vision of the orderly world: approved media only, surveillance everywhere, \"social credit scores\" for everyone. Russia sees technology as a way to implement its nostalgic vision of a disorderly world: using spying and social media to sow misinformation and discord around the world in way meant to restore the power Moscow lost at the end of the Cold War.</p><p>In the middle between these dystopias, are the United States and its fellow liberal democracies-lacking a coherent vision of how to ensure that technology serves the public interest, improvising in clumsy and ad hoc fashion as one crisis or another pushes this or that issue up the agenda.</p><p>Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age is Smith's effort, co-authored by his Microsoft colleague Carol Ann Browne, to make this improvisation less clumsy and more effective. Essentially, they are pleading for a digital equivalent of what, in the Cold War, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called \"the vital center,\" in which conscientious business leaders engage with conscientious public officials to craft a creative alternative to both the Chinese and the Russian examples, reaping the benefits of innovation while mitigating the costs.</p><p>The book commands interest partly because of the moment but even more because of Smith. He is not a programming genius or a guru of product design and marketing. Instead, he is the silky and itinerant ambassador from the Empire of Microsoft to the rest of the world. He is a familiar face-more so than Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella-at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Munich Security Conference, the Aspen Ideas Festival and the Supreme Court, in newsroom editorial boards and, above all, in the legislative and regulatory chambers of Washington and Brussels.</p><p>In a book that traverses widely across such subjects as artificial intelligence, consumer privacy, cyberwarfare, the excesses and vulnerabilities of social media, and the rise of China, Smith and Browne rest their argument on three main pillars:</p><p>*Regulation is good for the public interest and not bad for the tech industry.</p><p>This is different from the pose of disdain for puffed-up politicians and clueless regulators that marked Microsoft a generation ago, and still marks many of its younger and swashbuckling counterparts.</p><p>Smith lauds European regulators for taking the lead in establishing clear rules around electronic privacy. Much like automakers, who say they actually prefer California's tougher emission standards to a patchwork of different rules in multiple other states, Microsoft's position is that it can benefit from clear and sensible standards that apply to everyone and reinforce confidence among consumers.</p><p>Microsoft, of course, can thrive in a regulated market; it's got the market power that comes from massive size, and an army of lawyers and lobbyists working for Smith who can ensure the company's goals are represented. But he says it is inevitable that other tech firms as they mature will come to see regulation, on such issues as ethical uses of artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, as enlightened self-interest.</p><p>*This stuff seems new and scary, but it isn't.</p><p>Actually, Smith and Browne acknowledge there is a lot about the radically disruptive nature of technology that can be plenty scary, especially if poorly managed. Their point is that the clash of legitimate values-between privacy and law enforcement, for instance-has marked innovative technologies throughout history, and there's no reason to be fatalistic.</p><p>A close analogy to the modern tech industry, they assert, is the unregulated railroad industry of the 1880s, which dominated the economy because basically everything important traveled over its tracks. That created ample potential for abuse and profiteering. In due course, even the railroads yearned for a strong national government role as opposed to fighting for its interests in individual states, and the modern regulatory state was born. New technology invites something like this on a global scale.</p><p>*Everyone should just be more reasonable.</p><p>There is not, the authors acknowledge, a global equivalent of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and there is not likely to be anytime soon. Still, it's possible for responsible people to replicate approximately the functionality of these bodies if those people would come together in the spirit of goodwill and problem-solving.</p><p>\"One thesis of this book,\" Smith and Brown write, \"is that it is more than possible for companies to succeed while doing more to address their societal responsibilities.\" And: \"Many issues also will require compromise.\" In curbing abuses on social media: \"Initiatives from the public and private sectors will likely need to move forward together and complement each other.\"</p><p>All very reasonable ... soothing even.</p><p>One problem: Smith might have noticed that many people in public life, here and abroad, don't come off as especially reasonable. The rejoinder to his argument is that all his earnest professions to compromise on privacy and to be sensible about AI and vigilant about election security, etc. etc. seem like a fairly flaccid response given the ferocity of the challenges that technology is imposing on modern society.</p><p>The rejoinder to the rejoinder would be: Got any other good ideas? </p><p>The great weakness of liberal democracies is that they tend to dither and muddle along, while authoritarian societies can organize themselves ruthlessly around certain objectives. The great advantage of liberal democracies is that they tend to be more creative and flexible in creating wealth and solving problems over the long term.</p><p>At such a moment, it's notable that people like Smith, who has made a career of navigating political and legal complexity, are increasingly the face of Big Tech in global capitals. It might be monomaniacal geniuses like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs who create the technology breakthroughs, but it is people like Smith-along with former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg-who are more comfortable and comforting presences in the traditional arenas of power.</p><p>Meanwhile, if Washington would shake off its current sourness and malaise, Smith said in the interview, the problems of the digital age actually would present both parties with \"natural starting points\" where they could compete for voters by playing to traditional advantages. Expanding broadband access to rural areas and impoverished communities is a natural area of interest for Republicans' belief in the power of using tax credits and other incentives to stimulate private-sector interest in solving problems. New regulations to protect privacy, meanwhile, fit comfortably within the Democrats' legacy of standing up for consumers against corporate predations.</p><p>Politicians who want to use their power to regulate technology, of course, must first win that power. Smith argues that Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 in significant part because he and allies at the Republican National Committee had a \"more effective data strategy\" than Hillary Clinton's campaign. The big question for 2020 is whether the eventual Democratic nominee can catch up or even \"leapfrog\" the incumbent.</p><p>\"The combination of technology and data [is] changing the nature of the interaction between individuals\" that is at the essence of any campaign's effort to persuade and mobilize supporters. \"Regardless of whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, the future of your political success turns on the use of data. ...

Your officeholders and candidates and, perhaps most fundamentally, political parties need to have an effective data strategy.\" </p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-228100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1T-31Y1-F118-92HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1541\"/><timeReceived>9:19 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

We were lucky enough to tune into a pre-release of a podcast discussion between Amy James, co-inventor of the Open Index Protocol, and Dr. Epstein.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><br/>As interesting as the Senate testimony is, it should also be read alongside an article published in July last year on the policy implications of making Google's index a \"public utility.\"<br/><br/>In the article Epstein argues that breaking up \"Big Tech\" won't work: \"Breaking up Google's search engine would give us a smattering of search engines that yield inferior results (the larger the search engine, the wider the range of results it can give you), and breaking up Facebook's platform would be like building an immensely long Berlin Wall that would splinter millions of relationships.\"</p><p>\"... breaking up Facebook's platform would be like building an immensely long Berlin Wall that would splinter millions of relationships.\"</p><p>In short, breaking up 'Big Tech' won't protect users from the surveillance, content suppression and behavioural manipulation algorithms that Epstein and a growing collective of thinkers perceive to be surreptitiously taking over the Internet.<br/><br/>Today Google: is used by around 2.5 billion people, indexing upwards of 45 billion page pages a day. That's a global resource, and a significant degree of information control, for a single United States corporation. In 2018 a leaked video on influencing human values from a Google design lab, entitled the 'Selfish Ledger.' The video led to the kind of scrutiny that changes to search indexing, auto-suggestions, or invasive privacy customizations had somehow completely evaded.<br/><br/>Rather than singling out Google, a better conversation might be more education on just how influential many digital technologies are becoming; in particular, the temptations of vast data sets when concentrated and centralized in any single institution. For example, is there are reasons to believe governments, if provided with the same resources, would behave differently? For billions of people living in authoritarian countries, Silicon Valley's privacy laws are benign when compared to almost any currently existing alternative.</p><p>Given the increasing saturation of technology into every elements of our lives, it might be time for the separation of powers we find in our democratic political systems, to be mirrored in cyberspace.</p><p><br/><br/>The Separation of Powers in Cyberspace<br/><br/>Given the increasing saturation of technology into every elements of our lives, it might be time for the separation of powers we find in our democratic political systems, to be mirrored in cyberspace. The alternative option is to vest massive informational, surveillance and broadcast power in the hands of the few; be it a corporation, governments, or any number of supranational institutions.</p><p>In the case of Internet search, Epstein argues that \"\u2014the mammoth and ever-growing database,\" Google maintains should be transformed into a \"public commons.\"<br/><br/>If that sounds a little unfair, remember no one provided Google bots permission to ingest the world's web pages into a mega-index, or delist websites in a way that can determine the success or failure of a business, and even influence stock markets.</p><p>In the case of Internet search, Epstein argues that \"\u2014the mammoth and ever-growing database,\" Google maintains should be transformed into a \"public commons.\"</p><p>This argument regards the Internet as a resource as necessary for existence as electricity, water, or telecommunications. A possible precedent would be the 1956 consent decree in the U.S., in which the massive telecoms carrier AT&amp;T was obligated to share its patents with other companies, free of charge. Of course there are significant differences between a national telecoms carrier and a global information network.<br/><br/>While such a suggestion might enrage free-marketers, it could potentially spur innovation. The bloomberg article predicts that \"variants would turn up within months; within a year or two, thousands of new search platforms might emerge, each with different strengths and weaknesses.\" These platforms would evoke the index subset in different ways, creating new revenue models and niche offerings that are impossible in the current search context. The \"alternative,\" Epstein argues, \"is frightening.\"<br/><br/>Epstein's arguments are part of what I would suggest is a growing chorus for the \"separation of powers\" in cyberspace. Alongside the technical policy prescriptions, it might be time to begin asking \"What does freedom on the Internet actually look like?\" How can ideas inherited from Franklin, Paine and the Enlightenment merge with this technical debate, to engineer a core internet architecture which remains free, distributed, yet still innovative?</p><p>\"what does freedom on the Internet actually look like?\"</p><p>Above all, how do we go beyond \"access\" to ensure that cyberspace remains a place where anyone can build, speak and make money without having unfair competition and regulations imposed at every turn? Next week we'll review the evolution of the early Internet, and the ideas of Lessig, Sir Tim Berners Lee, Barlow and others to find answers to these questions.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: Al Bawaba is experimenting with the Open Index Protocol.

But in fact, there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/ccpa-privacy-for-all-act/\">countless tech companies</url>, like mine, that believe that people have a fundamental right to avoid being put under surveillance and that it should be easy for them to exercise that right. By contrast, it is the big ad-tech companies \u2014 especially Facebook and Google \u2014 that do not want to make it easy for consumers to avoid profiling, because their business models rely on it. They are resisting change to other proven models of advertising, even though other companies are showing that it works.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This distinction between Big Ad Tech and everyone else in tech is important to keep in mind as policymakers consider new regulations intended to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. Executives of these big companies may individually make public statements <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.0a706aa010da\">welcoming federal regulation</url>, but in practice they are doing everything they can to weaken existing laws and shape new ones in their own interests. This strategy is very obvious to the rest of us in the tech industry. And it\u2019s essential to get these privacy laws right today, so that people have the opportunity to opt out of online tracking now.</p><p>The most significant example of Big Ad Tech\u2019s influence on privacy regulation is in California, which passed the California Consumer Privacy Act in 2018. Industry groups representing Big Ad Tech are leading the charge to weaken the law through <url normalizedValue=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB753\">amendments</url> that would exempt the sharing of personal data for ads, as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90338036/how-big-tech-is-trying-to-shape-californias-landmark-privacy-law\">Fast Company recently reported.</url> This type of \u201cexemption\u201d is not a minor change; it would weaken the law so much as to make it almost meaningless. As Jacob Snow of the A.C.L.U. of Northern California       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90338036/how-big-tech-is-trying-to-shape-californias-landmark-privacy-law\">put it</url>, \u201cA privacy law shouldn\u2019t have a targeted advertisement exception for the same reason that an environmental law shouldn\u2019t have a coal mining exception.\u201d</p><p>Groups like the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which has board members from <url normalizedValue=\"https://itif.org/people/board\">several big tech companies</url>, are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://itif.org/publications/2019/01/14/grand-bargain-data-privacy-legislation-america\">lobbying</url> in Washington for similar ad-tech exemptions federally, as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182051/data-privacy-congress-grand-bargain-proposal-democrats-amazon-google-facebook-ccpa-coppa-hipaa\">The Verge has reported.</url> They argue that strong privacy laws would hurt the digital ad market, create high costs for businesses and curb innovation.</p><p>These are all weak arguments. There is no reason to fear that sites cannot still make money with advertising. That\u2019s because there are already two kinds of highly profitable online ads: contextual ads, based on the content being shown on screen, and behavioral ads, based on personal data collected about the person viewing the ad. Behavioral ads work by tracking your online behavior and compiling a profile about you using your internet activities (and even your offline activities in some cases) to send you targeted ads.</p><p>Contextual advertising doesn\u2019t need to know anything about you: Search for \u201ccar\u201d and you get a car ad. Over the past decade, contextual ads have been displaced by behavioral ads, aided by the rise of real-time bidding technology that auctions off each ad on a site based on user profiling. These behavioral ads are the ones that leave a bad taste in your mouth. They follow you around from website to mobile app based on your private information and, intentionally or not, enable online <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/28/facebook-hud-discrimination/\">discrimination</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-for-the-first-time-acknowledges-election-manipulation/\">manipulation</url> and the creation of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles\">filter bubbles</url>.</p><p>Strong privacy laws will force the digital advertising industry to return to its roots in contextual advertising. That\u2019s a good thing, since contextual advertising does not affect privacy in the same way. (My company uses only contextual advertising, and we compete with Google.) </p><p>In fact, Google search advertising began and still largely operates this way. When you enter a search request in Google, it displays ads that are relevant to that particular search, without needing to collect information about your search, location, purchase or browsing history. However, Google still collects all this information because it also powers non-search behavioral ads across the whole internet, on <url normalizedValue=\"https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856?hl=en-GB\">more than two million websites and apps</url> that use Google\u2019s ad services and on Google\u2019s non-search properties,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2454017?hl=en\">such as YouTube</url>. Once people are allowed to opt out of behavioral advertising, then online ads for those who do can go back to being more like non-creepy contextual search ads.</p><p>[If you use technology, someone is using your information. We\u2019ll tell you how \u2014 and what you can do about it. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</url>.]</p><p>This shift back to contextual advertising need not reduce profitability. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-most-publishers-dont-benefit-from-behavioral-ad-targeting/\">recent poll</url> by Digiday of publishing executives found that 45 percent of them saw no significant benefit from behavioral ads, and 23 percent said they actually caused a decline in revenue. </p><p>What about compliance costs? Companies are quickly realizing that good privacy practices are a boon for business. People increasingly want to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/\">reduce their digital footprint</url> and so choose companies that help them do so. Companies with good privacy practices in their DNA do not face significant compliance costs.</p><p>And if there is anything stifling innovation in Silicon Valley, it is the dominance of Big Ad Tech, wrought by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/surveillance-capitalism-has-gone-rogue-we-must-curb-its-excesses/2019/01/24/be463f48-1ffa-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.5e058ae81558\">surveillance capitalism</url> business model. When contextual advertising regains prominence, more companies will be able to compete against Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s ad networks because they won\u2019t need huge troves of personal data to do so. Additionally, strong privacy laws will spur innovations to help companies use data in a privacy-respecting manner. In some fields, such as services that help businesses analyze how people use their sites, this innovation and resurgence of competition has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90300072/its-time-to-ditch-google-analytics\">already begun</url>.</p><p>I am reminded of the arguments made in the 1960s and \u201970s about laws to reduce toxic emissions from cars. Companies profiting from less regulation lobbied against those laws, and yet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/accomplishments-and-success-air-pollution-transportation\">once they were enacted</url>, Americans\u2019 health improved, innovations such as the modern catalytic converter entered the market, and big companies met the new emissions targets without catastrophic expense. If we enact strong privacy regulation, I believe we can be similarly hopeful about the future of privacy. </p><p>Gabriel Weinberg is the chief executive and founder of DuckDuckGo, a search engine and web browser company.</p><p>Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

American citizens are barred until the US controls its COVID-19 outbreak[3], as are citizens from most of the world, including Brazil and Russia, China imposed a sweeping, draconian new security law on Hong Kong. The text of the law is still secret,[4] but it clearly will give China the power to punish and imprison protesters, perhaps even retroactively. Hong Kong democracy activists are already resigning from organizations and erasing social media accounts.The president was briefed on Russian/Taliban bounty killings. According to news reports,[5] his daily briefing in February described the Russian sabotage campaign, but White House officials deny he was told about it.Trump's phone calls with world leaders are \"delusional.\" A devastating CNN article[6] cites Trump's own staffers describing how the President fails to prepare for calls, gets played by Putin and Erdogan, insults Merkel, and endangers US national security.Carl Reiner died at age 98. The comedy legend[7] teamed with Mel Brooks and Sid Caesar, helped create the modern sitcom, directed a bunch of great comic films (including The Jerk), and was a pretty good actor too.VIEWS OF THE DAY Imagine you had a boss like Donald Trump.Imagine your boss did this:You send him a memo about a life-or-death issue for the company, and he doesn't read it. He has regular calls with firms you're doing deals with, but he doesn't prepare for them, and instead spends the whole call talking about himself, or insulting the person he's talking to. He commits an egregious, humiliating screw-up one morning, then turns his phone off and plays golf, leaving everyone else to clean up the mess.These are not hypothetical examples. This is quite literally an account \u2014 taken from a single day! \u2014 of how Donald Trump does the job we hired him to do, and that we pay him to do.In the last 24 hours, we learned that his Presidential Daily Briefing did highlight the shocking Russian murder-for-hire program and the American soldiers killed by it, but the president doesn't read the daily briefing[8]. Even though the briefing summarizes the most important threats facing the United States, the country he runs.In the last 24 hours, we also learned that Trump doesn't prepare for his calls with other world leaders[9], which have enabled them to gull, outfox, and manipulate him. The president, whose primary job is safeguarding national security, is so incompetent that he's viewed as a threat by his own staff. (Oh, and he also spends much of his time on the calls belittling the leaders of America's allies, especially if they're women.)In the last 24 hours, we also learned that the president went dark after retweeting a video of his supporters yelling \"white power.\" He headed off to play golf, and no one could reach him.[10] His own top aides say they could not find the President of the United States for three hours. You're probably not the president of any country, and you probably don't have a security detail, but I bet your colleagues could track you down in less than three hours, even on a Sunday morning.None of these episodes even concerns what Donald Trump does as president. They have nothing to do with the shameful mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. They are just three examples from a single day of how he does his job.We all know what would happen to a boss who behaved like this in any regular workplace. He'd be out in hours, fired by the board and sued by shareholders. \u2014 DPA national \"mask mandate\" could save 5% of GDPEveryone's sick of lockdowns, especially the White House, so it seems unlikely that the Federal government would ever support a national stay-at-home order. And even if the government did issue such an order, it's unlikely that most Americans would comply with it. We had our shot to control and crush the coronavirus with lockdowns, and we flubbed it.But there's a much simpler measure the Federal government could get behind that would make a big difference: A national mandate for Americans to wear masks.According to many studies, ubiquitous mask-wearing radically reduces coronavirus transmission (see, for example, the Goldman Sachs analysis below). Mask wearing also gives people the freedom to resume more of their normal lives, and, therefore, preserves more economic activity.Goldman's economics team estimates that a national mask mandate would significantly increase the percentage of Americans who wear masks.More importantly \u2014 compared to another lockdown of similar effectiveness \u2014 a mask mandate would preserve 5% of GDP.In other words, if only he were able to swallow his pride and order Americans to wear masks, President Trump might be able to singlehandedly boost the US economy. \u2014HBIs Parler \u2014 the conservative-friendly \"free speech\" social media platform \u2014 already banning users?Mainstream conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz and far-right activists such as self-described \"proud Islamophobe[11]\" Laura Loomer have touted the new social media platform Parler as a safe space for right-of-center voices marginalized by the \"techo-fascists[12]\" who run Twitter and Facebook.Parler is supposed to support \"free speech,\" whereas established platforms like Twitter and Facebook supposedly restrict it.But according to TechDirt[13], Parler is already banning some left-of-center users. (I reached out to Parler for comment, but have not heard back yet.)Parler describes itself[14] as a \"non-biased free speech driven entity,\" but also acknowledges that its \"interactions are subject to guidelines; and when you respect them, you are free to participate wholly.\" Its terms of service plainly state that it \"may remove any content and terminate your access to the Services at any time and for any reason or no reason.\" And here's how Parler's CEO described their policies[15] last night in a tweet.That doesn't sound much different than any of the platforms such as Youtube, which caused a stir yesterday by banning some white nationalist and alt-right channels[16].As I've written for Business Insider, there are good reasons to not demand that billionaire tech bros become the arbiters of truth[17] and acceptable discourse. But if Parler's mission is to bring back the wild west of the internet, its own rules appear to be designed to prevent that from happening. \u2014 AF IDEA OF THE DAY Nothing is solved until kids return to school. There are 32 million American households with school-age children, and more than 50 million kids attend US public schools, and we have no plan for them.Recovery remains a pipe dream unless kids go to school. Normal life can't begin until kids go to school. A deservedly scathing column from the New York Times' Michelle Goldberg[18] lays out how we've neglected and botched the most important economic question of the pandemic.Americans are being summoned back to work. Great! But where are their kids supposed to go while they tend bar and install furnaces?School districts are talking about having kids spend a couple of days a week in the classroom \u2014 at most \u2014 to ensure social distancing. They're proposing to rely instead on remote learning, which is a disaster, and steals future economic productivity and happiness from our children. Has there been a crash program to find extra classroom space so kids could go back four days instead? Has there been an emergency appropriation so schools can hire temporary aides and thus reduce classroom sizes? We solve nothing till we solve this, and we're barely trying. \u2014 DP BUSINESS &amp;#38; ECONOMY Uber is in talks to buy Postmates. [19]It failed to buy GrubHub earlier this year, reportedly because of antitrust concerns. Postmates is much smaller and wouldn't attract as much regulator scrutiny. Uber's reportedly bidding $2.6 billion.Coronavirus surge could drag US into an L or W shaped recession. [20]Bank of America says a V-shaped recovery is looking less likely because the pandemic is spreading so wildly. LIFE LeBron wanted to go to the Knicks back in 2010.

THE BIG 3* German officials were so alarmed by Trump's calls with Merkel that they kept them secret[23]. According to CNN's report, Trump spent the calls haranguing the German leader and even called her \"stupid.\"A North Carolina racetrack owner offered a \"Bubba rope\" for sale.

With one eye open, I quickly scrolled through listserv messages, faculty notices, and some junk and then I saw something that made me sit up, open both eyes, and smile: a message with the subject line \"Your Twitter account has been suspended.\"</p><p><br/>For most people, having their account suspended from a social-media platform is not at all funny. Being cut off from Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube can cause <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/651001/getting-banned-from-facebook-can-have-unexpected-and-professionally-devastating-consequences/\">real professional, logistical, and psychological harms</url>: being cut off from business contacts, losing access to third-party sites, becoming unreachable by friends. In a time of quarantine and pandemic, when people are isolated from friends and loved ones for months at a time, access to online communities and conversations is more vital than ever.<br/>But for better or worse, I'm not most users. For the past five years I have researched and written about the rules that govern online speech and how they are enforced. Though most of my research has focused on Facebook-I spent the last year embedded at the company with the team charged with building out a new external-appeals system for just this kind of problem-many of Twitter's rules and policy rationales are similar.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/pandemic-facebook-and-twitter-grab-more-power/610213/?utm_source=feed\">Evelyn Douek: The internet's titans make a power grab</url>]<br/>The tweet that had landed me in social-media jail was one I'd sent the night before. I have been co-hosting a daily live-streamed show with Atlantic contributing writer Benjamin Wittes since the beginning of the pandemic, and our guest last Tuesday night had been the writer Molly Jong-Fast. In the midst of the show, she had had a sotto voce conversation with her spouse, who had reached on camera to try to take a plate away. Jong-Fast had jokingly responded, \"If you take that I will kill you,\" before turning back to the camera and smilingly saying, \"Working at home is a delightful adventure.\" Although her response was funny in the moment, my quotation of it in a tweet didn't exactly capture the humor.<br/>But I wasn't suspended from Twitter for telling a bad joke. Because I'd included the words I will kill you, I was banned for violating Twitter's rules about incitement to violence. In the simple notification I received from the company, I could see a lot that many users probably couldn't. Content that violates the rules of a social-media platform gets flagged in two ways: by other users reporting it or through algorithmic identification. After the recent shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, social-media companies came under intense scrutiny to take down posts and accounts that threatened or called for violence. In such a moment, Twitter can cast a wide net for potential infractions by using algorithms that also generate a large number of false positives-say, by flagging lots of postings that include the word kill.<br/>Once a posting is flagged as potentially problematic speech, a human likely still has to review it-but that human is probably a contract worker at<url normalizedValue=\"https://illusionofvolition.com/behind-the-screen/\">a call center</url>\"type facility outside the United States. That's not necessarily a problem, but what counts as humor, satire, or political protest depends heavily on cultural context. In addition, many such centers have been shut down because of the pandemic, and the number of humans reviewing content has been dramatically reduced-making accurate content moderation even harder.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-and-sheepdog-mentality/615805/?utm_source=feed\">Graeme Wood: Kyle Rittenhouse, Kenosha, and the sheepdog mentality</url>]<br/>So an overly literal and aggressive AI likely flagged my speech, a human likely reviewed it and did not get the humor-understandable-and removed it. In normal times this would have meant just my tweet coming down, but these are not normal times. So my entire account was suspended. Right now, the public-relations cost for Twitter of keeping up an account that might be spreading violent propaganda is very high-and the downside to the company of suspending the average user is very low.<br/>But I am in a better position than most users to potentially make trouble for the company. Not only do I study speech rules for a living, but I also talk to a lot of journalists about content moderation. Because of my professional focus, I also have an unusually high level of access to people at the company. Which is presumably why, less than an hour after suspending my account, the company reinstated it.<br/>Despite all the shininess of new technology, so often getting suspended accounts or deleted posts restored works the good old-fashioned way: via influence, power, connections. It's an unfair system that favors elites and disfavors the average user who doesn't know someone at a technology company, or a government official, or someone with 100,000 followers. And because I disagree with that kind of special treatment, even though I had connections, I was resolved to wait out my appeal-a process that can take up to two weeks.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/twitter-hack-decentralized-internet/614593/?utm_source=feed\">Read: So much for the decentralized internet</url>]<br/>But a screengrab I had sent to a few friends of the suspension email from Twitter quickly made its way to someone internally at Twitter. Another friend tweeted out the image. Many users found the humor in a \"leading expert\" on content moderation being banned for violating content rules and retweeted it. Twenty minutes later, my account was restored.<br/>That's what it's like to be on the sweet side of the curve and have a bunch of privilege. That's also not how speech regulation should happen. By removing old gatekeepers and making self-publication possible, the internet has been a tremendous democratizing force, expanding both the freedom to speak and the potential audience. But not everything has changed. Many features of old-school cronyism and power imbalances have simply been reproduced online, and some problems-bullying, harassment, abuse, hate speech-have been made much worse.<br/>If society is going to try to correct for the bad, we have to simultaneously try to build out the good. Doing this is not easy. Many people offer simplistic, reactionary opinions of and against Big Tech: \"take down more news\" or \"create panels to judge truth\" or \"regulate tech companies\" or \"break tech companies up.\" But these angry talking points don't speak to how any of these policies would work, or how they would solve any problems in the long term. \"I will kill you\" is a threat, and it is a joke. Censorship and authoritarian surveillance are a real threat, and so are conspiracy theories, misinformation, and cult formation. That you cannot attempt to solve the problems on one side of the spectrum without worsening the issues on the other is exactly what makes online-speech regulation a hard problem, and one deserving of more deliberation than you can fit in 280 characters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-whatilearnedtwitterpurgatory616144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-FHV1-DYY9-J008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Below are some of the top stories from the start of the 21st century - and what investors can learn from them:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Central-bank support first saved the global economy, but then encouraged bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What changed in the last 20 years? Central banks steered the global economy through periods of major upheaval - the dot-com bubble, the financial crisis, the euro-zone crisis - by driving down interest rates and pumping greater levels of stimulus into the financial system.</p><p>Central banks have maintained this \"loose\" monetary policy even though economic growth has re-emerged, albeit at a low and slow level. But maybe of more concern, policymakers haven't been able to create enough inflation globally even though prices have soared for equities, real estate and other asset classes. The markets are now all but \"addicted\" to central-bank support.</p><p>What could the future hold? Central bankers feel they have no choice but to keep rates ultra-low or even negative, even though this doesn't leave them much room for maneuver when the next recession or crisis hits. They may need to resort to more unconventional tools, such as adjusting their inflation targets or underwriting large increases in government spending. Moreover, politicians still need to fix the underlying structural issues in economies, including low productivity growth, businesses making bad investment choices and steadily rising overall debt levels.</p><p>Why does it matter for investors? Too much monetary stimulus can jeopardize financial stability.</p><p> When rates are low, risk-taking and debt levels rise, which can cause credit and asset bubbles. And when the economy eventually slows down, companies struggle to maintain their debt burdens and run for cash - which raises the risk of defaults, lowers investment and can even reduce employment. </p><p>If central banks can't fix some of the economy's deeper problems, governments may resort to fiscal stimulus in the form of increased spending or tax cuts. Central banks may be pressured to finance these initiatives by buying up more debt, raising the specter of sovereign default if governments are unable to fulfill their obligations.</p><p>2. Disruptive tech survived the dot-com bubble.</p><p>What changed in the last 20 years? The 1990s dot-com boom went bust in 2000 when investors saw that high stock valuations weren't backed up by profits. But the tech sector survived, and it's prospering today. Mobile computing, e-commerce, cloud computing and social media have transformed how people work and live, and Big Tech companies have become some of the largest corporations in the world.</p><p>What could the future hold? Big Tech firms may become even more powerful unless governments rein in their excesses. Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could transform entire industries, underscoring the need to evolve our educational system to support a high-tech workforce. </p><p>New technologies could expand the \"sharing economy\" (car sharing, holiday rentals, etc.) but also grow the \"gig economy\" as people increasingly turn to online platforms to find employment.\u00a0As more people work on a day-to-day or project-to-project basis with fewer benefits and job protections, we could see inequality increase further.</p><p>Why does it matter to investors? There are many ways in which high-tech disruptors could be disrupted: investors could discover that some firms have spurious valuations, and governments could cramp their business models with new regulations and new \"digital taxes\" on e-commerce revenues. Investors will need to use fundamental research and stay active as they seek to separate the winners from the losers.</p><p>3. Sustainable investing has reached a tipping point.</p><p>What changed in the last 20 years? Sustainable investing has evolved from a trend into an important part of how portfolios should be managed. Investing sustainably means incorporating non-financial inputs - such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors - to seek to generate sustainable outcomes as well as strong financial returns.</p><p>What's behind this shift? Climate change has been a major motivating factor, but sustainability is broader than that. For example, companies that address issues such as executive pay can help improve their competitive positions over the long term.</p><p>What could the future hold? We expect to see voters pressure governments to find real solutions to climate change. We also want to see shareholders and boards encourage management teams to operate their businesses in a more sustainable way. Asset managers will likely continue to drive capital towards sustainable companies and projects that address what investors view as some of the world's biggest challenges.</p><p>Why does it matter to investors? Investors are seeing proof that sustainable investing can help them manage risk and improve return potential, and we believe that interest in this area will continue to grow. </p><p>There are many ways to make sustainable investing a core part of an investment approach: incorporate ESG risk factors into decision-making; focus on sustainable and responsible investing (SRI); align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals; or invest for impact by using capital to address real-world issues. </p><p>Perhaps investors can help jump-start a new \"climate race\" that results in ground-breaking, productivity-boosting innovations - similar to how LEDs and solar cells came out of the 1960s \"space race\".</p><p>- Contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:english@hkej.com\">english@hkej.com</email></p><p>RT/CG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-2371749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y50-MCB1-DXM8-X53B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HONGKONG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TAIWAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics -- never mind political philosophy -- isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions -- that is, the political parties -- that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Donald Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism -- what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals -- mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic -- believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p>Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\"</p><p>If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p>At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer. And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p>Tribune Content Agency</p><p>Jonah Goldberg is an editor-at-large of National Review Online and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ct20 0028 200127 N S 0000000000 00002516</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: In America, politics isn't a big part of most people's lives.

Amazon's portfolio has grown from books and music at its inception to encompass fresh groceries, electronics, neighborhood surveillance, professional services, healthcare, government procurement, internet infrastructure and entertainment - nearly every aspect of life.Amazon sales are expected to hit $238 billion this year, and the company employs 750,000 people, 194,054 of them in tech hubs from Seattle to Atlanta, the report said.The report notes Amazon 'procures products and services from nearly every industry in the four-county region,' with the strongest ties to the real estate, information, shipping, waste management and entertainment sectors, and has received tens of millions in subsidies. Communities in which its warehouses are located, however, have received no sales tax benefits despite the pressures on infrastructure and the environment; rather, the revenue goes to cities in which the merchandise was ordered.The report urges Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour and to adjust it annually to make sure drivers, warehouse and logistics workers are earning a living wage. </p><p>The mean annual wage for Amazon warehouse workers was $20,585 in 2017, roughly half of the living wage for the region, with 14% of warehouse workers living below the U.S. poverty threshold and 31% just above it, the report said. The U.S. poverty line in 2019[2] was $12,490 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four. The Intercept reported[3] Amazon is the biggest employer of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients in five states.'For every $1 in Amazon wages, warehouse workers receive 24 cents in public benefits, averaging $5,245 a year per worker,' the Economic Roundtable report said.Employees outside its warehouse and delivery services earn an average $48,000 to $83,333, with the top salaries going to sales, marketing, management and related professional employees.The report calls on Amazon to provide comprehensive, affordable health insurance for workers and their families, and to provide warehouse workers with adequate breaks and affordable, onsite childcare. Additionally, it calls on Amazon to invest in affordable housing in communities where its facilities are located.Amazon estimates it added more than $4 billion to the Southern California economy in 2018, the report said, disputing the benefits since 'Amazon's thousands of blue-collar workers lack sustainable incomes and require public subsidies to survive.' It notes Amazon paid less than 3% of its $27 billion in profits in federal income taxes.The report adds: 'It's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way. This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits. Amazon will benefit when its workers have living incomes because they will have the buying power to purchase the products it sells.'The report notes the bulk of Amazon sales come from wealthier communities while its warehouses and warehouse and delivery workers are in or from more marginal areas.

It's mysterious, it's all-knowing, it's omnipotent. Except that it's not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> An algorithm is a simple concept that, today, has many complex manifestations. Algorithms' central and opaque position at the heart of social networks like Facebook  cause some to view algorithms in general with a sort of mystical reverence. Algorithms have become synonymous with something highly technical and difficult to understand, that is either an arbiter of objective truth, or, on the other end of the spectrum, something wholly untrustworthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But when people refer to \"the algorithm\" \u2014 whether Facebook's or another tech company's recommendation algorithm, or just \"algorithms\" in general \u2014 do they really know what it means? Judging by how widely  the term is used and misused, most likely not. As Mashable embarks on our exploration of algorithms, we wanted to get something straight right off the bat: What is an algorithm, anyway?</p><p> Mashable spoke with Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington who has also written a book  about the ever-growing role algorithms play in our lives. Before you go being alternatively impressed by or distrusting of the next computer algorithm you encounter, get back to basics on the concept that's powering our world.</p><p> 1. An algorithm is a set of very specific instructions</p><p> How to bake a cake, find the sum of two plus two, or even run a country according to the U.S. Constitution are all examples of algorithms. Why? Because, according to Domingos, the definition of an algorithm is \"a sequence of instructions.\" That's it!</p><p> Today, an algorithm usually refers to \"a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do.\" A computer program is an algorithm, written in a computer programming language, that a computer can understand and execute.</p><p> Algorithms written for computers also have to be extremely precise, often using the instructions \"if,\" \"then,\" and \"else.\" For example, a self-driving car might run on an algorithm for navigating that says \"IF the directions say turn left, THEN turn left.\" See how specific you have to be to make a computer follow a seemingly simple set of instructions?</p><p> In the popular imagination, recommendation algorithms  have come to dominate our idea of what an algorithm is. That is, when many people think about or refer to algorithms, they're referencing something like what TV show Netflix thinks you might like, or which international travelers belong on the no-fly list . While these are extremely complicated algorithms, at their hearts, they're still just a set of instructions a computer follows to complete a specified task.</p><p> \"With computers, the algorithm can get vastly more complex,\" Domingos said. \"Addition is an algorithm that's defined in a few lines of text. Computers can have algorithms that take millions of lines to define.\"</p><p> 2. People wrote and used algorithms long before computers even existed</p><p> As early as the Babylonian era, humans were writing algorithms to help them do the mathematical equations that allowed them to manage their agricultural society.</p><p> \"There were algorithms before computers, because you don't need a computer to execute an algorithm, the algorithm can be executed by a person,\" Domingos said.</p><p> Algorithms using computers first rose to prominence in the mid-20th century, when the military began writing formulas for, say, determining where to aim a missile at a moving object. The concept then moved into business administration, with computers running formulas for administering payroll and such, and in science, for tracking the movements in the sky.</p><p> A turning point for modern algorithms came when Larry Page and Sergei Brin wrote the Google PageRank algorithm . Instead of just relying on information within a page to determine how relevant it was to a search term, the search engine algorithm incorporated a host of other signals that would help it surface the best results. Most notably, how many other links pointed to the article, and how reputable those articles were, based on how many links pointed to those pages, and so on. That was a powerful sign of relevance. And the rest is history.</p><p> WATCH: This is how algorithms work</p><p> 3. Today, you can find algorithms everywhere</p><p> While we might think of algorithms as mathematical equations, algorithms, according to Domingos, \"can compute anything from anything, there might be no numbers involved at all.\" One prominent and extremely complex algorithm is the algorithm that governs the Facebook News Feed . It's an equation that Facebook uses to determine what pieces of content to show its users as they scroll; in other words, a set of instructions to decide what goes on the News Feed.</p><p> \"There's no end of things that Facebook could put on your News Feed but it has to choose.\"</p><p> \"There's no end of things that Facebook could put on your News Feed but it has to choose,\" Domingos said. \"And it's usually a combination of things like how much do you care about the people that produced directly or indirectly that post? How close are they to you in your social network, how relevant it is in its own terms because of the subject, and also how recent.\"</p><p>Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies all rely on algorithms to serve content and products to their customers. But there are also algorithms throughout your life that you might not be aware of.</p><p> For example, Domingos explained that an algorithm governs how your dishwasher knows when it's time to transition from washing to drying, or how your car regulates fuel intake and knows when its tank is full while at the gas station, or how shadows appear in a digitally animated movie to perfectly replicate the sun in the real world.</p><p> \"Clearly, every time you interact with the computer, or you're on the internet, there's algorithms involved,\" Domingos said. \"But these days algorithms are also involved in just about everything.\"</p><p> 4. The most complex algorithms use machine learning</p><p> As we learned, an algorithm typically has to be written in \"excruciating detail\" for a computer to understand what to do. However, that's not the case when the people who write algorithms incorporate machine learning \u2014 a type of artificial intelligence \u2014 which leads to the most sophisticated algorithms.</p><p> \"In traditional programming, a human being has to write down every little detail of what the other has to do, and that is very time consuming, very costly,\" Domingos said. \"Machine learning is the computer discovering its own algorithms instead of being told what to do.\"</p><p> Put another way, machine learning is when a programmer feeds a program some raw data as a starting point, then submits the end point of what an organized, classified version of that data looks like, and leaves it up to the program to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Consider an onion: A human who knows how to cook can turn that onion from a pungent raw sphere into strips of caramelized goodness. In a traditional algorithm, a programmer would write every single step of the cooking instructions. But in an algorithm developed by artificial intelligence, given the end point as a goal, the program would figure out how to get from raw to caramelized itself. Hence, the machine learned.</p><p> These types of algorithms become even more powerful when a human being wouldn't know how to get from point A to point B. For example, a human process like being able to recognize that a cat is a cat takes so much complicated brain power that it would be impossible to write out step by step. But by giving a program a bunch of images of a cat, and images that are not a cat, and showing the desired endpoint as categorizing a cat image as a cat, the computer can learn to execute that process itself.</p><p> \"It's the computer learning to program itself instead of having to be programmed by people.\"</p><p> \"It's the computer learning to program itself instead of having to be programmed by people,\" Domingos said. \"This, of course, is extraordinarily powerful when it works, because now you can, you know, create very powerful, very complex algorithms with very little human intervention.\" It's also very funny when it doesn't work.</p><p> 5. Despite the term's recent cache, algorithms aren't magic</p><p> Thanks to the sheer amount of data algorithms process, it might seem like they're all-knowing mystery boxes built to reveal secrets. However, remember that an algorithm just means a set of instructions. What's more, humans create algorithms, which means they can be flawed.</p><p> \"There's also a lot of misconceptions about algorithms, partly because people don't really see what's going on inside the computer,\" Domingos said. \"A very common one is that people think that algorithms are somehow perfect.\"</p><p> Domingos explained that programmers spend enormous amounts of time fixing mistakes in algorithms so that the lines of code produce the appropriate results. However, humans don't always catch those mistakes. What's more, an algorithm is based around the output a human wants to see, or what that human is optimizing for. Take a hiring algorithm, which ostensibly should find the best candidate for a job. If a human sets the instructions to look at qualifications that aren't necessarily relevant to a job (say, university pedigree), just because the algorithm then says \"candidate A is the best person,\" doesn't make it the truth.</p><p> Often, that's because of bias. And problems with bias can get even worse with algorithms that utilize artificial intelligence.</p><p> \"In traditional programming you have to worry about the biases of the programmer,\" Domingos said. \"In machine learning, mainly, you have to worry about the biases that come from the data.\"</p><p> For example, a hiring algorithm powered by machine learning might use as its starting point a bunch of resumes of candidates, and as its output the resumes of people who were hired in the past. However, most tech companies are not racially diverse. So an automated algorithm that makes hiring recommendations could mirror that real world inequality.</p><p> Studies have shown  that artificial intelligence can mirror the gender and race stereotypes of the humans that train them. In one study, an algorithm that produced word associations used the entirety of the English language on the web as its training data to learn associations between words. Thanks to the biases that exist in our world, the algorithm determined that female names were more associated with the arts, while male names were more associated with math and science. Studies like these show that algorithms are not inherently neutral, perfect, or malevolent: They simply do what the humans and data that train them say to do. In short, they're just as flawed as we are.</p><p> 6. Algorithms are ushering in a technological revolution</p><p> Algorithms may be imperfect, but they are nonetheless transforming our world.</p><p> \"All these things that we take for granted like the web and social media, and on and on, they wouldn't exist without algorithms,\" Domingos said.</p><p> \"Algorithms are doing for mental work what the Industrial Revolution did for manual work.\"</p><p> As these automated sets of instructions become more and more widespread \u2014 from your dishwasher to the government's supercomputers \u2014 humans have the ability to exercise our knowledge more quickly and efficiently than ever before. Domingos views that as nothing short of revolutionary.</p><p> \"Algorithms are doing for mental work what the Industrial Revolution did for manual work,\" Domingos said. \"Algorithms are the automation of intelligence. And if you think about that, this is a very powerful thing: to do something that used to take, you know, human thinking and labor to do, now can be done by an algorithm.\"</p><p> Algorithms are here to stay. But how we design them \u2014 biased or equitable, helpful or harmful \u2014 and how much we unquestionably accept their presence, is up to us.</p><p> Read more from Algorithms:</p><p> *</p><p> Algorithms control your online life.

Business Insider Intelligence Maintaining a patient's medical history on paper can be tedious and labor intensive for healthcare professionals, and with today's consumers wanting quick access to their health data and information without having to physically go to their physicians office, digital solutions are a necessity. Physician burnout costs the US $5 billion each year and triples the likelihood of expensive medical errors - that's why electronic health records (EHRs) have become a staple in the rapidly transforming space. What is an Electronic Health Record? An electronic health record (EHR) is an electronic collection of a patient's medical history - including diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, allergies, laboratory and test results. And EHRs work beyond just recording a patient's health data.  An electronic health record (EHR) is an electronic collection of a patient's medical history.  Tero Vesalainen/ Getty Images EHRs allow patients' health information to be managed in a digital formatand their data can be shared with other providers across multiple organizations. They grant access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make sound decisions and recommendations about a patient's care. EHR vs EMR While some people may use the terms Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) interchangeably, they have stark differences that are important to note.EMRs are sometimes referred to as the first iteration of EHRs - they are quite literally the digital version of a patient's paper chart. EMRs focus on a patient's various diagnoses and treatments and can be used to help track data over time.EHRs can do everything EMRs can do, and more. Designed to go beyond the information stored and entered by the original health organization, they cover a much wider scope of documentation and analysis of a patient's health and medical history. They can even assist with healthcare management functions, such as billing and scheduling. Benefits of EHR Systems EHR systems can improve two major areas in the healthcare industry: physician productivity and patient satisfaction.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://i.insider.com/5bfc0ff01011420d58762dc3\">https://i.insider.com/5bfc0ff01011420d58762dc3</url> EHRs can improve physician productivity and patient satisfaction.  Business Insider Intelligence Physician productivity EHR implementation has the ability to speed up physician diagnoses and digitize administrative tasks, which are associated with 30% of healthcare costs. Other ways EHRs can enhance physician productivity include: Fewer file pullsReduced transcription costs24/7 access to patient informationImproved billing and schedulingPatient Satisfaction Today's patients want to have a firmer grasp on monitoring and controlling their own health data and medical records. EHRs give them the ability to quickly obtain their data and see which areas of their health history require improvement. Additionally, EHRs provide patients with: 24/7 access to their recordsEasier chronic disease managementReduced turn-around time for messages to a physicianImproved delivery of education materialsEHR Implementation Strategies &amp;#38; Challenges While EHRs have the potential to decrease cost, increase productivity, and enhance patient satisfaction, EHR implementation is a long and complicated process. Some of the major hurdles EHRs face include interoperability and data privacy.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://i.insider.com/5e82002d2d654f65990e761b\">https://i.insider.com/5e82002d2d654f65990e761b</url> Just 37% of US hospital leaders think their organization is successful at sharing medical data with other health systems.  Business Insider Intelligence Interoperability - the ability of different software systems to share and exchange data - is one of the biggest challenges faced by the entire healthcare industry. And since one of the key perks to using EHRs is the ability to share patients' medical history across a variety of health organizations, accurate interoperability of data is critical. However, just 37%[2] of US hospital leaders think their organization is \"very\" or \"extremely\" successful at sharing medical data with other health systems, according to Business Insider Intelligence's Digital Health Ecosystem[3] report.Along with Interoperability, data security and consumer privacy pose another obstacle when it comes to EHR implementation. Patients and physicians want to ensure that their data is being protected - a challenging feat when faced with potential cyber attacks and security breaches.Employee training is also important to a successful EHR implementation strategy. Hospitals and healthcare companies should form a strong, focused EHR team to think about what software the organization will need, how they'll migrate paper documents to a digitized format, and what strategies will be put in place if their EHR program goes down.Clinicians should not be trained on one specific function of an EHR, but on the entire system so that they can best optimize what the digital tool can offer both themselves and patients. It's important for employees to be trained in the entire EHR module, otherwise they risk reverting back to traditional methods. Government EHR Incentive Program &amp;#38; Mandates To help tackle the various challenges discussed above, the Centers for Medicare &amp;#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Promoting Interoperability Programs[4] designed to assist healthcare professionals and organizations to meaningfully use EHR technology.The program initially launched in 2011 and evolved through three stages: Stage 1: set the foundational requirements for recording patient health data electronicallyStage 2: CMS encouraged healthcare professionals to use EHRs to exchange patients' health data and emphasized the importance of quality improvement and meaningful useStage 3: Consolidates and combines stage 1 and 2, providing physicians with the current requirements for the Promoting Interoperability Programs. Many points were carried over from stage 2, emphasizing the importance of quality of care and working to improve patients' health outcomes.Digital Health Trends &amp;#38; Future of EHR The global Electronic Health Records Market size[5] was valued at $20.55 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach $33.41 billion by 2025. And big tech firms are largely contributing to this growth as they continue to make their way into the digital health market.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://i.insider.com/5cd03d52021b4c4c047d1d63\">https://i.insider.com/5cd03d52021b4c4c047d1d63</url> EHRs and digital health tools are more important now than ever before.  Business Insider Intelligence Google parent Alphabet is leveraging its cloud platform to solve healthcare technology issues associated with EHR interoperability, and in turn score fruitful health system partnerships. In 2018 Google launched Google Cloud for Healthcare with the aim of helping clinicians collect and access patients' health data.The Cloud Healthcare API[6] enables easy exchange between healthcare applications while meeting industry-specific privacy and security requirements to propel EHRs to become meaningful decision support tools.In 2019 Apple also decided to tap into the EHR opportunity - the tech company signed a deal to integrate Allscripts' EHR data into its Apple Health Records platform. And since Allscripts is the fifth largest EHR vendor in the US[7] according to Business Insider Intelligence, this tie-up will likely help Apple increase its hospital penetration.Amazon is making its way into the EHR market as well. Amazon Web Services (AWS) collects data from sources like EHRs to aid healthcare providers in their decision making process and identify and predict potential risks to patients. According to research from Business Insider Intelligence, 62% of healthcare organizations view a potential move by Amazon as positive for the medical industry.Finally, many big tech players in transportation and patient convenience will support the EHR market moving forward. Uber began taking advantage of the untapped opportunity with nonemergency medical transport by allowing provider organizations using Cerner EHRs to request[8] Uber rides for their patients. Want to learn more? Amid social distancing restrictions and the worry associated with entering a healthcare facility for nonemergencies, digital health is more important now than ever before. Personalization and convenience is becoming a staple for almost every organization, and to accomplish this in the healthcare industry, digital technology is a must-have.Business Insider Intelligence's Digital Health Ecosystem research report explores the current healthcare ecosystem, the key trends driving digital transformation, and what consumers can expect to see in the future.Interested in getting the full report?

Many banks dismissed the idea back then as 'the regulator wouldn't allow it'. Then the regulator did allow it in some countries, but banks were confused about the regulatory position. For example, if they use cloud services for customer data and the provider gets breached, who is liable. </p><p>As a result, they still resisted moving anything of importance to the cloud. Today, it is still confused for some. When can you use cloud, when can't you use cloud? To be honest, cloud has come a long way in ten years, from originally just being about Software-as-a-Service to anything as-a-service. Even Banking-as-a-Service! Banks have moved maybe 20 percent of their operation to private cloud, and these are typically hardware, infrastructure and non-customer related operations like payroll. Customer data is still housed within the bank, and often locked away in aging core systems that are inflexible and costly to maintain. The problem with that is that it is the customer data that is the bank's most valuable asset. If a bank can rationalise and leverage customer data for intelligent marketing and service, then that's where the future competitive battleground will be. After all, most banks worry about the technology giants moving into financial services and what all the big tech firms do well is leverage data. Yet banks, with decades of history of customer data locked into legacy systems, are loathed to move this data as they might fall foul of regulators. This has to change. What I find interesting here is that the majority of banks that are doing digital well, truly understand that they need data analytics on enterprise customer data stores and are doing this through private cloud services. They are placing customer data into these cloud systems on-premise in many instances, as they are aware that some regulatory requirements demand customer data is held within national borders. Nevertheless, they are placing customer data in the cloud. I've even met some banks that are pushing the boundaries to move 80 percent of their operations to cloud. Why? Because it gives them total flexibility to move with demands of the customers and of the business. I guess it is similar to my own personal use of cloud. To begin with, I was wary. Will the cloud provider look at my data? Or, even worse, lose my data? Today, I feel confident that I can place my data in the cloud and pick up the information I need, whenever I need it, regardless of location. And that is part of the beauty of a cloud-based information business. The data - customer or employee - is available to whoever needs it, whenever they need it, wherever they need it. In addition, it overcomes issues of staffers who take data home because it's on their laptop. Surely, that's more insecure than storing data in the cloud and secured by the bank? The banks that understand this model are now creating interesting hybrid structures of private and public cloud services for their infrastructure, operations, software and data, that is driven by the regulatory model and central bank oversight.

The answer lies in an October 2019 dinner at the White House</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:dateline><location>New Delhi, 2020-07-07 15:06:02</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> July 07 -- On 20 November last year, NBC News broke the news that Mark Zuckerberg, Donald Trump and a Facebook board member, Peter Thiel, had dined together at the White House the previous month. \"It is unclear why the meeting was not made public or what Trump, Zuckerberg and Thiel discussed,\" the report said.</p><p><br/>That was it.Nothing else has emerged since.Not the date, not who arranged the menu, the venue, the seating, not the full guest list.And not whether some kind of deal got done between two of the most powerful men in the world.<br/>The news cycle moved on, and the dinner became one of the unsolved mysteries of American power.<br/>But I was able to pry some of those details loose last week from White House officials along with current and former senior Facebook employees and people they speak to. Most said they would only talk on the condition their names not be used, since the company is not eager to call attention to Zuckerberg's relationship with the president.<br/>Their accounts painted a picture of an unusual gathering - something in between a high-stakes State dinner between the leaders of uneasily allied superpowers and the awkward rehearsal dinner before a marriage that has both families a little rattled.<br/>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, pulled together the dinner on 22 October on short notice after he learned that Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, would be in Washington for a cryptocurrency hearing on Capitol Hill, a person familiar with the planning said. The dinner, the person said, took place in the Blue Room on the first floor of the White House. The guest list included Thiel, a Trump supporter, and his husband, Matt Danzeisen; Melania Trump; Kushner; and Ivanka Trump. The president, a person who has spoken to Zuckerberg said, did most of the talking. The atmosphere was convivial, another person who got an account of the dinner said. Trump likes billionaires and likes people who are useful to him, and Zuckerberg right now is both.<br/>But looming over the private dinner is a question: Did Trump and Zuckerberg reach some kind of accommodation? Zuckerberg needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies. Trump needs access to Facebook's advertising platform and its viral power.<br/>Both men are getting what they want, and it's fair to wonder whether this is a mere alignment of interests or something more.<br/>\"I believe they have a deal,\" said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor who is now a fierce critic, who added that it was \"probably implied rather than explicit.\"<br/>\"Mark's deal with Trump is highly utilitarian,\" he said. \"It's basically about getting free rein and protection from regulation. Trump needs Facebook's thumb on the scale to win this election.\"<br/>Jesse Lehrich, the co-founder of Accountable Tech, a new nonprofit group pushing Facebook to tighten controls on its platform, suggested that the two men have a tacit nonaggression pact. \"Trump can rage at Big Tech and Mark can say he's disgusted by Trump's posts, but at the end of the day the status quo serves both of their interests,\" Lehrich said.<br/>Officials at Facebook and in the administration scoff at the notion that there is some kind of secret pact. And it's hard to imagine that anyone - certainly not Zuckerberg - would be dumb enough to make a secret deal with a president known for keeping neither secrets nor deals.<br/>Trump and Zuckerberg had met just once before the dinner, an Oval Office encounter last September. Afterwards, the president boasted about his giant following on the platform. But October was a hot political month at Facebook: Zuckerberg was in an open battle with a leading Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was threatening to break up Facebook and whom he called \"an existential threat\" to the company. The morning of their dinner, a top British official demanded answers on why Facebook would tolerate false political advertising.<br/>Zuckerberg, a Facebook executive said, seems to view Trump as a peer. By contrast, he told amused top aides at one of his regular Monday meetings in March that Kushner was calling him so often about help with the administration's coronavirus response that he couldn't keep up, two people familiar with the meeting said. (\"Mark does not think of himself as a peer to this president or any president,\" a Facebook spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said, adding that Zuckerberg had initiated the conversation with Kushner about the coronavirus response.)<br/>Zuckerberg has played the high-stakes and unpredictable politics of the Trump years as well as any other corporate executive. And a week before the dinner last October, he made clear in a speech that his interests and the president's aligned: Zuckerberg would reject a growing movement to limit the false or inflammatory statements of the American president.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\" he said in the address at Georgetown University on 17 October. \"We don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\"<br/>Trump, for his part, has been notably softer on Facebook than on Amazon, Google, Twitter or Netflix at a moment when his regulatory apparatus often focuses on the political enemies he identifies in tweets.<br/>Still Facebook, like other tech giants, finds itself in a political bind: Democrats hate and distrust them because they spread right-wing misinformation and helped elect Donald Trump; Republicans hate and distrust them because they're run by California liberals and delete some right-wing speech. But Facebook has avoided that trap deftly over the last three and a half years, by moving faster and more earnestly than its competitors to mollify conservatives.<br/>Facebook has always had a keener ear to the Right side of Washington than much of Silicon Valley, directed in part by Joel Kaplan, a Zuckerberg friend and former Bush administration official who is Facebook's vice-president of global public policy. But it began focusing intently on winning over the conservative media in the spring of 2016, when Gizmodo alleged that the content moderation on the short-lived Trending Topics product on Facebook \"suppressed conservative news.\" A right-wing apparatus that had spent decades claiming bias in the media turned its sights on the tech giant. And Zuckerberg gave them the response they'd always hoped for - he shut down the product, welcomed his critics to meetings and signalled that he shared their concerns.<br/>The next year, Trump continued to push the norms of truth and civility, and the social media platforms began reckoning with their broader misinformation and harassment problem. That set him on an inevitable - and to his supporters, welcome - collision course with the new gatekeepers. Trump's dependence on Facebook as an advertising vehicle - he spent $44 million on the platform in 2016, and is expected to far exceed that this year - means that he needs the company as much as it needs him. And, as Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, and Cecilia Kang reported in May, Zuckerberg increasingly embodies his company.<br/>So Zuckerberg's warm relationship with the president and his family is a victory for the company's internal policy team led by Kaplan. But the company, people involved in its political strategy say, has been having an internal debate over balancing the reality of Republican control of regulatory agencies with the fact that Democrats are far more likely, in the long run, to actually push through new oversight or try to break up the company by forcing the sale of Instagram or WhatsApp. The balance, in the Trump years, has shifted right. Sheryl Sandberg, a leading Democrat and Zuckerberg's powerful deputy, has seen her connections with Democrats fray as the company defies them and her power in the company fades as well.<br/>Trump's administration has reciprocated. The Justice Department is currently conducting antitrust investigations of the tech giants. But while Google and Amazon face \"mature investigations,\" the Facebook inquiry is \"not real at all,\" a person who has been briefed on the investigation said. And Facebook has acted like a company with no worries in Washington. It has continued to acquire companies, as Isaac reported last week, and moved to allow users to send messages between Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - a merging of the services that could further fuel monopoly concerns. (Facebook's view is that it's far less dominant in any market than the other big tech companies and has less to worry about than Google or Amazon.)<br/>The summer of 2020 is one of those moments when corporate Washington starts to panic. What had looked like deft Trump-era politics now looks like exposure and risk. Top Democrats, including Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi - who was infuriated when a distorted video of her went viral - have singled out Facebook as a bad actor. Trump is, at the moment, viewed by Washington's insider class as likely to lose in November, though Biden poses less of a threat to Facebook than Warren would have.<br/>While executives across Facebook insist that Zuckerberg's position on free speech on the platform is a matter of long-term planning and principle, not political expediency, his political team also recognizes that they are badly out of position for a Democratic administration. And in recent days, Facebook has been eager to show its independence from the White House. The company has been unhesitatingly enforcing existing policy against Trump's posts, and has been quick to point it out to the media, as it did last Thursday, when a Trump ad used a symbol associated with Nazi Germany.<br/>Zuckerberg has not budged, however, on his core insistence that Trump should be able to say what he wants on the platform, and most of what he wants in ads - including false statements, as long as they aren't misleading on specific, narrow topics, like the census. But he did reportedly tell Trump that he objected, personally, to Trump's warning that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" And he and Chan wrote to scientists funded by their non-profit organisation that they were \"deeply shaken and disgusted by [Trump's] divisive and incendiary rhetoric.\"<br/>Those gestures may have appeased Facebook's workforce, but they've gone largely unnoticed in Washington.<br/>\"All the big companies tacked to the right after Trump won, and Facebook probably moved farther than the others,\" said Nu Wexler, a Democrat who worked in policy communications for Facebook in Washington. \"But the politics of tech are changing, and companies should be worried about Democrats as well. The days of just keeping the president happy are over.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1170297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609C-XFY1-DYDW-7017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Everything You Need to Know About Europe's New Data Law</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MilwaukeeWI: American Society for Quality has issued the following press release:   A revolution in how companies handle your personal information is happening.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect across the European Union on May 25, introducing much tougher rules on data privacy.  Here is what you need to know:  What is it?  GDPR is the European Union\u2019s new data privacy law. </p><p> It gives people more control over their personal data and forces companies to make sure the way they collect, process and store data is safe.  The EU hopes to achieve a fundamental change in the way companies think about data\u2014its central idea is \u201cprivacy by default.\u201d  Who is affected?  Any organization that holds or uses data on people inside the European Union is subject to the new rules, regardless of where is it based.  Companies may not have any direct relationship with Europe and still be subject to the new laws\u2014for example if they support businesses that have customers inside the EU.  A call center handling customer services for companies that sell products in Europe or a website tracking browsing histories will be impacted.  The cost of complying with the regulation is huge. The International Association of Privacy Professionals and EY estimated that Fortune Global 500 companies spent roughly $7.8 billion to prepare for the new rules.  What do I have to do?  Deal with those emails flooding your inbox. Many companies will have reached out to customers by Friday, asking for consent to keep your personal details.  Scores of firms, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, have also changed their privacy settings in recent weeks in preparation for the new rules. WhatsApp has changed its minimum user age in Europe to 16 from 13.  You will need to agree to the new policies and confirm your age to continue using many services. Children under 16 will need parental consent in most European countries.  Can companies still collect data?  Yes. But only if they can prove that they have a \u201clawful basis\u201d for doing so.  That could be because they have a contract or legal obligation that allows them to do that.  They can also simply obtain an individual\u2019s consent in order to store and process personal data. Such requests must be clear and written in plain language\u2014no more hiding of consents in general terms and conditions.  They could also be processing data to perform tasks that are in the public interest\u2014such as the police collecting information about suspected criminals.  Or they might need to collect personal data to protect someone\u2019s life. For example, a hospital will be able to access the personal details of an unconscious patient with life-threatening injuries without having to ask for consent.  What do companies have to do?  Businesses will have to pay a lot more attention to the security of personal data, and they won\u2019t be allowed to hold onto it for longer than is necessary.  Anyone can ask for their personal information to be deleted from a company\u2019s servers. There are only a few exceptions\u2014for example, for law enforcement purposes or if the service the customer wants cannot be provided without the data.  Business will also be required to tell authorities about any data security breach within 72 hours of discovering it\u2014a rule that should eliminate big gaps between the business finding out and customers being informed.  They may also have to prove they are handling data correctly. This might mean increased monitoring and documentation. Some may have to hire data protection officers.  Why is all this happening?  GDPR seeks to expand and update rules that have been in place since 1995, and unify a patchwork of different laws into one piece of legislation.  The European Union said the new rules are necessary to protect consumers in an era of huge cyberattacks and data leaks.  What if companies fail to comply?  They face big financial penalties.  European regulators can fine companies up to 4% of annual global sales, which for the big tech firms could run into billions of dollars. Penalties for smaller firms would be capped at \u20ac20 million ($23.5 million).

Investors are looking past the pandemic, for a variety of reasons, which we explain below. (Want this delivered to your inbox each day? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">Sign up here</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u2018This market is nuts\u2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;amp;P 500 is 0.1 percent higher than it was six months ago, setting a record at the close of trading yesterday. That doesn\u2019t seem so momentous \u2014 until you consider what happened in between: The blue-chip index shed a third of its value in the early stages of the pandemic and then roared back, soaring more than 50 percent from its low in late March.</p><p>What gives? A new market record may seem strange when set against the human and economic devastation of the pandemic. (Or as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">one analyst put it</url>: \u201cThis market is nuts.\u201d). As Andrew explains in a guest appearance in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">The Morning</url>, our sister newsletter, there are five major considerations that investors are making to justify the rally:</p><p>1\\xB8\\x8F\u20e3 Looking past bad news today and anticipating better conditions 12 to 18 months from now</p><p>2\\xB8\\x8F\u20e3 The continued good fortunes of a few big tech companies</p><p>3\\xB8\\x8F\u20e3 An almighty market pop that would arise from news of a vaccine breakthrough</p><p>4\\xB8\\x8F\u20e3 An accommodating Fed printing money and keeping rates low</p><p>5\\xB8\\x8F\u20e3 The hope that Congress overcomes its divisions and pumps the economy with more stimulus</p><p>Can it last? \u201cMarkets often operate as something of an experiment in mass psychology,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">The Times\u2019s Matt Phillips writes</url>. So what could dampen the mood?</p><p> The market is very top-heavy, with just five companies \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 accounting for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">more than a fifth</url> of the S&amp;amp;P 500\u2019s market value. Those tech giants have gained around 40 percent so far this year, while the 495 other stocks in the index have collectively lost a few percentage points.</p><p> Another potentially ominous sign comes from company insiders, who have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">selling their holdings</url> in greater numbers. The data platform AlphaSense sifted through regulatory filings for DealBook and found that disclosures of executive stock sales so far this month have already surpassed last month\u2019s total, and are on track to beat the record set in February, when the market set its previous high.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New Jersey, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London. </p><p>And we are thrilled to introduce <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">Lauren Hirsch</url>, who joins DealBook this week as a reporter in New York. Welcome, Lauren!</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Here\u2019s what is happening</p><p>In case there was any doubt, Joe Biden has been confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee. He was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">formally nominated</url> by the party last night at the party\u2019s national convention. Also onscreen: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">Former President Bill Clinton</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">Jill Biden</url> rejected President Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">highlighted progressive priorities</url> in her cameo appearance, and other Democrats focused on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">improving health care</url>. Tonight\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">agenda</url> includes Senator Elizabeth Warren (more on her below), former President Barack Obama and Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate.</p><p>Cost-cutting measures at the Postal Service were put on hold. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced that operational changes, which drew criticism for causing mail delays and for potentially affecting voting by mail, would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">now take place</url> after the November elections.</p><p>A Senate panel found extensive links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">nearly 1,000-page report</url> concluding that some Trump advisers maintained extensive contacts with Russian intelligence officials who sought to disrupt the 2016 election.</p><p>The shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk raised profit expectations. The world\u2019s biggest container company not only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">reinstated full-year financial guidance</url>, but pegged it above pre-pandemic levels, a sign that international trade may not be as bad as feared (provided there isn\u2019t a second wave of the virus, the company noted). The Danish company\u2019s shares jumped more than 7 percent in early trading today.</p><p>C.E.O. pay reached a seven-year high. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that leaders of the 350 largest American companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">earned an average of $21.3 million</url> last year, setting the ratio of C.E.O.-to-worker pay at 320-to-1. Rising stock markets could propel executives\u2019 pay to similarly high levels again this year, despite pandemic-inspired cuts to salaries, which tend to be a small proportion of C.E.O.\u2019s stock and option-based pay packages.</p><p>Wall Street isn\u2019t out of the woods yet with Warren</p><p>Elizabeth Warren is set to take the virtual stage at the Democratic National Convention tonight, a week after Wall Street <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">sighed in relief</url> when Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential running mate instead of the longtime critic of the financial industry. But here\u2019s the thing \u2026</p><p>Ms. Warren\u2019s ability to influence a Biden administration may be stronger now than if she were to become vice president, where she would be more directly limited by the wants of her boss. And while progressive Democrats <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">have rallied behind Ms. Harris</url>, they\u2019ll likely expect something in return. That may mean giving Ms. Warren a spot in the administration, making her speech tonight a showcase \u2014 or a tryout, of sorts \u2014 of the ideas and approach that she would promote during a Biden presidency.</p><p>Could she be the next Treasury secretary? It would be a natural fit for the senator, who has made financial regulation a priority (although she is seen as a long shot). If named to the role, Ms. Warren would emphasize Main Street over Wall Street, push for higher taxes on the wealthy and promote spending over fiscal restraint, experts say. But even if she isn\u2019t nominated for the role, Mr. Biden would probably turn to her for advice, especially on priorities for the S.E.C. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">the agency she helped create</url>. \u201cShe understands financial regulation as a tool to bring about better outcomes,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a law professor at Duke and a former deputy secretary at the Treasury Department.</p><p>But even Ms. Warren\u2019s allies worry that her regulatory zeal could backfire. \u201cThe financial institutions are very negative about her,\u201d the former representative Barney Frank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">told CNN</url> last month. \u201cIf you have someone who is that much opposed by the people being regulated, it doesn\u2019t work smoothly.\u201d (Mr. Frank, a co-author of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, is now a director at Signature Bank.) He suggested that he\u2019d prefer Ms. Warren stay in the Senate, where she has been a prominent advocate of progressive causes. Indeed, Democrats may not want to give up Ms. Warren\u2019s seat in the Senate, depending on the balance of power in the chamber.</p><p>There are other jobs a Biden administration could offer her, like attorney general, where she would oversee investigations into the market power of big technology companies, or a bespoke position like a regulatory czar. But first, of course, there\u2019s the small matter of whether Mr. Biden can win the election in November.</p><p>SPACs are so hot right now</p><p>Another day, another flurry of news about so-called special-purpose acquisition companies, the publicly traded M.&amp;amp;A. machines that are Wall Street\u2019s hot new craze. (How hot? These \u201cblank check\u201d firms have raised more than $30 billion so far this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">according to SPAC Research</url>, compared with $13.6 billion in all of 2019.)</p><p>Another electric vehicle maker went public by merging with a SPAC. Canoo, which sells van-like vehicles that require a subscription, announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">plans to merge</url> with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV to gain a stock listing. It\u2019s the fourth electric vehicle company to pursue this route, after Nikola, Lordstown Motors and Fisker.</p><p>More SPACs have been founded, featuring some prominent names:</p><p> Starboard Value, the activist hedge fund, announced plans to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">raise $300 million</url>, following in the footsteps of Bill Ackman and Dan Loeb.</p><p> Bill Foley, a longtime financier with plenty of experience with SPACs, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">raised $1.3 billion</url>, increasing the size of the deal by $100 million.</p><p> And Kevin Hartz, the co-founder of Eventbrite, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">raised $200 million</url> for a new SPAC to buy a tech start-up.</p><p>Mr. Hartz explained to DealBook the thinking behind his SPAC, and how he\u2019s dealing with the competition. Consumer internet companies, marketplaces and fintech start-ups are on his radar, and the fund\u2019s smaller size allows it to target younger companies with founders that he wants to take a bet on, much like the traditional venture model. Indeed, he is banking on his relationships with venture funds and start-up founders around Silicon Valley to stand out in an increasingly crowded field. (In addition to founding Eventbrite, Mr. Hartz was an early investor in Airbnb and Uber.)</p><p> What, in his mind, is driving the SPAC boom? Strong equity markets are helping SPAC deals get done quickly despite pandemic-imposed travel restrictions. \u201cWe had our first org meeting with Goldman Sachs on June 18 \u2014 we retained our lawyer then \u2014 and 60 days later we\u2019re now a public entity in the market ready to go,\u201d Mr. Hartz told Lauren Hirsch, our new DealBook reporter.</p><p>How to spend it</p><p>As lockdowns ease, where people are opening their wallets shows how the pandemic is reshaping spending habits. Check out this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">series of infographics assembled by The Times</url> using location-tracking data from smartphones for state- and store-level details of shopping activity.</p><p>The revenge of brick-and-mortar retailers. In-store shopping is still (mostly) down from pre-pandemic times, forcing retailers with physical locations to up their online game. For some, that has paid off handsomely: Target reported its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">strongest sales growth in history</url> this morning, propelled by digital sales that nearly tripled in its most recent quarter. That followed Walmart\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">blowout earnings yesterday</url>, in which its U.S. online sales doubled.</p><p> New nationwide e-commerce data also reflects this trend, with retailers that sell online as well as in store (Walmart and Target) growing faster than their online-only counterparts (Amazon). As of June, online-only retailers accounted for 55 percent of overall e-commerce sales in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.</p><p>Look out ahead. Walmart executives said that government stimulus was the main \u201ctailwind\u201d driving the jump in sales: They mentioned \u201cstimulus\u201d 13 times on their call with analysts yesterday. Keeping up that red-hot sales streak might depend on lawmakers negotiating a new round of unemployment insurance and support measures, which is shaping up to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\">less generous than before</url>. \u201cAs stimulus funds tapered off toward the end of the quarter, sales started to normalize,\u201d Brett Biggs, Walmart\u2019s C.F.O., said on the call.</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p> ViacomCBS is reportedly in talks to sell CNET, a tech news site, to Red Ventures for about $500 million.

Distancing itself from recent size-and-scale questions, Google will reportedly not sell the data of customers who start new checking accounts.'If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, it's good for the internet and good for us,' said Caesar Sengupta, Google's VP of product management.The Wall Street Journal reported that \"Google will leave the financial plumbing and compliance to the banks.\"Google follows in the footsteps of Apple, Amazon, and others in their plans to enter finance. </p><p>Apple recently launched its own credit card, known simply as the 'Apple Card[2].' Last year, Amazon was said to be in talks with J.P. Morgan about creating its own checking account.

Thanks to the invention of smartphones followed by numerous applications that made our lives easier. For example, the procedure for withdrawing money or transferring money to different accounts was tiring until the online payment system was launched. Speaking of the vast development and growth opportunities to pay from different online platforms, Google is up to something big. Google Smart Debit Card or Google Pay Card Though the news is unclear and not declared officially, Google is planning to launch a debit card probably named \u201cGoogle Smart Debit Card or Google Pay Card\u201d. The exact name of the product hasn''t been revealed yet.</p><p><br/>Leaked Google Card Image.<br/>Image Credit: TechCrunch.com Using this debit card, users will be able to pay through mobile phone, offline stores, and online as well. For the time being, Google has partnered with CITI and Stanford Federal Credit Union to avail of this new service to the customers. The company is developing this product for both online and offline purposes.Though testing of the prototype is still on the run, the product is anticipated to launch soon. Design of Google Smart Debit Card Google smart debit card or Google Pay Card (Anticipated names) is expected to have diverse applications and immense transparency. Since Google hasn''t officially declared anything, confusion prevails. But, as per a recent TechCrunch article, the product is expected to release soon. Further, TechCrunch also claims to have found an image of the same from highly placed sources within the company. Based on various sources, the following features can be listed: Card Makers Most probably, the smart debit card will have the name of Google and partnered bank imprinted on it. Google is using a chip card on the Visa network this time tough it can support other card companies like Mastercard. Security Feature The user might have to use a fingerprint and PIN for security purposes while paying through the app (probably Google Pay). Payment methodology For offline purposes, the user can just hold it up to a card reader and it is done. Google is also expected to allow Bluetooth mobile payments for its new card.<br/>Leaked Google transaction Image.<br/>Image Credit: TechCrunch.com Card Details Another interesting feature of this smart card is that it will have a virtual card number that can be used for online payment or payments through the app. This number will be different from the one imprinted on your Google smart debit card. Extension of Google Pay There is also confusion if this debit card will be an extension of the Google Pay app or it is a different product altogether? Currently, users can pay only via the online mode from Google Pay and it only allows peer-to-peer payments. So, a smart debit card linked to the app will be very advantageous for this product of Google's. Security and Transparency of Google Card Transaction Tracing Every online platform secures a detailed history of past transactions. But, Google will also store the locations in the app where you have used the card. This will help in identifying faulty payments that can be traced and confirmed with the respective store. Stealing and Hacking of Card If your card gets stolen, you can ask for a replacement while continuing to shop using the online card number. And, if you think your online card number was hacked, you can simply reset it.This dual advantage will help the users immensely to carry out hassle-free transactions. The amount of transparency that will be provided is comparatively wider than any other company. But, the question still lies in the degree of freedom that will be given to the customers for accessing the company's data. Launch of Apple Pay and Apple Card But, the idea of a card connecting to a super powerful app is not rolling out in the market for the first time. Last August, Apple launched Apple Card which can be used to make payments via Apple Pay. The company partnered with Goldman Sachs and offered a titanium Mastercard credit card to the customers.<br/>Apple Pay<br/>Image Credit: Apple.com In a short span of 7-8 months, Apple card has managed to have 5% of the global card transactions carried out through Apple Pay.The big tech pundits of the day predict Google Card has a rival to the payment ecosystem of Apple. The only probable difference between the two is the fact that Google Card will be a debit card while Apple card is a credit card.<br/>Apple Card<br/>Image Credit: Apple.com Recovering after COVID-19 In the beginning, the partnered banks will supervise the credit infrastructure and proper regulation of policies. And, Google will buy this time to build an undoubtedly excellent user interface for its customers. So, it can be predicted that Google is planning to launch the new product anytime soon.Moreover, the pandemic of COVID-19 has caused financial tension among every individual and big company as well. So, launching a product like a debit card which is backed by the strong security system of Google, can lower the tension among common citizens. This might be a big hit for Google if it launches the product at the right time. Conclusion Google has already created an outstanding reputation with its search engine, advertising, and mapping products. The company is dominant if spoken of limitless data access, excellent engineering, and overflowing fund. So, if Google wants to make a significant presence in financial services, it might bloom equally. Starting with the debit card, it may offer banking, stoke brokerage, insurance, etc in the future.The post What is Google Smart Debit Card? appeared first on TechnologyReviews24 .MENAFN3004202000704256ID1100097214</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100097214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSX-NPX1-F04Y-T2HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00035TS</classCode><className>STANFORD FEDERAL CREDIT UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post via Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first article in a series.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've been involved in the wild world of conspiracy theories for 24 years now, ever since I published my first article in the pages of Paranoia Magazine in the spring of 1996 when I was 24 years old. What most impressed me about Paranoia was the anarchy of information available within its pages. It wasn't a right-wing conspiracy magazine. It wasn't a left-wing conspiracy magazine. It didn't even exist <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">between</emphasis> these two poles. Its editorial mission (or non-mission) was beholden to values (or non-values) that lay far beyond these limiting parameters, a dedication to cataloging and analyzing the extremes of fringe beliefs from multiple points of view. As Marshall McLuhan once said, \"A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.\" The editors of Paranoia dedicated themselves to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> having a point of view. It was the exact opposite of propaganda. By its very nature, propaganda excludes any information that contradicts or undermines the message the dedicated propagandist is intent on disseminating.</p><p>Conspiracy theories have always been used by what we now call \"persuasion engineers\" as tools of mass indoctrination. A good conspiracy theory that seems plausible and frightening enough can be worth more than a thousand well-reasoned stump speeches.</p><p>In my first book, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2464/9781936296408\">Cryptoscatology: Conspiracy Theory as Art Form</url>,\" I broke conspiracy theories down into five distinct categories: 1) Insanity, 2) Disinformation, 3) Misinformation, 4) Satire, and 5) Legitimate Research. Some theories manage to merge two or more categories into one. Only on very rare occasions do such theories manage to combine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis>five categories. The most recent - and arguably most impactful - strain of this hybrid form of conspiracy-mongering first emerged in 2017, promulgated by an anonymous 4chan poster known only as \"Q\" - or \"QAnon.\" You've been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/13/is-qanon-the-new-christian-right-with-evangelicals-fading-a-new-insanity-rises/\">hearing a lot about this lately</url>, most likely. At least one QAnon supporter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/12/trump-says-qanon-supporter-condemned-by-gop-leaders-for-racist-videos-is-future-republican-star/\">is almost certain to be elected to Congress</url> in November, and devotees of this particular conspiracy theory are eagerly supporting the re-election of Donald Trump. </p><p>The average person, who has <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> spent the past couple of decades studying the origins of conspiracy theories (a reasonable choice, I might add), would probably not recognize the origins of most of the quasi-surreal elements that make up the convoluted QAnon narrative.</p><p>Earlier this year, in March, I was talking to a friend about COVID-19 and the national lockdown. He's 10 years older than me and lives in a small town in the Midwest. I live in Long Beach, California. While chatting with him on the phone about all the unexpected difficulties that have arisen from teaching my English classes online, he suddenly volunteered the opinion that COVID-19 would be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">positive</emphasis>development in 2020. </p><p>\"Yeah?\" I asked. \"How so?\" </p><p>He proceeded to tell me, with complete sincerity, that after Trump is re-elected in 2020, he will deliver \"free energy\" to the people of America. Not only that, he's also going to abolish the income tax. Right now, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at this very moment</emphasis>, United States troops have been deployed underground where they're busy \"cleaning out\" covert subterranean tunnels, \"saving hundreds of children from satanic slaves,\" and kicking out the \"black hats.\" Without skipping a beat, my friend then insisted that news of this game-changing development would be \"coming out\" soon. </p><p>\"It's a great thing,\" he told me in measured tones. \"Trump will have to use the Emergency Broadcast System to give this news to the American people because the media keeps lying and social media like Twitter and YouTube are censoring and deleting videos that report reality the way it actually is.\" </p><p>Furthermore, my friend said in tones of absolute certainty, Trump supporters working behind the scenes (referred to by my friend as the \"white hats\") had recently wrested control of the entire Google corporation from devil worshippers, which is why you could now retrieve \"accurate information\" from that particular search engine. </p><p>\"Uh ... where are you getting all this?\" I asked.</p><p>He seemed reluctant to tell me. At first he hemmed and hawed, then muttered, \"Oh ... just these message boards.\" </p><p>\"Well ... what message boards?\" He wouldn't say. \"Could you send me the links?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis> no links,\" he replied.</p><p>\"No links? What is this, the dark web or something?\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Kind of.\"</p><p>When I pushed further and asked for more details about this \"accurate information,\" in a conspiratorial whisper he urged me to search the word \"Adrenochrome\" in Google.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">* * *</emphasis></p><p>I first read Hunter S. Thompson's classic nonfiction book, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" when I was 18. I've taught the book in my English composition classes at Cal State Long Beach, off and on, since 2002. I'm well aware that Thompson's alter ego, Raoul Duke, encounters Adrenochrome when Dr. Gonzo (Duke's speed-fueled attorney) suggests that he ingest the drug because it \"makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.\" He also warns Duke, \"You'll go completely crazy if you take too much.\" Duke claims that the hallucinogenic effects of Adrenochrome work best when the substance is harvested from the adrenaline glands of living human bodies. </p><p>Even at the tender age of 18, I knew that this inspired idea was one of Thompson's many phantasmagorical asides in an otherwise journalistic narrative. Thompson was famous for these detours into Munchausen-level jabberwocky, like the time he claimed that Sen. Ed Muskie was taking \"massive doses\" of a psychedelic drug called Ibogaine during the 1972 presidential campaign, a hilarious (and entirely false) tale related in Thompson's \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.\" </p><p>On the commentary track that accompanies the 2003 Criterion DVD release of Terry Gilliam's film adaptation of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" Gilliam confirms that Adrenochrome is \"a totally invented nonsense-drug that Hunter [made up].\" Gilliam follows this with an eerily prescient statement that almost foreshadows the introduction of the drug into QAnon's ever-expanding mythology: \"This scene had such an effect on so many people that afterwards I was hearing kids say, 'Oh, I've had Adrenochrome!' They were talking about where they get it. 'Oh, there's a guy who can get me Adrenochrome.' I just love how the Big Lie always works. It worked for Hitler, and it can work for people like us [i.e., artists and storytellers].\" </p><p>It appears to be working for QAnon as well, since \"totally invented nonsense\" has a way of becoming facts in the minds of the gullible, the semi-informed, the frustrated and the insane.</p><p>So I did exactly as my friend suggested. I googled the word \"Adrenochrome.\" Keep in mind that my friend insisted that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had taken control of Google, so I would receive only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">accurate</emphasis> information from that search engine when inputting this particular word.</p><p>The first result that popped up was Emily Writes' March 17, 2020, article in Spinoff entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/17-03-2020/emily-writes-down-the-rabbit-hole-with-the-covid-19-conspiracy-theorists/\">Down the Rabbit Hole With the COVID-19 Conspiracy Theorists</url>,\" which begins as follows:</p><p>Today I fell down a rabbit hole of rabid Trump supporters who are convinced COVID-19 is both a hoax and also Trump's greatest moment as president. He has acted decisively apparently, while also knowing that COVID-19 is a Hollywood Liberal Elite cover-up .... <url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/07-04-2020/explainer-adrenochrome-the-drug-that-doesnt-exist/\">Adrenochrome</url> is a drug for the liberal elite of Hollywood made from actual human brain stem containing hormones from the adrenal gland. Hillary Clinton manufactures this drug by torturing children in a pizza shop .... Tom Hanks is addicted to Adrenochrome and he caught COVID-19 from the latest batch of tainted Adrenochrome that came through Celine Dion who is a high priestess from the Church of Satan. She is well-versed in poison as she's been lacing her children's clothing line with a chemical that makes our children \"gender neutral.\" Tom Hanks signalled to the Hollywood Liberal Elite Cabal DeepState in his Golden Globes acceptance speech that there would be a shortage of Adrenochrome. Ellen has closed her studio audience because she's addicted as well. </p><p>After reading this article in its entirety, I emailed my friend and pointed out that when I put his advice to the test and Googled \"Adrenochrome,\" the first article that popped up sardonically tore the entire conspiracy theory to shreds. How did this jibe with the notion that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had total control over Google?</p><p>I received no direct answer to this question. I was told, instead, to search the name \"Rachel Chandler.\" This would somehow answer <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> my questions. Bypassing those pesky \"white hats\" at Google, I decided to use a different search engine called Millionshort, and almost immediately found a March 22, 2019, Daily Dot article entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-rachel-chandler/\">QAnon Is Attacking a Random Woman in a Disturbing and Dangerous Way</url>,\" which detailed how QAnon posts had become strangely focused on a photographer and casting director named Rachel Chandler, who is part of the newspaper-owning Chandler family but has no visible political footprint and is not otherwise a public figure:</p><p>Q made a seemingly endless stream of posts referencing Chandler, insinuating that she took a 2017 picture of Bill Clinton and registered child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (whose light prison sentence handed down by current Trump cabinet official Alexander Acosta is currently under investigation) hanging out together in a pool.</p><p>Beyond that, QAnon accused Chandler of \"procuring\" \"girls\" for Epstein, having her photography studio funded by elite Satanists who used it for rituals, flaunting Epstein's \"sex and torture room victims\" with her pictures, having a link to a still-unexplained (yet supposedly horrific) event at the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood ....</p><p>To be clear, Chandler has not been accused of any wrongdoing by any law enforcement agency .... There's no evidence she took the pool picture that QAnon claims proves she's linked to Epstein, and it doesn't even feature him - though it does feature George Nader, the convicted pedophile who's providing evidence in the Mueller investigation regarding President Donald Trump's link to meetings with Russian officials.</p><p>And yet Chandler's name has been dragged into the conspiracy so completely that the first page of a Google search shows nothing but QAnon-related content, while five of the top six videos that come up when searching her name are by QAnon acolytes.</p><p>None of the many videos and speculations posted by QAnon and his numerous supporters provide any definitive links between Chandler and Jeffrey Epstein, yet somehow this red herring has received intense focus from thousands of amateur detectives, most of whom no doubt have a sincere desire to get to \"the truth.\" </p><p>One might argue, as does Emily Writes in her above-mentioned Spinoff article, that when \"people feel like they have no control over their lives - like in the midst of a global pandemic - the comforting certainty of conspiracy theories seems increasingly attractive.\" One might also argue that racism, xenophobia and (perhaps most deadly of all) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">neophobia</emphasis> fuel the interest in such theories. But I think these explanations, while partially valid, ignore the heart-meat core of the real issue plaguing America at this moment.</p><p>The real problem is that genuine conspiracies are unfolding before our eyes every day, but when the mainstream media avoids reporting on such conspiracies - for a whole variety of reasons, the main one being that it's simply easier to get paid rewriting corporate press releases and slapping one's byline on the end product than by actually putting one's reputation on the line tackling a plethora of inconvenient truths - it becomes necessary for average people to fill in the gaps on their own. These people may be ignorant, but they're not stupid. They know instinctively that they're being victimized by blatant lies every day. So, with no training whatsoever, they perform \"research\" on their own by scouring through a multiplicity of such \"reliable\" online sources as 4chan, 8chan, 8kun and Reddit.</p><p>As award-winning science fiction writer <url normalizedValue=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/\">Cory Doctorow wrote in May</url> of this year:</p><p>[W]hy is it so easy to find people who want to believe in conspiracies[?] My answer: because so many of the things that have traumatized so many people ARE conspiracies.</p><p>The opioid epidemic was a conspiracy between rich families like the Sacklers and regulators who rotate in and out of industry. The 737 crisis was caused by Boeing's conspiracy to cut corners and aviation regulators' conspiracy to allow aerospace to regulate itself.</p><p>Senators conspire to liquidate their positions ahead of coronavirus lockdown, well-heeled multinationals conspire to get 94.5% of the \"small business\" PPP fund, Big Tech conspires to fix wages with illegal collusion while fast food franchises do the same with noncompetes.</p><p>In a world of constant real conspiracy scandals that destroy lives and the planet, conspiracy theories take on real explanatory power. </p><p>Everything Doctorow says here is true; however, we rarely apply such clinical observations to people we know <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personally</emphasis>. Often, we use such explanations to dismiss the cockeyed beliefs of peculiar strangers encountered online. Before March of this year, I had known my friend to be a rational person with a fair amount of real-world experience and common sense, not someone who would be swayed easily by illogical rhetoric or over-the-top nonsense. On the other hand, I hadn't been in close contact with him since the last presidential election and the birth of QAnon, who emerged from internet obscurity in November of 2017.  This was, coincidentally, the same time period when Trump's approval ratings had reached a \"near-record low.\" (The full effect of QAnon on Trump's approval ratings since November of 2017 has not been studied in any substantial way.) </p><p>After about four weeks had passed, I emailed my friend and asked him a few more questions about QAnon, trying to understand how anyone could believe so many unsubstantiated claims with so little skepticism. Surely, I thought, there must be something at least halfway reasonable to back up these outrageous statements. I needed to know the source so I could evaluate the claims myself. On May 3, I sent him the following email:</p><p>I'm trying to wrap my head around this whole QAnon thing, so maybe you can help me. I have a few questions.</p><p>Why would the United States military be \"cleaning out\" covert underground bases when they're the ones who <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">built</emphasis>the bases in the first place? Who else but the U.S. military would be in charge of massive underground bases built on U.S. soil? </p><p>Why would Trump be interested in implementing free energy? Isn't he trying to revive the coal industry? It would seem to me that free energy would undermine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> of his business interests.</p><p>According to most reliable sources, censorship on Google seems to be alive and well at the moment, which is nothing new. (In my experience, I've found that millionshort.com is a far better search engine tool.) </p><p>I'm not certain that \"white hats\" exist in our current political situation. Perhaps \"black hats,\" \"slightly-less-black hats,\" and \"gray hats\" would be more accurate terms?</p><p>Didn't the whole concept of \"Adrenochrome\" being harvested from live human beings originate with Hunter S. Thompson - as a satirical concept? I always thought that passage in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was intended as a joke. Is QAnon claiming that Hunter S. Thompson had \"insider knowledge\" when he wrote the book?</p><p>The next day, my friend responded to my questions with another question: \"You're a researcher. Why are you playing D.U.M.B.?\" That's it. Nothing else.</p><p>Since I had no idea why he had written the word \"dumb\" as an acronym, I replied, \"I'm not playing 'D.U.M.B.' I honestly don't know the answers to those questions. I'm trying to understand the proposed scenario. If you have the answers, I'd love to hear them.\"</p><p>Later that day, he wrote me back and explained that \"D.U.M.B.\" stood for \"Deep Underground Military Bases.\" The explanation rendered the first message even more confusing than before. (How could I possibly be playing \"Deep Underground Military Bases\"? I resisted the urge to ask him to elucidate further, as I suspected the response would just add to my befuddlement.) He sent me several links as well, despite the fact that a month earlier he had insisted that there <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were no links</emphasis> he could possibly send me. He never bothered to explain how or why this situation had changed during the past four weeks. </p><p>Inevitably, the first link led me to QAnon's posts. Most of these posts were so cryptic, they didn't answer any of my questions. </p><p>Addressing my question about Trump delivering free energy to the American people, my friend responded, \"President Trump's uncle John was asked by the F.B.I. to investigate Nikola Tesla's papers.\" This terse sentence was then followed by a link to an Aug. 2, 2017, post at Heavy.com entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/john-trump-donald-uncle-mit-nikola-tesla-g-george-time-travel/\">John Trump, Donald's Uncle: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know</url>.\" Right after the link, my friend wrote, \"And you wonder where I come up with free energy for the nation in the future.\" </p><p>Nothingin the Heavy.com post suggested that Donald Trump was working on delivering free energy to the United States during his second term in office. </p><p>Attempting to address one of my other questions, he wrote, \"If Google's censorship is on, then why, when you search 'Rachel Chandler,' you get all of this information about her?\" </p><p>Of course this is a perfect example of \"circular reasoning.\" Everything QAnon says about Rachel Chandler is true because, when you Google \"Rachel Chandler,\" all of QAnon's posts pop up. Therefore, everything QAnon said about Rachel Chandler is true. (If A, then B. If B, then A. Or perhaps I should say, \"If Q, then Q. If Q, then Q.\")</p><p>To answer my other questions, he sent me links to three different YouTube videos, one of which dealt with the untold story of the Deep Underground Military Bases. </p><p>The first video (entitled \"The Underground War, Happening Now\") features a \"Christian Patriot\" named \"Rick B2T\" in conversation with an anonymous fellow calling himself \"Gene.\" I subjected myself to 38 minutes and 16 seconds of unsubstantiated rumors about U.S. Christian soldiers battling demon-worshipping members of the Illuminati in deep underground bases. </p><p>This directed me to an even more convoluted YouTube video entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V3Ew130Gug\">1 of 2 - Best of 'Underground War Details! Part 8' - Gene Decode - B2T Show</url>,\" in which I learned that Gene had decided to risk his life going public with these dangerous secrets because, one fateful day, God had contacted Gene and expressly told him, \"This information <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">has</emphasis> to come out!\" At this point, Gene teamed up with an anonymous former \"Canadian military officer\" to reveal the disturbing truths about these \"Deep Underground Military Bases\" where (and this is a direct quote) \"animal and human sacrifices nourish the bowels of creatures - in other words, we're talking demonic, terrible <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">things</emphasis> that inhabited Earth long before Man arrived.\" </p><p>After this startling revelation, Gene elaborated on the scenario further: \"The New World Order is in the final stages - that is, they <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were</emphasis>, until Trump came along - the final stages of their satanic plan to reduce the current world population by 80 to 90 percent [...]. If it weren't for Trump, most of us would not be listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anything</emphasis> right now.\" [Gene chuckles darkly.] \"Instead of the Word of Christ, you'd be listening to the angels.\"</p><p>As of May 28, only 10 days after being posted, this video had already received 33,105 views and only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">34</emphasis> dislikes. I've seen YouTube videos of random kids opening birthday presents get more dislikes than that. The Blessed to Teach YouTube channel has 92,600 subscribers. </p><p>If it's not clear to you yet, let me spell this out: Even as you're reading these words, there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thousands</emphasis> of \"Christian Patriots\" living in the United States who sincerely believe that Donald Trump <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">saved them from being eaten by demons</emphasis> when he entered the White House. This is not hyperbole. This is a literal interpretation of what they believe. </p><p>This is the mentality you're dealing with. No amount of logic, common sense or reason can combat such convoluted delusions. These people are clearly the product of incessant brainwashing, and yet they think <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">everyone else</emphasis> in the country is mind-controlled to such an extreme degree that people who do not support Trump are either A) soulless demon-worshippers or B) poor unfortunates incapable of understanding the obvious truths being unveiled by geniuses like \"Rick B2T\" and his pal \"Gene.\" On Nov. 18, 1978, hundreds of \"True Believers\" in Guyana held similar beliefs, only seconds before they literally drank the Kool-Aid.</p><p>You might assume that most of Rick's viewers are hardcore evangelicals dwelling in a deep pit in the Ozarks. But my friend wasn't raised a hardcore Christian and had never expressed such views in my presence over the course of many, many years. Something happened to change him radically between the emergence of QAnon in 2017 and the advent of the national lockdown in 2020. Even a regular Joe can be swayed by nonsense with a fair amount of ease.</p><p>Nonsense has always been an essential part of the American landscape, from Salem witch hunts in the 1690s to New Age UFO cults in the 1990s, but QAnon takes this tradition of nonsense to a whole new level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next installment</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The roots of QAnon: From 1940s science fiction to 19th-century anti-Masonic propaganda</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1597668588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-0YH1-DYTP-R2HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post via Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first article in a series.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've been involved in the wild world of conspiracy theories for 24 years now, ever since I published my first article in the pages of Paranoia Magazine in the spring of 1996 when I was 24 years old. What most impressed me about Paranoia was the anarchy of information available within its pages. It wasn't a right-wing conspiracy magazine. It wasn't a left-wing conspiracy magazine. It didn't even exist <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">between</emphasis> these two poles. Its editorial mission (or non-mission) was beholden to values (or non-values) that lay far beyond these limiting parameters, a dedication to cataloging and analyzing the extremes of fringe beliefs from multiple points of view. As Marshall McLuhan once said, \"A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.\" The editors of Paranoia dedicated themselves to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> having a point of view. It was the exact opposite of propaganda. By its very nature, propaganda excludes any information that contradicts or undermines the message the dedicated propagandist is intent on disseminating.</p><p>Conspiracy theories have always been used by what we now call \"persuasion engineers\" as tools of mass indoctrination. A good conspiracy theory that seems plausible and frightening enough can be worth more than a thousand well-reasoned stump speeches.</p><p>In my first book, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2464/9781936296408\">Cryptoscatology: Conspiracy Theory as Art Form</url>,\" I broke conspiracy theories down into five distinct categories: 1) Insanity, 2) Disinformation, 3) Misinformation, 4) Satire, and 5) Legitimate Research. Some theories manage to merge two or more categories into one. Only on very rare occasions do such theories manage to combine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis>five categories. The most recent - and arguably most impactful - strain of this hybrid form of conspiracy-mongering first emerged in 2017, promulgated by an anonymous 4chan poster known only as \"Q\" - or \"QAnon.\" You've been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/13/is-qanon-the-new-christian-right-with-evangelicals-fading-a-new-insanity-rises/\">hearing a lot about this lately</url>, most likely. At least one QAnon supporter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/12/trump-says-qanon-supporter-condemned-by-gop-leaders-for-racist-videos-is-future-republican-star/\">is almost certain to be elected to Congress</url> in November, and devotees of this particular conspiracy theory are eagerly supporting the re-election of Donald Trump. </p><p>The average person, who has <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> spent the past couple of decades studying the origins of conspiracy theories (a reasonable choice, I might add), would probably not recognize the origins of most of the quasi-surreal elements that make up the convoluted QAnon narrative.</p><p>Earlier this year, in March, I was talking to a friend about COVID-19 and the national lockdown. He's 10 years older than me and lives in a small town in the Midwest. I live in Long Beach, California. While chatting with him on the phone about all the unexpected difficulties that have arisen from teaching my English classes online, he suddenly volunteered the opinion that COVID-19 would be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">positive</emphasis>development in 2020. </p><p>\"Yeah?\" I asked. \"How so?\" </p><p>He proceeded to tell me, with complete sincerity, that after Trump is re-elected in 2020, he will deliver \"free energy\" to the people of America. Not only that, he's also going to abolish the income tax. Right now, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at this very moment</emphasis>, United States troops have been deployed underground where they're busy \"cleaning out\" covert subterranean tunnels, \"saving hundreds of children from satanic slaves,\" and kicking out the \"black hats.\" Without skipping a beat, my friend then insisted that news of this game-changing development would be \"coming out\" soon. </p><p>\"It's a great thing,\" he told me in measured tones. \"Trump will have to use the Emergency Broadcast System to give this news to the American people because the media keeps lying and social media like Twitter and YouTube are censoring and deleting videos that report reality the way it actually is.\" </p><p>Furthermore, my friend said in tones of absolute certainty, Trump supporters working behind the scenes (referred to by my friend as the \"white hats\") had recently wrested control of the entire Google corporation from devil worshippers, which is why you could now retrieve \"accurate information\" from that particular search engine. </p><p>\"Uh ... where are you getting all this?\" I asked.</p><p>He seemed reluctant to tell me. At first he hemmed and hawed, then muttered, \"Oh ... just these message boards.\" </p><p>\"Well ... what message boards?\" He wouldn't say. \"Could you send me the links?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis> no links,\" he replied.</p><p>\"No links? What is this, the dark web or something?\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Kind of.\"</p><p>When I pushed further and asked for more details about this \"accurate information,\" in a conspiratorial whisper he urged me to search the word \"Adrenochrome\" in Google.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">* * *</emphasis></p><p>I first read Hunter S. Thompson's classic nonfiction book, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" when I was 18. I've taught the book in my English composition classes at Cal State Long Beach, off and on, since 2002. I'm well aware that Thompson's alter ego, Raoul Duke, encounters Adrenochrome when Dr. Gonzo (Duke's speed-fueled attorney) suggests that he ingest the drug because it \"makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.\" He also warns Duke, \"You'll go completely crazy if you take too much.\" Duke claims that the hallucinogenic effects of Adrenochrome work best when the substance is harvested from the adrenaline glands of living human bodies. </p><p>Even at the tender age of 18, I knew that this inspired idea was one of Thompson's many phantasmagorical asides in an otherwise journalistic narrative. Thompson was famous for these detours into Munchausen-level jabberwocky, like the time he claimed that Sen. Ed Muskie was taking \"massive doses\" of a psychedelic drug called Ibogaine during the 1972 presidential campaign, a hilarious (and entirely false) tale related in Thompson's \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.\" </p><p>On the commentary track that accompanies the 2003 Criterion DVD release of Terry Gilliam's film adaptation of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" Gilliam confirms that Adrenochrome is \"a totally invented nonsense-drug that Hunter [made up].\" Gilliam follows this with an eerily prescient statement that almost foreshadows the introduction of the drug into QAnon's ever-expanding mythology: \"This scene had such an effect on so many people that afterwards I was hearing kids say, 'Oh, I've had Adrenochrome!' They were talking about where they get it. 'Oh, there's a guy who can get me Adrenochrome.' I just love how the Big Lie always works. It worked for Hitler, and it can work for people like us [i.e., artists and storytellers].\" </p><p>It appears to be working for QAnon as well, since \"totally invented nonsense\" has a way of becoming facts in the minds of the gullible, the semi-informed, the frustrated and the insane.</p><p>So I did exactly as my friend suggested. I googled the word \"Adrenochrome.\" Keep in mind that my friend insisted that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had taken control of Google, so I would receive only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">accurate</emphasis> information from that search engine when inputting this particular word.</p><p>The first result that popped up was Emily Writes' March 17, 2020, article in Spinoff entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/17-03-2020/emily-writes-down-the-rabbit-hole-with-the-covid-19-conspiracy-theorists/\">Down the Rabbit Hole With the COVID-19 Conspiracy Theorists</url>,\" which begins as follows:</p><p>Today I fell down a rabbit hole of rabid Trump supporters who are convinced COVID-19 is both a hoax and also Trump's greatest moment as president. He has acted decisively apparently, while also knowing that COVID-19 is a Hollywood Liberal Elite cover-up .... <url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/07-04-2020/explainer-adrenochrome-the-drug-that-doesnt-exist/\">Adrenochrome</url> is a drug for the liberal elite of Hollywood made from actual human brain stem containing hormones from the adrenal gland. Hillary Clinton manufactures this drug by torturing children in a pizza shop .... Tom Hanks is addicted to Adrenochrome and he caught COVID-19 from the latest batch of tainted Adrenochrome that came through Celine Dion who is a high priestess from the Church of Satan. She is well-versed in poison as she's been lacing her children's clothing line with a chemical that makes our children \"gender neutral.\" Tom Hanks signalled to the Hollywood Liberal Elite Cabal DeepState in his Golden Globes acceptance speech that there would be a shortage of Adrenochrome. Ellen has closed her studio audience because she's addicted as well. </p><p>After reading this article in its entirety, I emailed my friend and pointed out that when I put his advice to the test and Googled \"Adrenochrome,\" the first article that popped up sardonically tore the entire conspiracy theory to shreds. How did this jibe with the notion that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had total control over Google?</p><p>I received no direct answer to this question. I was told, instead, to search the name \"Rachel Chandler.\" This would somehow answer <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> my questions. Bypassing those pesky \"white hats\" at Google, I decided to use a different search engine called Millionshort, and almost immediately found a March 22, 2019, Daily Dot article entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-rachel-chandler/\">QAnon Is Attacking a Random Woman in a Disturbing and Dangerous Way</url>,\" which detailed how QAnon posts had become strangely focused on a photographer and casting director named Rachel Chandler, who is part of the newspaper-owning Chandler family but has no visible political footprint and is not otherwise a public figure:</p><p>Q made a seemingly endless stream of posts referencing Chandler, insinuating that she took a 2017 picture of Bill Clinton and registered child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (whose light prison sentence handed down by current Trump cabinet official Alexander Acosta is currently under investigation) hanging out together in a pool.</p><p>Beyond that, QAnon accused Chandler of \"procuring\" \"girls\" for Epstein, having her photography studio funded by elite Satanists who used it for rituals, flaunting Epstein's \"sex and torture room victims\" with her pictures, having a link to a still-unexplained (yet supposedly horrific) event at the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood ....</p><p>To be clear, Chandler has not been accused of any wrongdoing by any law enforcement agency .... There's no evidence she took the pool picture that QAnon claims proves she's linked to Epstein, and it doesn't even feature him - though it does feature George Nader, the convicted pedophile who's providing evidence in the Mueller investigation regarding President Donald Trump's link to meetings with Russian officials.</p><p>And yet Chandler's name has been dragged into the conspiracy so completely that the first page of a Google search shows nothing but QAnon-related content, while five of the top six videos that come up when searching her name are by QAnon acolytes.</p><p>None of the many videos and speculations posted by QAnon and his numerous supporters provide any definitive links between Chandler and Jeffrey Epstein, yet somehow this red herring has received intense focus from thousands of amateur detectives, most of whom no doubt have a sincere desire to get to \"the truth.\" </p><p>One might argue, as does Emily Writes in her above-mentioned Spinoff article, that when \"people feel like they have no control over their lives - like in the midst of a global pandemic - the comforting certainty of conspiracy theories seems increasingly attractive.\" One might also argue that racism, xenophobia and (perhaps most deadly of all) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">neophobia</emphasis> fuel the interest in such theories. But I think these explanations, while partially valid, ignore the heart-meat core of the real issue plaguing America at this moment.</p><p>The real problem is that genuine conspiracies are unfolding before our eyes every day, but when the mainstream media avoids reporting on such conspiracies - for a whole variety of reasons, the main one being that it's simply easier to get paid rewriting corporate press releases and slapping one's byline on the end product than by actually putting one's reputation on the line tackling a plethora of inconvenient truths - it becomes necessary for average people to fill in the gaps on their own. These people may be ignorant, but they're not stupid. They know instinctively that they're being victimized by blatant lies every day. So, with no training whatsoever, they perform \"research\" on their own by scouring through a multiplicity of such \"reliable\" online sources as 4chan, 8chan, 8kun and Reddit.</p><p>As award-winning science fiction writer <url normalizedValue=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/\">Cory Doctorow wrote in May</url> of this year:</p><p>[W]hy is it so easy to find people who want to believe in conspiracies[?] My answer: because so many of the things that have traumatized so many people ARE conspiracies.</p><p>The opioid epidemic was a conspiracy between rich families like the Sacklers and regulators who rotate in and out of industry. The 737 crisis was caused by Boeing's conspiracy to cut corners and aviation regulators' conspiracy to allow aerospace to regulate itself.</p><p>Senators conspire to liquidate their positions ahead of coronavirus lockdown, well-heeled multinationals conspire to get 94.5% of the \"small business\" PPP fund, Big Tech conspires to fix wages with illegal collusion while fast food franchises do the same with noncompetes.</p><p>In a world of constant real conspiracy scandals that destroy lives and the planet, conspiracy theories take on real explanatory power. </p><p>Everything Doctorow says here is true; however, we rarely apply such clinical observations to people we know <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personally</emphasis>. Often, we use such explanations to dismiss the cockeyed beliefs of peculiar strangers encountered online. Before March of this year, I had known my friend to be a rational person with a fair amount of real-world experience and common sense, not someone who would be swayed easily by illogical rhetoric or over-the-top nonsense. On the other hand, I hadn't been in close contact with him since the last presidential election and the birth of QAnon, who emerged from internet obscurity in November of 2017.  This was, coincidentally, the same time period when Trump's approval ratings had reached a \"near-record low.\" (The full effect of QAnon on Trump's approval ratings since November of 2017 has not been studied in any substantial way.) </p><p>After about four weeks had passed, I emailed my friend and asked him a few more questions about QAnon, trying to understand how anyone could believe so many unsubstantiated claims with so little skepticism. Surely, I thought, there must be something at least halfway reasonable to back up these outrageous statements. I needed to know the source so I could evaluate the claims myself. On May 3, I sent him the following email:</p><p>I'm trying to wrap my head around this whole QAnon thing, so maybe you can help me. I have a few questions.</p><p>Why would the United States military be \"cleaning out\" covert underground bases when they're the ones who <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">built</emphasis>the bases in the first place? Who else but the U.S. military would be in charge of massive underground bases built on U.S. soil? </p><p>Why would Trump be interested in implementing free energy? Isn't he trying to revive the coal industry? It would seem to me that free energy would undermine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> of his business interests.</p><p>According to most reliable sources, censorship on Google seems to be alive and well at the moment, which is nothing new. (In my experience, I've found that millionshort.com is a far better search engine tool.) </p><p>I'm not certain that \"white hats\" exist in our current political situation. Perhaps \"black hats,\" \"slightly-less-black hats,\" and \"gray hats\" would be more accurate terms?</p><p>Didn't the whole concept of \"Adrenochrome\" being harvested from live human beings originate with Hunter S. Thompson - as a satirical concept? I always thought that passage in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was intended as a joke. Is QAnon claiming that Hunter S. Thompson had \"insider knowledge\" when he wrote the book?</p><p>The next day, my friend responded to my questions with another question: \"You're a researcher. Why are you playing D.U.M.B.?\" That's it. Nothing else.</p><p>Since I had no idea why he had written the word \"dumb\" as an acronym, I replied, \"I'm not playing 'D.U.M.B.' I honestly don't know the answers to those questions. I'm trying to understand the proposed scenario. If you have the answers, I'd love to hear them.\"</p><p>Later that day, he wrote me back and explained that \"D.U.M.B.\" stood for \"Deep Underground Military Bases.\" The explanation rendered the first message even more confusing than before. (How could I possibly be playing \"Deep Underground Military Bases\"? I resisted the urge to ask him to elucidate further, as I suspected the response would just add to my befuddlement.) He sent me several links as well, despite the fact that a month earlier he had insisted that there <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were no links</emphasis> he could possibly send me. He never bothered to explain how or why this situation had changed during the past four weeks. </p><p>Inevitably, the first link led me to QAnon's posts. Most of these posts were so cryptic, they didn't answer any of my questions. </p><p>Addressing my question about Trump delivering free energy to the American people, my friend responded, \"President Trump's uncle John was asked by the F.B.I. to investigate Nikola Tesla's papers.\" This terse sentence was then followed by a link to an Aug. 2, 2017, post at Heavy.com entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/john-trump-donald-uncle-mit-nikola-tesla-g-george-time-travel/\">John Trump, Donald's Uncle: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know</url>.\" Right after the link, my friend wrote, \"And you wonder where I come up with free energy for the nation in the future.\" </p><p>Nothingin the Heavy.com post suggested that Donald Trump was working on delivering free energy to the United States during his second term in office. </p><p>Attempting to address one of my other questions, he wrote, \"If Google's censorship is on, then why, when you search 'Rachel Chandler,' you get all of this information about her?\" </p><p>Of course this is a perfect example of \"circular reasoning.\" Everything QAnon says about Rachel Chandler is true because, when you Google \"Rachel Chandler,\" all of QAnon's posts pop up. Therefore, everything QAnon said about Rachel Chandler is true. (If A, then B. If B, then A. Or perhaps I should say, \"If Q, then Q. If Q, then Q.\")</p><p>To answer my other questions, he sent me links to three different YouTube videos, one of which dealt with the untold story of the Deep Underground Military Bases. </p><p>The first video (entitled \"The Underground War, Happening Now\") features a \"Christian Patriot\" named \"Rick B2T\" in conversation with an anonymous fellow calling himself \"Gene.\" I subjected myself to 38 minutes and 16 seconds of unsubstantiated rumors about U.S. Christian soldiers battling demon-worshipping members of the Illuminati in deep underground bases. </p><p>This directed me to an even more convoluted YouTube video entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY8Nfzcn1qQ\">1 of 2 - Best of 'Underground War Details! Part 8' - Gene Decode - B2T Show</url>,\" in which I learned that Gene had decided to risk his life going public with these dangerous secrets because, one fateful day, God had contacted Gene and expressly told him, \"This information <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">has</emphasis> to come out!\" At this point, Gene teamed up with an anonymous former \"Canadian military officer\" to reveal the disturbing truths about these \"Deep Underground Military Bases\" where (and this is a direct quote) \"animal and human sacrifices nourish the bowels of creatures - in other words, we're talking demonic, terrible <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">things</emphasis> that inhabited Earth long before Man arrived.\" </p><p>After this startling revelation, Gene elaborated on the scenario further: \"The New World Order is in the final stages - that is, they <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were</emphasis>, until Trump came along - the final stages of their satanic plan to reduce the current world population by 80 to 90 percent [...]. If it weren't for Trump, most of us would not be listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anything</emphasis> right now.\" [Gene chuckles darkly.] \"Instead of the Word of Christ, you'd be listening to the angels.\"</p><p>As of May 28, only 10 days after being posted, this video had already received 33,105 views and only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">34</emphasis> dislikes. I've seen YouTube videos of random kids opening birthday presents get more dislikes than that. The Blessed to Teach YouTube channel has 92,600 subscribers. </p><p>If it's not clear to you yet, let me spell this out: Even as you're reading these words, there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thousands</emphasis> of \"Christian Patriots\" living in the United States who sincerely believe that Donald Trump <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">saved them from being eaten by demons</emphasis> when he entered the White House. This is not hyperbole. This is a literal interpretation of what they believe. </p><p>This is the mentality you're dealing with. No amount of logic, common sense or reason can combat such convoluted delusions. These people are clearly the product of incessant brainwashing, and yet they think <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">everyone else</emphasis> in the country is mind-controlled to such an extreme degree that people who do not support Trump are either A) soulless demon-worshippers or B) poor unfortunates incapable of understanding the obvious truths being unveiled by geniuses like \"Rick B2T\" and his pal \"Gene.\" On Nov. 18, 1978, hundreds of \"True Believers\" in Guyana held similar beliefs, only seconds before they literally drank the Kool-Aid.</p><p>You might assume that most of Rick's viewers are hardcore evangelicals dwelling in a deep pit in the Ozarks. But my friend wasn't raised a hardcore Christian and had never expressed such views in my presence over the course of many, many years. Something happened to change him radically between the emergence of QAnon in 2017 and the advent of the national lockdown in 2020. Even a regular Joe can be swayed by nonsense with a fair amount of ease.</p><p>Nonsense has always been an essential part of the American landscape, from Salem witch hunts in the 1690s to New Age UFO cults in the 1990s, but QAnon takes this tradition of nonsense to a whole new level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next installment</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The roots of QAnon: From 1940s science fiction to 19th-century anti-Masonic propaganda</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1597557903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KY-1P81-DYTP-R1WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post via Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first article in a series.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've been involved in the wild world of conspiracy theories for 24 years now, ever since I published my first article in the pages of Paranoia Magazine in the spring of 1996 when I was 24 years old. What most impressed me about Paranoia was the anarchy of information available within its pages. It wasn't a right-wing conspiracy magazine. It wasn't a left-wing conspiracy magazine. It didn't even exist <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">between</emphasis> these two poles. Its editorial mission (or non-mission) was beholden to values (or non-values) that lay far beyond these limiting parameters, a dedication to cataloging and analyzing the extremes of fringe beliefs from multiple points of view. As Marshall McLuhan once said, \"A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.\" The editors of Paranoia dedicated themselves to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> having a point of view. It was the exact opposite of propaganda. By its very nature, propaganda excludes any information that contradicts or undermines the message the dedicated propagandist is intent on disseminating.</p><p>Conspiracy theories have always been used by what we now call \"persuasion engineers\" as tools of mass indoctrination. A good conspiracy theory that seems plausible and frightening enough can be worth more than a thousand well-reasoned stump speeches.</p><p>In my first book, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2464/9781936296408\">Cryptoscatology: Conspiracy Theory as Art Form</url>,\" I broke conspiracy theories down into five distinct categories: 1) Insanity, 2) Disinformation, 3) Misinformation, 4) Satire, and 5) Legitimate Research. Some theories manage to merge two or more categories into one. Only on very rare occasions do such theories manage to combine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis>five categories. The most recent - and arguably most impactful - strain of this hybrid form of conspiracy-mongering first emerged in 2017, promulgated by an anonymous 4chan poster known only as \"Q\" - or \"QAnon.\" You've been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/13/is-qanon-the-new-christian-right-with-evangelicals-fading-a-new-insanity-rises/\">hearing a lot about this lately</url>, most likely. At least one QAnon supporter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/12/trump-says-qanon-supporter-condemned-by-gop-leaders-for-racist-videos-is-future-republican-star/\">is almost certain to be elected to Congress</url> in November, and devotees of this particular conspiracy theory are eagerly supporting the re-election of Donald Trump. </p><p>The average person, who has <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> spent the past couple of decades studying the origins of conspiracy theories (a reasonable choice, I might add), would probably not recognize the origins of most of the quasi-surreal elements that make up the convoluted QAnon narrative.</p><p>Earlier this year, in March, I was talking to a friend about COVID-19 and the national lockdown. He's 10 years older than me and lives in a small town in the Midwest. I live in Long Beach, California. While chatting with him on the phone about all the unexpected difficulties that have arisen from teaching my English classes online, he suddenly volunteered the opinion that COVID-19 would be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">positive</emphasis>development in 2020. </p><p>\"Yeah?\" I asked. \"How so?\" </p><p>He proceeded to tell me, with complete sincerity, that after Trump is re-elected in 2020, he will deliver \"free energy\" to the people of America. Not only that, he's also going to abolish the income tax. Right now, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at this very moment</emphasis>, United States troops have been deployed underground where they're busy \"cleaning out\" covert subterranean tunnels, \"saving hundreds of children from satanic slaves,\" and kicking out the \"black hats.\" Without skipping a beat, my friend then insisted that news of this game-changing development would be \"coming out\" soon. </p><p>\"It's a great thing,\" he told me in measured tones. \"Trump will have to use the Emergency Broadcast System to give this news to the American people because the media keeps lying and social media like Twitter and YouTube are censoring and deleting videos that report reality the way it actually is.\" </p><p>Furthermore, my friend said in tones of absolute certainty, Trump supporters working behind the scenes (referred to by my friend as the \"white hats\") had recently wrested control of the entire Google corporation from devil worshippers, which is why you could now retrieve \"accurate information\" from that particular search engine. </p><p>\"Uh ... where are you getting all this?\" I asked.</p><p>He seemed reluctant to tell me. At first he hemmed and hawed, then muttered, \"Oh ... just these message boards.\" </p><p>\"Well ... what message boards?\" He wouldn't say. \"Could you send me the links?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis> no links,\" he replied.</p><p>\"No links? What is this, the dark web or something?\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Kind of.\"</p><p>When I pushed further and asked for more details about this \"accurate information,\" in a conspiratorial whisper he urged me to search the word \"Adrenochrome\" in Google.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">* * *</emphasis></p><p>I first read Hunter S. Thompson's classic nonfiction book, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" when I was 18. I've taught the book in my English composition classes at Cal State Long Beach, off and on, since 2002. I'm well aware that Thompson's alter ego, Raoul Duke, encounters Adrenochrome when Dr. Gonzo (Duke's speed-fueled attorney) suggests that he ingest the drug because it \"makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.\" He also warns Duke, \"You'll go completely crazy if you take too much.\" Duke claims that the hallucinogenic effects of Adrenochrome work best when the substance is harvested from the adrenaline glands of living human bodies. </p><p>Even at the tender age of 18, I knew that this inspired idea was one of Thompson's many phantasmagorical asides in an otherwise journalistic narrative. Thompson was famous for these detours into Munchausen-level jabberwocky, like the time he claimed that Sen. Ed Muskie was taking \"massive doses\" of a psychedelic drug called Ibogaine during the 1972 presidential campaign, a hilarious (and entirely false) tale related in Thompson's \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.\" </p><p>On the commentary track that accompanies the 2003 Criterion DVD release of Terry Gilliam's film adaptation of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" Gilliam confirms that Adrenochrome is \"a totally invented nonsense-drug that Hunter [made up].\" Gilliam follows this with an eerily prescient statement that almost foreshadows the introduction of the drug into QAnon's ever-expanding mythology: \"This scene had such an effect on so many people that afterwards I was hearing kids say, 'Oh, I've had Adrenochrome!' They were talking about where they get it. 'Oh, there's a guy who can get me Adrenochrome.' I just love how the Big Lie always works. It worked for Hitler, and it can work for people like us [i.e., artists and storytellers].\" </p><p>It appears to be working for QAnon as well, since \"totally invented nonsense\" has a way of becoming facts in the minds of the gullible, the semi-informed, the frustrated and the insane.</p><p>So I did exactly as my friend suggested. I googled the word \"Adrenochrome.\" Keep in mind that my friend insisted that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had taken control of Google, so I would receive only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">accurate</emphasis> information from that search engine when inputting this particular word.</p><p>The first result that popped up was Emily Writes' March 17, 2020, article in Spinoff entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/17-03-2020/emily-writes-down-the-rabbit-hole-with-the-covid-19-conspiracy-theorists/\">Down the Rabbit Hole With the COVID-19 Conspiracy Theorists</url>,\" which begins as follows:</p><p>Today I fell down a rabbit hole of rabid Trump supporters who are convinced COVID-19 is both a hoax and also Trump's greatest moment as president. He has acted decisively apparently, while also knowing that COVID-19 is a Hollywood Liberal Elite cover-up .... <url normalizedValue=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/07-04-2020/explainer-adrenochrome-the-drug-that-doesnt-exist/\">Adrenochrome</url> is a drug for the liberal elite of Hollywood made from actual human brain stem containing hormones from the adrenal gland. Hillary Clinton manufactures this drug by torturing children in a pizza shop .... Tom Hanks is addicted to Adrenochrome and he caught COVID-19 from the latest batch of tainted Adrenochrome that came through Celine Dion who is a high priestess from the Church of Satan. She is well-versed in poison as she's been lacing her children's clothing line with a chemical that makes our children \"gender neutral.\" Tom Hanks signalled to the Hollywood Liberal Elite Cabal DeepState in his Golden Globes acceptance speech that there would be a shortage of Adrenochrome. Ellen has closed her studio audience because she's addicted as well. </p><p>After reading this article in its entirety, I emailed my friend and pointed out that when I put his advice to the test and Googled \"Adrenochrome,\" the first article that popped up sardonically tore the entire conspiracy theory to shreds. How did this jibe with the notion that Trump-supporting \"white hats\" had total control over Google?</p><p>I received no direct answer to this question. I was told, instead, to search the name \"Rachel Chandler.\" This would somehow answer <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> my questions. Bypassing those pesky \"white hats\" at Google, I decided to use a different search engine called Millionshort, and almost immediately found a March 22, 2019, Daily Dot article entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-rachel-chandler/\">QAnon Is Attacking a Random Woman in a Disturbing and Dangerous Way</url>,\" which detailed how QAnon posts had become strangely focused on a photographer and casting director named Rachel Chandler, who is part of the newspaper-owning Chandler family but has no visible political footprint and is not otherwise a public figure:</p><p>Q made a seemingly endless stream of posts referencing Chandler, insinuating that she took a 2017 picture of Bill Clinton and registered child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (whose light prison sentence handed down by current Trump cabinet official Alexander Acosta is currently under investigation) hanging out together in a pool.</p><p>Beyond that, QAnon accused Chandler of \"procuring\" \"girls\" for Epstein, having her photography studio funded by elite Satanists who used it for rituals, flaunting Epstein's \"sex and torture room victims\" with her pictures, having a link to a still-unexplained (yet supposedly horrific) event at the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood ....</p><p>To be clear, Chandler has not been accused of any wrongdoing by any law enforcement agency .... There's no evidence she took the pool picture that QAnon claims proves she's linked to Epstein, and it doesn't even feature him - though it does feature George Nader, the convicted pedophile who's providing evidence in the Mueller investigation regarding President Donald Trump's link to meetings with Russian officials.</p><p>And yet Chandler's name has been dragged into the conspiracy so completely that the first page of a Google search shows nothing but QAnon-related content, while five of the top six videos that come up when searching her name are by QAnon acolytes.</p><p>None of the many videos and speculations posted by QAnon and his numerous supporters provide any definitive links between Chandler and Jeffrey Epstein, yet somehow this red herring has received intense focus from thousands of amateur detectives, most of whom no doubt have a sincere desire to get to \"the truth.\" </p><p>One might argue, as does Emily Writes in her above-mentioned Spinoff article, that when \"people feel like they have no control over their lives - like in the midst of a global pandemic - the comforting certainty of conspiracy theories seems increasingly attractive.\" One might also argue that racism, xenophobia and (perhaps most deadly of all) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">neophobia</emphasis> fuel the interest in such theories. But I think these explanations, while partially valid, ignore the heart-meat core of the real issue plaguing America at this moment.</p><p>The real problem is that genuine conspiracies are unfolding before our eyes every day, but when the mainstream media avoids reporting on such conspiracies - for a whole variety of reasons, the main one being that it's simply easier to get paid rewriting corporate press releases and slapping one's byline on the end product than by actually putting one's reputation on the line tackling a plethora of inconvenient truths - it becomes necessary for average people to fill in the gaps on their own. These people may be ignorant, but they're not stupid. They know instinctively that they're being victimized by blatant lies every day. So, with no training whatsoever, they perform \"research\" on their own by scouring through a multiplicity of such \"reliable\" online sources as 4chan, 8chan, 8kun and Reddit.</p><p>As award-winning science fiction writer <url normalizedValue=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/\">Cory Doctorow wrote in May</url> of this year:</p><p>[W]hy is it so easy to find people who want to believe in conspiracies[?] My answer: because so many of the things that have traumatized so many people ARE conspiracies.</p><p>The opioid epidemic was a conspiracy between rich families like the Sacklers and regulators who rotate in and out of industry. The 737 crisis was caused by Boeing's conspiracy to cut corners and aviation regulators' conspiracy to allow aerospace to regulate itself.</p><p>Senators conspire to liquidate their positions ahead of coronavirus lockdown, well-heeled multinationals conspire to get 94.5% of the \"small business\" PPP fund, Big Tech conspires to fix wages with illegal collusion while fast food franchises do the same with noncompetes.</p><p>In a world of constant real conspiracy scandals that destroy lives and the planet, conspiracy theories take on real explanatory power. </p><p>Everything Doctorow says here is true; however, we rarely apply such clinical observations to people we know <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personally</emphasis>. Often, we use such explanations to dismiss the cockeyed beliefs of peculiar strangers encountered online. Before March of this year, I had known my friend to be a rational person with a fair amount of real-world experience and common sense, not someone who would be swayed easily by illogical rhetoric or over-the-top nonsense. On the other hand, I hadn't been in close contact with him since the last presidential election and the birth of QAnon, who emerged from internet obscurity in November of 2017.  This was, coincidentally, the same time period when Trump's approval ratings had reached a \"near-record low.\" (The full effect of QAnon on Trump's approval ratings since November of 2017 has not been studied in any substantial way.) </p><p>After about four weeks had passed, I emailed my friend and asked him a few more questions about QAnon, trying to understand how anyone could believe so many unsubstantiated claims with so little skepticism. Surely, I thought, there must be something at least halfway reasonable to back up these outrageous statements. I needed to know the source so I could evaluate the claims myself. On May 3, I sent him the following email:</p><p>I'm trying to wrap my head around this whole QAnon thing, so maybe you can help me. I have a few questions.</p><p>Why would the United States military be \"cleaning out\" covert underground bases when they're the ones who <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">built</emphasis>the bases in the first place? Who else but the U.S. military would be in charge of massive underground bases built on U.S. soil? </p><p>Why would Trump be interested in implementing free energy? Isn't he trying to revive the coal industry? It would seem to me that free energy would undermine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> of his business interests.</p><p>According to most reliable sources, censorship on Google seems to be alive and well at the moment, which is nothing new. (In my experience, I've found that millionshort.com is a far better search engine tool.) </p><p>I'm not certain that \"white hats\" exist in our current political situation. Perhaps \"black hats,\" \"slightly-less-black hats,\" and \"gray hats\" would be more accurate terms?</p><p>Didn't the whole concept of \"Adrenochrome\" being harvested from live human beings originate with Hunter S. Thompson - as a satirical concept? I always thought that passage in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was intended as a joke. Is QAnon claiming that Hunter S. Thompson had \"insider knowledge\" when he wrote the book?</p><p>The next day, my friend responded to my questions with another question: \"You're a researcher. Why are you playing D.U.M.B.?\" That's it. Nothing else.</p><p>Since I had no idea why he had written the word \"dumb\" as an acronym, I replied, \"I'm not playing 'D.U.M.B.' I honestly don't know the answers to those questions. I'm trying to understand the proposed scenario. If you have the answers, I'd love to hear them.\"</p><p>Later that day, he wrote me back and explained that \"D.U.M.B.\" stood for \"Deep Underground Military Bases.\" The explanation rendered the first message even more confusing than before. (How could I possibly be playing \"Deep Underground Military Bases\"? I resisted the urge to ask him to elucidate further, as I suspected the response would just add to my befuddlement.) He sent me several links as well, despite the fact that a month earlier he had insisted that there <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were no links</emphasis> he could possibly send me. He never bothered to explain how or why this situation had changed during the past four weeks. </p><p>Inevitably, the first link led me to QAnon's posts. Most of these posts were so cryptic, they didn't answer any of my questions. </p><p>Addressing my question about Trump delivering free energy to the American people, my friend responded, \"President Trump's uncle John was asked by the F.B.I. to investigate Nikola Tesla's papers.\" This terse sentence was then followed by a link to an Aug. 2, 2017, post at Heavy.com entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/john-trump-donald-uncle-mit-nikola-tesla-g-george-time-travel/\">John Trump, Donald's Uncle: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know</url>.\" Right after the link, my friend wrote, \"And you wonder where I come up with free energy for the nation in the future.\" </p><p>Nothingin the Heavy.com post suggested that Donald Trump was working on delivering free energy to the United States during his second term in office. </p><p>Attempting to address one of my other questions, he wrote, \"If Google's censorship is on, then why, when you search 'Rachel Chandler,' you get all of this information about her?\" </p><p>Of course this is a perfect example of \"circular reasoning.\" Everything QAnon says about Rachel Chandler is true because, when you Google \"Rachel Chandler,\" all of QAnon's posts pop up. Therefore, everything QAnon said about Rachel Chandler is true. (If A, then B. If B, then A. Or perhaps I should say, \"If Q, then Q. If Q, then Q.\")</p><p>To answer my other questions, he sent me links to three different YouTube videos, one of which dealt with the untold story of the Deep Underground Military Bases. </p><p>The first video (entitled \"The Underground War, Happening Now\") features a \"Christian Patriot\" named \"Rick B2T\" in conversation with an anonymous fellow calling himself \"Gene.\" I subjected myself to 38 minutes and 16 seconds of unsubstantiated rumors about U.S. Christian soldiers battling demon-worshipping members of the Illuminati in deep underground bases. </p><p>This directed me to an even more convoluted YouTube video entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V3Ew130Gug\">1 of 2 - Best of 'Underground War Details! Part 8' - Gene Decode - B2T Show</url>,\" in which I learned that Gene had decided to risk his life going public with these dangerous secrets because, one fateful day, God had contacted Gene and expressly told him, \"This information <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">has</emphasis> to come out!\" At this point, Gene teamed up with an anonymous former \"Canadian military officer\" to reveal the disturbing truths about these \"Deep Underground Military Bases\" where (and this is a direct quote) \"animal and human sacrifices nourish the bowels of creatures - in other words, we're talking demonic, terrible <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">things</emphasis> that inhabited Earth long before Man arrived.\" </p><p>After this startling revelation, Gene elaborated on the scenario further: \"The New World Order is in the final stages - that is, they <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">were</emphasis>, until Trump came along - the final stages of their satanic plan to reduce the current world population by 80 to 90 percent [...]. If it weren't for Trump, most of us would not be listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anything</emphasis> right now.\" [Gene chuckles darkly.] \"Instead of the Word of Christ, you'd be listening to the angels.\"</p><p>As of May 28, only 10 days after being posted, this video had already received 33,105 views and only <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">34</emphasis> dislikes. I've seen YouTube videos of random kids opening birthday presents get more dislikes than that. The Blessed to Teach YouTube channel has 92,600 subscribers. </p><p>If it's not clear to you yet, let me spell this out: Even as you're reading these words, there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thousands</emphasis> of \"Christian Patriots\" living in the United States who sincerely believe that Donald Trump <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">saved them from being eaten by demons</emphasis> when he entered the White House. This is not hyperbole. This is a literal interpretation of what they believe. </p><p>This is the mentality you're dealing with. No amount of logic, common sense or reason can combat such convoluted delusions. These people are clearly the product of incessant brainwashing, and yet they think <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">everyone else</emphasis> in the country is mind-controlled to such an extreme degree that people who do not support Trump are either A) soulless demon-worshippers or B) poor unfortunates incapable of understanding the obvious truths being unveiled by geniuses like \"Rick B2T\" and his pal \"Gene.\" On Nov. 18, 1978, hundreds of \"True Believers\" in Guyana held similar beliefs, only seconds before they literally drank the Kool-Aid.</p><p>You might assume that most of Rick's viewers are hardcore evangelicals dwelling in a deep pit in the Ozarks. But my friend wasn't raised a hardcore Christian and had never expressed such views in my presence over the course of many, many years. Something happened to change him radically between the emergence of QAnon in 2017 and the advent of the national lockdown in 2020. Even a regular Joe can be swayed by nonsense with a fair amount of ease.</p><p>Nonsense has always been an essential part of the American landscape, from Salem witch hunts in the 1690s to New Age UFO cults in the 1990s, but QAnon takes this tradition of nonsense to a whole new level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next installment</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The roots of QAnon: From 1940s science fiction to 19th-century anti-Masonic propaganda</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1597783671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MG-WWH1-DYTP-R00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration opened the door a little wider for flights over people, though not deliveries, in a new draft rule.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the weight goes up - one company is testing at 13 pounds - a fast-moving drone becomes more dangerous. Over time, middleweight business drones could outnumber the amateur-flown featherweights. One credible estimate predicts that in 20 years the U.S. will have at least 8 million drone deliveries a day.</p><p>Both of the tech giants pursuing the drone-delivery business, Amazon and Wing, the unit of Google parent Alphabet, say they are ready to fly package-delivery drones with redundant safety systems.</p><p>Until recently, what was safe enough remained unsettled. \"The truth of the matter,\" Juan J. Alonso, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University testified before a House aviation subcommittee in late 2017, is that \"no technologist knows what this required level of safety ought to be ...\" because it's uncertain what level of risks and trade-offs society will tolerate.</p><p>Last month, the FAA started filling in some of the blanks. In a new proposed rule for drone flights over people, the FAA based its safety approach on preventing serious injuries if the drone crashes into someone on the ground. The rule invites drone companies to design the drones or add safety features to limit the harm.</p><p>A host of questions remain unanswered. Should drones themselves be required to carry safety features such as sensors or parachutes? Can the risk of hitting someone be significantly reduced by accurate flight-management systems that keep the drones on course?</p><p>More broadly, are Americans willing to endure drone accidents in exchange for more convenience and freedom, as they do with automobiles? Or will the safety measures required to win public acceptance be too restrictive, heavy and costly to be acceptable to the big tech companies, aviation firms and startups hoping to see a payoff from drone commerce?</p><p>Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos stirred excitement about deliveries in late 2013 when he predicted in a 60 Minutes interview that within three to five years, his company would be landing orders at American doorsteps 30 minutes after a customer hit the buy button. A company video dramatized the possibility.</p><p>Given all Amazon had done, his prediction had an air of inevitability. But the FAA initially balked when Amazon wanted to start U.S. flight tests in 2015.</p><p>To drone companies, the FAA seemed like a labyrinth of creaky bureaucrats.</p><p>\"It was two different worlds trying to cooperate,\" said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone. \"One is meticulous about safety. The other is devoted to finding disruptive technologies.\"</p><p>Shut out temporarily in the U.S., Amazon's Prime Air unit did most of its testing outside the U.S. at development centers in Austria, France and Israel. The company's first pilotless, autonomous delivery flight was completed in Cambridgeshire, England, in late 2016. And Wing, which has tested in Australia, just started flying delivery drones as part of a test program in Finland.</p><p>The current rules for drones under 55 pounds - adopted by the FAA in 2016 - are built on the idea of keeping people and drones apart by prohibiting flights over people, beyond the vision of the pilot or at night.</p><p>And measured alongside the golden yardstick of passenger aviation - a safety success story - the drone industry is off to a good start.</p><p>Although some illegal flights are being investigated as the cause of service shutdowns recently at London and Newark, N.J., airports, no one has been killed or severely hurt, even after hundreds of thousands of flights by lightweight, battery-powered consumer drones controlled by ham-handed amateur pilots.</p><p>The FAA started commissioning a new program of drone research in 2016, using a scale of injuries devised for automobile accidents.</p><p>Possibly because it wears two hats - safety watchdog and industry promoter - the FAA's initial public presentation of its own sponsored ground collision safety report emphasized some good news in April 2017: The popular Phantom 3, a 2.7-pound drone made by Da Jiang International, packed less of a wallop when dropped on a human head than a block of wood or steel of the same weight, with much less potential for serious or severe injury.</p><p>Other researchers had already started evaluating the danger of a heavier drone falling or going out of control, however, and the news was less cheering.</p><p>For example, a Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University team carried out drone crash tests with sensor-embedded dummies. Writing in the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, the researchers reported that models over 15 pounds had a higher than 50 percent risk of inflicting serious injury to the head and neck.</p><p>A separate study by government contractor MITRE Corp. considered even heavier drones of 23 pounds and found that because being hit by one is \"most likely fatal, the real risk is whether a person gets struck or not.\"</p><p>The first level of safety in the FAA's new proposed rule for flights over people would limit the mass and velocity to small drones that some in the industry believe would stop them from being used for anything more than photography and surveying.</p><p>The maximum blow would be something short of a Harry Potter hardcover - say, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, at 2.6 pounds - falling off a 4-foot-high table and hitting a tile floor.</p><p>Only lightweight, fixed-wing drones of a pound or two could comply with such a conservative level, says Logan Campbell, president of drone-data consultant Aerotas. \"Your traditional large multirotor drone doesn't qualify,\" he says.</p><p>And although the rules don't apply to deliveries, \"no way you could deliver more than a pair of socks and still follow these rules,\" Campbell says.</p><p>A second, lower-safety threshold for flights over people, yielding the possibility of about twice as forceful a blow, would require drone operators to avoid crowds, stick to restricted areas and not hover over anyone.</p><p>Since it's hard to tweak a delivery drone to meet crash criteria for limiting injuries, the drone companies prefer to base their safety-performance rationale on the expectation of nearly flawless flying.</p><p>The FAA hasn't settled on a system yet to manage the massive number of anticipated drone flights, but flying drones would be safer if they are piloted or programmed to avoid crowded areas.</p><p>To illustrate the different levels of risk, David Arterburn, head of the drone ground-level collision severity study conducted for the FAA's drone Center of Excellence, and head of a rotorcraft program at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, used the example of a baseball stadium in his study. It has a sparsely populated outfield, busier infield and fans in closely spaced seats.</p><p>\"The probability of hitting anyone on the playing field was excruciatingly low,\" he said last year on the fringes of an FAA drone conference.</p><p>But when delivery drones finally are authorized to fly, their limited battery power means they may have to take the most efficient and direct path possible. And dropping off packages will involve closer proximity to power lines, streetlights and people.</p><p>Some drones already come with detect-and-avoid features, but the exact combination of radar, optical and acoustic sensors or lasers needed for business drones isn't settled yet. Engineers continue to improve and miniaturize the complicated combination of equipment and software for in-flight adjustments.</p><p>Gur Kimchi, a leader of Amazon's delivery-drone initiative, said last year that no delivery drone for his company should fly blind.</p><p>Such systems \"are not necessary for every scenario,\" Kimchi said, but \"we choose to implement them because of how\" Amazon's team plans its drone- delivery operations. While the systems \"are complex and they are hard\" to perfect, \"they are necessary if you want the vehicle to look at the world and make the safe decision.\"</p><p>Parachutes are another type of safety feature that can be added. Amber McDonald, president of Anchorage-based Indemnis, a drone-parachute-system manufacturer, said parachute-recovery systems make sense because \"20 pounds of metal falling out of the sky\" is dangerous. Her company's pitch is that \"rather than waiting for a tombstone, we're adding this layer of safety.\"</p><p>But depending on drone size and wind, parachutes don't guarantee that an out-of-control drone will float harmlessly to earth.</p><p>After testing, \"one of our realizations was, when we want to worry about the drone's safety, parachutes are great,\" said James Ryan Burgess, chief executive of Wing, in an interview last year at the same FAA drone conference. But \"actually we want to worry about society's safety and hold ourselves to a standard of reliability where you just don't crash, rather than have a parachute come down on a freeway for example, where it can cause a lot of disruption.\"</p><p>Another problem with adding any onboard safety features is that their weight and power requirements affect many other drone components and capabilities: battery, rotors, wings, airframe, velocity, total maximum flight time and load-carrying potential.</p><p>Those systems have \"tremendous impact\" on the drone design and performance potential, said Jay Gundlach, co-founder of FlightHouse Engineering and author of \"Civil and Commercial Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\"</p><p>While onboard safety features can help cap the force of the collision, the added weight may limit the battery capacity or payload that determine the drone's usefulness, said Gundlach. That affects performance, such as how long the drone can hover, he said.</p><p>In other words, weight-limited drones will carry less cargo or sensors and fly shorter distances. Any weight for safety equipment will further limit the utility.</p><p>Gundlach thinks that skies busy with drones will pose less risk to the public, and produce fewer fatalities for the work accomplished, than ground transportation or small, privately operated airplanes now do. He said that a 5-ounce baseball is more likely to deliver a fatal blow than a small drone, especially since some drones have flexible, lightweight plastic parts that absorb energy in a crash.</p><p>Yet unlike many in the drone industry, Gundlach also freely admits that in a world where heavier drones are flying often, as with all forms of transportation, \"it is only a matter of time until you have fatalities.\"</p><p>His views are similar to those of a team from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which issued a report last year criticizing the FAA staff for being overly preoccupied with possible drone accidents.</p><p>It urged the FAA to get out of the way of drone-industry innovators who can help create new businesses and jobs.</p><p>The drone-delivery companies seem resigned to playing the long game, and it's easy to understand why.</p><p>Each \"last-mile\" package delivery completed using the U.S. Postal Service costs Amazon about $2.50, estimates a team of economists and drone experts who studied the issue in 2017.</p><p>Retailers ought to be able to save about 76 cents with deliveries whose final miles involve a drone, says Bijan Vasigh, a professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, who was part that team. Some of the savings will come from one person monitoring several flights at a time.</p><p>Years from now, drones that could make more than one delivery per flight may save retailers even more.</p><p>So the testing and regulation-writing goes on. The FAA has not yet even asked for comments on its new proposed rule. For many in the drone industry, it goes on too long.</p><p>Over time, many drone and aviation law veterans say, a new class of professional pilots monitoring partly autonomous commercial drone flights will come into its own - and the freewheeling era of drone flights will end.</p><p>\"Nothing terrible has happened, and there have been virtually no serious incidents from tens and hundreds of thousands of drone flights,\" said Henry H. Perritt Jr., a pilot and professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law.</p><p>Experience will teach what is safe, Perritt added. And if there are accidents, \"Government regulators can always step in and write new rules.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-9518265c363611e9adfcb176dc107f4c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH0-94D1-JBKM-D4FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
