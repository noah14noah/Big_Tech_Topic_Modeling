The BBC's Media Editor Amol Rajan, spoke to one mother who has been calling for action after her daughter was groomed on social media. I don't think there was anything more that we could have done. And, believe me, I've quizzed myself over and over and over. </p><p>Is there something I missed? I don't think there was stop Snapchat is one of the platforms he was using to message her. He admitted to the police the reason it was Snapchat was because there are no chat logs, no evidence. We can now speak to Andy Burrows, Head of Child Safety and Online Policy at the NSPCC. I know you been calling for this kind of thing for many years now. So what is going to happen as far as you know? Well, you're absolutely right, Louise, we have been campaigning for this day since 2017. Our understanding is the government will commit to statutory regulation, it will name of, as that regulator and, crucially, it will commit to placing a legally enforceable duty of care onto tech firms. Now, how we want the two were, and is the model we have been pushing for, as this means platforms should have a very clear legal responsibility to identify all the types of risks that children could be exposed to on the big social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat and then those sites have a responsibility to take all reasonable measures to ensure those risks can be reasonably effectively mitigated and if platforms continue to sit on their hands, if they don't take necessary safety measures, then the regulator should ensure those really tough consequences. Yes, so let's talk about the consequences. As far as you understand, what will they be able to do was yellow as far as we understand it, the government is not going to set out those measures today. But we are very clear that this has to be a regulator with teeth. That means that Ofcom will have to have the powers to lift up the bonnet on how tech forms -- firms operate and what steps if any they take to protect children, and then have really strong enforcement powers. So those need to be very stringent fines. We also need to see the threat of criminal sanctions and those need to be levied both against the company as a corporate entity, but also against named directors, because if we are really going to see change here it has to be a cultural change and how platforms operate, how they consider children. So we need to see platforms being made to name direct as who were responsible for the key decisions about children's safety without -- with the threat of criminal action if those directors are negligent. Will those different companies, will they have to agree to this, how will it work? So this will be a legal requirement on tech firms. I think for far too long tech firms have held great sway, too mostly with government, with the argument this is something that could only be done internationally, that this was somehow too complex, that tech is somehow too different from every other sector of the economy. This will be a legal requirement. The UK has the ability to do this. We are one of the biggest markets for all of the big tech firms. And we are very clear at the NSPCC if the UK does this and we set out really a British model for how we can protect children online, in turn that will go on and become the global standard. There is very keen interest internationally. And if the government introduces this quickly and effectively I'm very confident we will see other countries that follow suit. You talk about quickly, how soon could be put in place? So there's absolutely no reason why we couldn't have online harms at on the statute book within 18 months and off, up and running taking these decisions. And there is urgency behind this. Every single day since the online harms white paper last year when the government first set out its intentions to regulate, we've seen 90 offences, 90 online offences against children every single day. We know that the scale, the complexity of the online threat that children face is just getting worse. And so every day that we wait we know that more children, unfortunately, will be put at risk. So this is absolutely vital we see this quickly. Well, listen, Andy Burrows, head of child online safety, thank you very much. The race to be Labour's next leader is well under way, with the field now narrowed to just four candidates. This week, local Labour parties will be nominating their favourites, before the ballot is opened to all party members. Tens of thousands of people have joined Labour since the election and will get a vote in this contest. Political correspondent Alex Forsyth, went to Worksop in Nottinghamshire to meet some.

It is time to talk today. to Carol, who was out on the roof What's it like up there? It is a wee bit breezy but it's not too bad. </p><p>It's a mild start to the day to of us. Except the parts of the South, especially the south-west. We are looking at just a touch or two of frost. It is going to be a mild day, albeit rather cloudy in the some of us, rain coming in from the west. You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the West over time. The weather front which is quite active, producing heavy rain, heavier than the rain we saw yesterday. That rain fringing in close to the Isles of Scilly, moving across Northern Ireland. Also of course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still across eastern counties but heavy rain for a time across northern and Northwest Scotland and snow above about 400m. Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales. Looking at some clearer skies and some showers which will be wintry on the hills. We've got the cloud in the rain but it will be particularly cold. Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be going towards the east. As we head into Sunday, a mixture of sunshine and showers. The highest temperatures will be across southern areas and in London, 13 degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Carol, that bench beside you, it Finishing with a smile as good. looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations. The EEC is looking to them to pay a 3% tax on every bit of money they generate in each of the countries and they reckon it would generate about #4.4 billion in revenue all EU countries and this would apply to things like on line advertising, social media advertising. They are accused of streaming through countries with different tax systems. The implication is they have done something wrong. Have they?

It is time to talk today. to Carol, who was out on the roof What's it like up there? It is a wee bit breezy but it's not too bad. It's a mild start to the day to of us. </p><p>Except the parts of the South, especially the south-west. We are looking at just a touch or two of frost. It is going to be a mild day, albeit rather cloudy in the some of us, rain coming in from the west. You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the West over time. The weather front which is quite active, producing heavy rain, heavier than the rain we saw yesterday. That rain fringing in close to the Isles of Scilly, moving across Northern Ireland. Also of course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still across eastern counties but heavy rain for a time across northern and Northwest Scotland and snow above about 400m. Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales. Looking at some clearer skies and some showers which will be wintry on the hills. We've got the cloud in the rain but it will be particularly cold. Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be going towards the east. As we head into Sunday, a mixture of sunshine and showers. The highest temperatures will be across southern areas and in London, 13 degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Carol, that bench beside you, it Finishing with a smile as good. looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations. The EEC is looking to them to pay a 3% tax on every bit of money they generate in each of the countries and they reckon it would generate about #4.4 billion in revenue all EU countries and this would apply to things like on line advertising, social media advertising. They are accused of streaming through countries with different tax systems. The implication is they have done something wrong. Have they? They say they have not broken any laws, but the European Commission says it still is not there is something needs to change. There is no physical presence is the result is, as far as we know, those companies pay something like 9% corporate tax while the rest of the economy pays 23% and there is a problem of level playing field, a problem of fairness and equity there</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-07923b9dc7e3489b91f2459e37cb082e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-54V1-JBH6-C4TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be going towards the east. As we head into Sunday, a mixture of sunshine and showers. The highest temperatures will be across southern areas and in London, 13 degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Carol, that bench beside you, it Finishing with a smile as good. looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations. The EEC is looking to them to pay a 3% tax on every bit of money they generate in each of the countries and they reckon it would generate about #4.4 billion in revenue all EU countries and this would apply to things like on line advertising, social media advertising. They are accused of streaming through countries with different tax systems. The implication is they have done something wrong. Have they? They say they have not broken any laws, but the European Commission says it still is not there is something needs to change.

You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the West over time. The weather front which is quite active, producing heavy rain, heavier than the rain we saw yesterday. That rain fringing in close to the Isles of Scilly, moving across Northern Ireland. Also of course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still across eastern counties but heavy rain for a time across northern and Northwest Scotland and snow above about 400m. Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales.

It is time to talk today. to Carol, who was out on the roof What's it like up there? It is a wee bit breezy but it's not too bad. It's a mild start to the day to of us. </p><p>Except the parts of the South, especially the south-west. We are looking at just a touch or two of frost. It is going to be a mild day, albeit rather cloudy in the some of us, rain coming in from the west. You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the West over time. The weather front which is quite active, producing heavy rain, heavier than the rain we saw yesterday. That rain fringing in close to the Isles of Scilly, moving across Northern Ireland. Also of course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still across eastern counties but heavy rain for a time across northern and Northwest Scotland and snow above about 400m. Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales. Looking at some clearer skies and some showers which will be wintry on the hills. We've got the cloud in the rain but it will be particularly cold. Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be going towards the east. As we head into Sunday, a mixture of sunshine and showers. The highest temperatures will be across southern areas and in London, 13 degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Carol, that bench beside you, it Finishing with a smile as good. looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations. The EEC is looking to them to pay a 3% tax on every bit of money they generate in each of the countries and they reckon it would generate about #4.4 billion in revenue all EU countries and this would apply to things like on line advertising, social media advertising. They are accused of streaming through countries with different tax systems. The implication is they have done something wrong. Have they? They say they have not broken any laws, but the European Commission says it still is not there is something needs to change. There is no physical presence is the result is, as far as we know, those companies pay something like 9% corporate tax while the rest of the economy pays 23% and there is a problem of level playing field, a problem of fairness and equity there</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-8148783818814f4b9c85ed14957ba5f0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-54V1-JBH6-C4TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

It is time to talk to Carol, who was out on the roof today. What's it like up there? It is a wee bit breezy but it's not too bad. </p><p>It's a mild start to the day to of us. Except the parts of the South, especially the south-west. We are looking at just a touch or two of frost. It is going to be a mild day, albeit rather cloudy in the some of us, rain coming in from the west. You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the West over time. The weather front which is quite active, producing heavy rain, heavier than the rain we saw yesterday. That rain fringing in close to the Isles of Scilly, moving across Northern Ireland. Also of course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still across eastern counties but heavy rain for a time across northern and Northwest Scotland and snow above about 400m. Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales. Looking at some clearer skies and some showers which will be wintry on the hills. We've got the cloud in the rain but it will be particularly cold. Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be going towards the east. As we head into Sunday, a mixture of sunshine and showers. The highest temperatures will be across southern areas and in London, 13 degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Finishing with a smile as good. Carol, that bench beside you, it looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations. The EEC is looking to them to pay a 3% tax on every bit of money they generate in each of the countries and they reckon it would generate about #4.4 billion in revenue all EU countries and this would apply to things like on line advertising, social media advertising. They are accused of streaming through countries with different tax systems. The implication is they have done something wrong. Have they?

It is a wee bit breezy but it's not too bad. It's a looking at just a touch or two of frost. </p><p>It is going to be a mild day, albeit rather cloudy in the some of us, rain coming in from the west. You look at the forecast, the brightest skies will be from the east, when we lose the dregs of the rain. Cloud building in from the across Northern Ireland. Also of West over time. The course western Scotland. The brightest skies will be in the east. Temperatures in Aberdeen could get up to 13 Celsius. Then as we had on to the evening and overnight, that band of rain continues its journey, moving east and pushing northwards. The Northern edge will be the heaviest and you can see how it curls around. Not a particularly cold night but we will see some clear skies here and there. As we start the day tomorrow, the dregs of the rain still Some showers in the West, bright skies and sunshine. Later on, the next system starts to show its hand. Yesterday, we had this further note -- further north but we didn't think it would be as far north. It will track across some Southern counties. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud across England and Wales. Looking at some clearer skies and some showers which will be wintry on the hills. We've got the cloud in the rain but it will be particularly cold. Then we start the day again with the dregs of the rain across the south-east. Quite a lot of cloud here as well. Also some sunshine and showers. Most of the the east. As we head into southern areas and in London, 13 highest temperatures will be across degrees. All in all, it is that bit milder. Something to look forward to at least. Carol, that bench beside you, it Finishing with a smile as good. looks like the perfect place to sit down, have a cup of tea and feed the pigeons. I like the first bit, not the second bit. You now how mucky pigeons can be. But they are also sweet. I am with Carol on that one. Pigeon haters? Not so much haters, I don't want to share my cup of tea with them. The pigeons are probably not interested in your cup of tea. What I had a sandwich? The cheese and pickle sandwich wouldn't be safe. Speaking of tea and pickle sandwiches, have come to talk of us about Facebook and tax issues. They are reeling under the data protection issues right now. Facebook, Apple, Google, the big tech companies. Because they don't have a physical presence, they have to follow full tax regulations.

But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content.

But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo.

But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts.

But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition.

But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition.

Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. And the competition is intense. </p><p>These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-4a46889053854531927b4d4665758011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KN-RS71-JBH6-C361-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. And the competition is intense. </p><p>These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that?

Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. And the competition is intense. </p><p>These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, and purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that's after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming an even greater part of daily life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Mini-Programs allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone, without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to rollout its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that?

Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts.

There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey.

In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture.

Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. </p><p>Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-1cc88b3d2f574692bab7f8c44a6a8170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-9561-DY08-30JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

In this contest, we hope to come across new creative ideas that we can adapt and use in our police matters. Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. Enter a sideshow that involves this tiny drone. Tell me what this is. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey.

CO2 gas pumps here firing at those drones as they come around the corner. They've got to get past this tennis ball machine which is going to fire balls.

With all this destruction of kit going on, it's perhaps surprising no-one is called the cops but that's because they are the ones sponsoring the event. In this contest, we hope to come across new creative ideas that we can adapt and use in our police matters. Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. Enter a sideshow that involves this tiny drone. Tell me what this is. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-d06478ded09c4786b7bfb6bf2cfef476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPP-MWM1-DY08-33BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code.

CO2 gas pumps here firing at those drones as they come around the corner. They've got to get past this tennis ball machine which is going to fire balls. There is going to be a man with a gun that fires a net through this hole to try to take out those drones if they come round. </p><p>Lights will be flushing to try to blind the pilots but once they get down this corridor of doom, death and destruction, they get to their opponent's arena and a chance to take out the queen. With all this destruction of kit going on, it's perhaps surprising no-one is called the cops but that's because they are the ones sponsoring the event. In this contest, we hope to come across new creative ideas that we can adapt and use in our police matters. Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. Enter a sideshow that involves this tiny drone. Tell me what this is. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads.

Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. </p><p>Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-364ca209d06a4cb19b1a9d75b8f702eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-9561-DY08-30JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. </p><p>Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture.
