Depending on whom you ask, it's either a magical world where tedious workday tasks are automated and phones serve up recommendations and information unasked, or it's a terrifying surveillance-state dystopia in which machine learning is deepening inequality, robots are coming to take all the jobs, and privacy and human dignity are things of the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Which will it be? In this feature, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis> looks at books that explore the intersection of business, money, and The Future, underscoring the excitement and unease of a fast-changing world.</p><p>The First Law of Robotics</p><p>Excitement and fear vie for the upper hand in discussions about the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and algorithms. Some see a rosy future when workers are freed from the tedium of repetitive tasks to focus on creative work; others warn of the day when we'll all feel an articulated metal hand on our shoulder and turn to see the robot that's replacing us.</p><p>Those who aren't even sure what AI stands for will find an accessible primer in Janelle Shane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">You Look Like a Thing and I Love You </emphasis>(Little, Brown, Nov.). Illustrated with charming cartoons, oddball case studies (self-driving cars in Australia were confused by kangaroos), and wry observations about the often-hilarious failures of artificial intelligences to comprehend human contexts-the title is the result of an AI attempting to generate a successful pickup line-this is \"a skeptic's manual to evaluate AI for yourself,\" says Little, Brown associate editor Nicky Guerreiro, and \"a book that makes you sound smart at a party.\"</p><p>Several authors are urging a cool head, even while presenting views of the future that many will find both shiny and scary. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The AI Advantage</emphasis> (MIT, Oct.), Thomas H. Davenport, IT and management professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., proposes that the true potential of AI lies in basic forms of automation, such as chatbots. He urges business leaders to calm the conversation and to focus on reviewing technological innovation through a strategic lens: what can it do for me now, today? \"It's not all about the corporate singularity,\" says Paul Michelman, series editor for MIT Press's Management on the Cutting Edge titles. \"AI is just the next stage in data analytics.\"</p><p>Computer scientist Melanie Mitchell makes a similar case for sobriety from the coding front lines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans </emphasis>(FSG, Oct.). She aims to provide an antidote to the \"popular schizophrenic relationship to the subject-people tend to be either apocalyptic or triumphalist,\" says FSG editor-in-chief Eric Chinski. Writing from the tech perspective, and speaking with some of the scientists who are knee-deep in this work, Mitchell calls for an examination of ethical issues around AI, such as the expectation of privacy in a world where facial recognition technology is ubiquitous and the morality of allowing drones to make autonomous decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Miami Herald</emphasis> reporter Andr\u00e9s Oppenheimer takes a less prescriptive approach in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Robots Are Coming! </emphasis>(Vintage, May), originally published for the Spanish-language market and translated by Ezra E. Fitz. This international view of AI in action follows the author around the world to places where robots are already at work, from a Japanese automated hotel to a high-tech California farm to Oxford University, where scientists are studying the future of robotics. \"Oppenheimer doesn't take a position with the techno-optimists or the techno-pessimists,\" says Vintage Espa\u00f1ol publishing director Crist\u00f3bal Pera. \"This is a field guide on how to navigate the future.\"</p><p>Notably, each of these authors drives home the point that AI is neither as advanced nor as omnipotent as common wisdom would have it, and that panic may be premature when talking about a technology that can't distinguish a pedestrian from a kangaroo.</p><p>In its most quotidian applications, such as personal banking, AI and automation can be a time and stress saver, according to Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital and former CEO of LearnVest, who tackles automation and personal finance in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financially Forward</emphasis> (Currency, May). Her first book, 2014's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financially Fearless</emphasis>, called for a structured, set-it-and-forget-it approach to saving; the new title helps readers capitalize on digital automation and select a single app to more efficiently manage their money.</p><p>\"It's amazing how much effort and investment in the business world is going into this, and how many entrepreneurs and big companies are getting into this game,\" says Currency executive editor Talia Krohn. \"They're banking on the assumption that people aren't going to be freaked out by the idea that fingerprints are passwords and their banks are on their phones.\" Von Tobel narrows down the options for digital non-natives and others who want simple, safe solutions for money management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B</emphasis> Is for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bitcoin</emphasis></p><p>A number of new releases address the ways in which cryptocurrency is changing finance and urge readers to look beyond their own wallets. These books provide plenty of fodder for the argument that, though the much-hyped bitcoin is little more than a flash in the pan, the impact of blockchain-the peer-to-peer ledger system that bitcoin uses-is here to stay.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Blockchain for Everyone </emphasis>(Gallery, Aug.), John Hargrave, CEO of blockchain content platform Media Shower, offers a guide to investing in blockchain assets. \"Hargrave persuaded me that blockchain technology could be as paradigm shifting as the internet proved to be,\" says Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, executive editor at Gallery. \"I was surprised to learn that cryptocurrency might prove, eventually, to be the first but ultimately least impactful of blockchain's applications.\"</p><p>This is because a \"totally decentralized market\" is on its way, says Mike Henton, who edited Thomas J. Anderson's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Money Without Boundaries </emphasis>(Wiley, Aug.). \"Now that the dust of the bitcoin craze is settling, we're thinking about the behind-the-scenes implications of blockchain.\"</p><p>Readers looking for an insider view of some key players in cryptocurrency will find it in Ben Mezrich's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bitcoin Billionaires</emphasis> (Flatiron, May). It follows the story of the Winklevoss twins, who famously got shut out of the Facebook fortune-as detailed in Mezrich's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Accidental Billionaires</emphasis>, which was the basis of the 2010 movie <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Social Network</emphasis>. Left scrambling, they became early investors in bitcoin and later, Mezrich writes, were its first billionaires. \"People remain fascinated by the enigma of Facebook,\" says Flatiron editorial director Noah Eaker. \"But when the Winklevosses were on the losing end of their fight with Zuckerberg, they had to hustle. They took risks others didn't. And they got rich.\"</p><p>The Puppeteers</p><p>Silicon Valley risk takers such as the Winklevosses figure into several forthcoming titles, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> (Penguin Press, July), which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis>'s starred review called \"a must-read for anyone interested in how a one-horse town birthed a revolution that has shifted the course of modern civilization.\" Historian Margaret O'Mara tracks the evolution of the epicenter of American tech innovation through portrayals of the people who created and grew it, lending a human frame to a business that often seems monolithic and faceless.</p><p>\"Adult supervision seems sorely lacking these days,\" says Penguin Press v-p and publisher Scott Moyers. Books such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis>, he says, \"assure readers that there are wise people at the helm whom they can trust.\" Moyers also acquired the recently released <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coders</emphasis>, in which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wired </emphasis>columnist Clive Thompson delves into the competencies and blind spots of the programmers who are sitting in cubicle mazes right now. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis>'s starred review said the book \"shines a much-needed light on a group of people who have exerted a powerful effect on almost every aspect of the modern world.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financial Times</emphasis> columnist Rana Foroohar, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles-and All of Us</emphasis> (Currency, Nov.), is more blunt: \"Evil was baked into Google's business plan,\" she says. \"Larry Page and Sergey Brin saw the potential for surveillance capitalism in their first paper; titans of big tech have since not wanted to talk about the dark side of their inventions.\" (For more from Foroohar, see \"Defanging the Corporate Beast.\")</p><p>Foroohar calls for voters to force politicians to take a good hard look at how digital wealth should be distributed and what regulations should be put on these companies-a question also posed by Microsoft president Brad Smith in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tools and Weapons</emphasis> (Penguin Press, Sept.), coauthored by the company's communications director, Carol Ann Browne. They assert that large tech corporations should be more open to government intervention and need to embrace regulation before they're forced into it.</p><p>\"These are important communities that are monocultures, which have a fantasy that they're a ruthless meritocracy,\" Moyers notes. By examining their influence, Smith, Browne, and other authors have tapped into the public's desire for transparency about business practices and for privacy protections, and its fascination with the people-with their all-too-human foibles and biases-who have the power to make it happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Liz Scheier is a writer, editor, and product developer living in Washington, D.C.</emphasis></p><p>Below, more on the subject of business and personal finance books.</p><p>Fight the Power: Business and Personal Finance Books 2019<br/>    These titles propose ways to amplify marginalized voices in the workplace, at client meetings, and with investor dollars.</p><p>Defanging the Corporate Beast: PW talks with Rana Foroohar<br/>    Sparked by her child's $900 worth of in-app purchases in a month, Foroohar's 'Don't Be Evil' (Currency, Nov.) delves into how big tech captures and monetizes personal data.</p><p>Deus Ex Machina: PW talks with David Weinberger<br/>    In 'Everyday Chaos' (Harvard Business Review, May), Weinberger explores modern technology's implications for the business world and the ways in which humans and machines, sometimes uneasily, coexist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBWKY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBWKY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-V701-JB5T-52JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404869</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 PWxyz, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Publisher's Weekly</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5977\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 266</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp;

This move would build on the company's initial forays into financial products over recent years. And according to a recent report from Bain &amp; Company, many banking customers are all too ready and willing to ride the wave of disruption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its survey of more than 133,000 consumers across 22 countries, Bain &amp; Company found that more than half of U.S. respondents - and fully three quarters of those age 18 to 24 - are willing to buy a financial services product from established tech players, with Amazon atop the list of the most trusted. Apple and Google round out the top three.</p><p>This finding may be surprising to the traditional banking industry, which bet on nimble fintech startups as the likely disruptors. However, it is increasingly clear that established technology firms could pose the bigger threat. Fintechs may have innovative products, but they struggle to build brand recognition or a distribution model that attracts many customers. Large technology firms already have established brands and customer access, which provide an almost unassailable distribution advantage.</p><p>According to Bain &amp; Company, Amazon is well positioned to succeed in U.S. banking because of its frequent purchases and customer reviews; a full commercial relationship including credit card on file; integration into consumers' computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs and home audio devices; excellent service, including a great returns policy; and no major security breaches so far. No other technology firm, at this time, can claim all of these advantages in the U.S.</p><p>\"Amazon's interest in banking is something we've anticipated for a while,\" said Gerard du Toit, who leads Bain &amp; Company's banking and payments sector in the Americas. \"Checking and debit accounts are notoriously unprofitable, especially for a fee-free model aimed at younger customers, who often have little money to keep in the account. Most banks don't relish serving this part of the market. But Amazon has a number of good reasons to dive in. Its incremental costs to do so will be almost nil and it stands to benefit in ways that go far beyond making money on bank accounts.\"</p><p>Amazon can afford to go after this previously unprofitable segment in part because it can transform the economics of banking; Amazon does not have the burden of an expensive branch and contact center network - which Bain &amp; Company estimates comprises roughly 40 percent of a typical North American retail bank's costs. The company can also avoid a lot of the customer acquisition costs borne by most direct banks, because it already has digital relationships with so many Americans.</p><p>Amazon can also avoid dealing with bank regulatory compliance or managing the balance sheet.

This move would build on the company's initial forays into financial products over recent years. And according to a from Bain Company, many banking customers are all too ready and willing to ride the wave of disruption.</p><p><br/>In its of more than 133,000 consumers across 22 countries, Bain Company found that more than half of U.S. respondents - and fully three quarters of those age 18 to 24 - are willing to buy a financial services product from established tech players, with Amazon atop the list of the most trusted. Apple and Google round out the top three. This finding may be surprising to the traditional banking industry, which bet on nimble fintech startups as the likely disruptors. However, it is increasingly clear that established technology firms could pose the bigger threat. Fintechs may have innovative products, but they struggle to build brand recognition or a distribution model that attracts many customers. Large technology firms already have established brands and customer access, which provide an almost unassailable distribution advantage. According to Bain Company, Amazon is well positioned to succeed in U.S. banking because of its frequent purchases and customer reviews; a full commercial relationship including credit card on file; integration into consumers' computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs and home audio devices; excellent service, including a great returns policy; and no major security breaches so far. No other technology firm, at this time, can claim all of these advantages in the U.S. 'Amazon's interest in banking is something we've anticipated for a while,' said Gerard du Toit, who leads Bain Company's banking and payments sector in the Americas. 'Checking and debit accounts are notoriously unprofitable, especially for a fee-free model aimed at younger customers, who often have little money to keep in the account. Most banks don't relish serving this part of the market. But Amazon has a number of good reasons to dive in. Its incremental costs to do so will be almost nil and it stands to benefit in ways that go far beyond making money on bank accounts.' Amazon can afford to go after this previously unprofitable segment in part because it can transform the economics of banking; Amazon does not have the burden of an expensive branch and contact center network - which Bain Company estimates comprises roughly 40 percent of a typical North American retail bank's costs. The company can also avoid a lot of the customer acquisition costs borne by most direct banks, because it already has digital relationships with so many Americans. Amazon can also avoid dealing with bank regulatory compliance or managing the balance sheet. For example, Amazon's retail banking partner would hold deposits, while Amazon would design and manage the customer experience and distribution. Finally, Amazon can make it easy for customers to pay right from that account instead of with their credit cards, which impose fees for each transaction on Amazon or its third-party merchants. Bain Company estimates that Amazon could avoid more than $250 million in annual interchange fees in the U.S. alone. If Amazon delivers a truly breakthrough proposition that they continue to expand, Bain Company believes the company's banking services could gain more than 70 million consumer relationships over the next five years or so years. This would make them the third largest bank in the U.S., with more banking customers than Wells Fargo. 'Amazon stands a very good chance of succeeding in banking, by disrupting the industry as it has in retailing,' said du Toit. 'Customers indicate ample willingness to buy financial products from technology firms, and Amazon has earned their trust more than most other tech firms. It also possesses all the essential ingredients: digital prowess, a large customer base, an organization skilled at delivering pleasant customer experiences, and ample leeway to extend the brand into banking.' Once Amazon establishes a co-branded basic banking service, Bain Company expects them to move steadily but surely into other financial products including lending, mortgages, property and casualty insurance, wealth management and term life insurance. E-shopping patterns already tell Amazon what it needs to know about customers' life events, from getting married to having children to buying a house, which will be useful for offering relevant financial services products. The company could also add banking services in markets beyond the U.S., such as India and Mexico, where more than 80 percent of survey respondents said they would buy banking products from a technology player. To raise their competitive game and stave off incursions by big tech firms, retail banks can learn from Amazon in three critical areas: First, banks should get serious about putting customers first, meeting their needs in innovative ways rather than pushing products. Second, they will have to learn to move much faster, discarding decision making by committee. Third, they can use new distribution channels by partnering with technology firms, so that they can improve their capabilities in data science and experience design.

Fintechs may have innovative products, but they struggle to build brand recognition or a distribution model that attracts many customers. Large technology firms already have established brands and customer access, which provide an almost unassailable distribution advantage. </p><p>According to Bain &amp; Company, Amazon is well positioned to succeed in U.S. banking because of its frequent purchases and customer reviews; a full commercial relationship including credit card on file; integration into consumers' computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs and home audio devices; excellent service, including a great returns policy; and no major security breaches so far. No other technology firm, at this time, can claim all of these advantages in the U.S.</p><p>\"Amazon's interest in banking is something we've anticipated for a while,\" said Gerard du Toit, who leads Bain &amp; Company's banking and payments sector in the Americas. \"Checking and debit accounts are notoriously unprofitable, especially for a fee-free model aimed at younger customers, who often have little money to keep in the account. Most banks don't relish serving this part of the market. But Amazon has a number of good reasons to dive in. Its incremental costs to do so will be almost nil and it stands to benefit in ways that go far beyond making money on bank accounts.\" </p><p>Amazon can afford to go after this previously unprofitable segment in part because it can transform the economics of banking; Amazon does not have the burden of an expensive branch and contact center network    which Bain &amp; Companyestimates comprises roughly 40 percent of a typical North American retail bank's costs. The company can also avoid a lot of the customer acquisition costs borne by most direct banks, because it already has digital relationships with so many Americans. </p><p>Amazon can also avoid dealing with bank regulatory compliance or managing the balance sheet. For example, Amazon's retail banking partner would hold deposits, while Amazon would design and manage the customer experience and distribution.</p><p>Finally, Amazon can make it easy for customers to pay right from that account instead of with their credit cards, which impose fees for each transaction on Amazon or its third-party merchants. Bain &amp; Companyestimates that Amazon could avoid more than $250 million in annual interchange fees in the U.S. alone.</p><p>If Amazon delivers a truly breakthrough proposition that they continue to expand, Bain &amp; Companybelieves the company's banking services could gain more than 70 million consumer relationships over the next five years or so years. This would make them the third largest bank in the U.S., with more banking customers than Wells Fargo. </p><p>\"Amazon stands a very good chance of succeeding in banking, by disrupting the industry as it has in retailing,\" said du Toit. \"Customers indicate ample willingness to buy financial products from technology firms, and Amazon has earned their trust more than most other tech firms. It also possesses all the essential ingredients: digital prowess, a large customer base, an organization skilled at delivering pleasant customer experiences, and ample leeway to extend the brand into banking.\" </p><p>Once Amazon establishes a co-branded basic banking service, Bain &amp; Companyexpects them to move steadily but surely into other financial products including lending, mortgages, property and casualty insurance, wealth management and term life insurance. E-shopping patterns already tell Amazon what it needs to know about customers' life events, from getting married to having children to buying a house, which will be useful for offering relevant financial services products. The company could also add banking services in markets beyond the U.S., such as India and Mexico, where more than 80 percent of survey respondents said they would buy banking products from a technology player. </p><p>To raise their competitive game and stave off incursions by big tech firms, retail banks can learn from Amazon in three critical areas:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>First, banks should get serious about putting customers first, meeting their needs in innovative ways rather than pushing products.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Second, they will have to learn to move much faster, discarding decision making by committee.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Third, they can use new distribution channels by partnering with technology firms, so that they can improve their capabilities in data science and experience design.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Editor's Note: To arrange an interview, contact Dan Pinkney at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dan.pinkney@bain.com\">dan.pinkney@bain.com</email> or +1 646 562 8102</p><p>About Bain &amp; CompanyBain &amp; Companyis the management consulting firm that the world's business leaders come to when they want results.

As people growing up in the turbulent digital age, college students are at the forefront of a sea of change in the future of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In June, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 passed through the California legislature. The law offers consumers more transparency over the use and transfer of their personal data, including the right to know what types of information companies collect about them, as well as the recipients of that information. A pivotal provision in the bill is the \"private right of action,\" which permits consumer lawsuits in the case of a traditional data breach, such as the T-Mobile data breach in August that exposed the personal information of 2 million people. The law, subject to amendments, will enter into effect in January 2020.</p><p>The legislation, however, is weak compared to the behemoth European Union-sponsored General Data Protection Regulation that entered into effect this May. It gives consumers an unprecedented amount of control over their personal data, how it is used and who is allowed to use it. Crucially, it lets regulators levy massive fines up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of global turnover - whichever is higher - if companies break the rules. Under prior legislation, Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 (about $700,000) for its role in improperly transferring the private information of 87 million users to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm. Under the GDPR, the fine would have been equal to four percent of global turnover, or, put more simply, \u00a31.4 billion (about $1.96 billion).</p><p>Facing these new regulatory threats, tech companies are intensifying legal action within an already massive framework. Facebook, for example, spent more on lobbying in the first quarter of 2018 than ever before, dangling $3.3 million in front of lawmakers to influence policy, according to a Senate filing. Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his colleagues are lobbying Congress to draft a new federal data privacy law, one that would hopefully kill two birds with one stone: erasing the California legislation and putting in place regulations that are friendlier to their data mining practices.</p><p>If we have learned anything from the revelations of Cambridge Analytica, the use of targeted advertising to unfairly influence the 2016 presidential election and the irresponsibility of tech companies that process our personal information, then it is time we call for federal data protection without the outsized influence of Silicon Valley firms. American lawmakers should adopt data protection as a bipartisan priority because the practices of data mining run amok infringe on the liberties of ordinary Americans.</p><p>With the midterm elections fast approaching, citizens would benefit from an overarching data protection law. The need for such a law is evident, especially after a CNN report revealed that Russian-linked Facebook ads targeted residents of Michigan and Wisconsin in key demographic areas during the 2016 election. The anonymous sources in the report indicated the ads filled people's feeds with racially-tinged and anti-Muslim rhetoric. While there is nothing illegal about targeted advertising, when a company like Facebook allows the weaponization of its platform by a foreign government to influence our elections, its apathy is an affront to democracy. In a country built upon the liberty of the individual, tech companies' treating their customers like bottomless pits of data is nothing less than exploitation.</p><p>Lawmakers should thus be skeptical of any proposal floated to them by an industry lobbyist. Facebook lobbyist Joel Kaplan warned the California law could spread to other states and act as a threat to the industry and a regulatory nightmare. To be fair, state legislatures would needlessly torture companies if they each implemented similar-but-not-identical privacy policies. Instead, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association and the Information Technology Industry Council are all pushing for voluntary standards, where the companies would continue to create and enforce their own rules.</p><p>In order to ensure the privacy rights of all citizens, we should no longer accept this monopoly on the control of our data. The days of blind trust in a self-regulatory system for these companies are over, and Congress now has an opportunity to draft federal legislation with teeth to ensure the proper handling of our personal information. Such a law would reform the Federal Trade Commission, which is the current regulatory body tasked with data security. Born in an analog era, it should be reviewed for its efficacy in fighting data breaches in the digital age.</p><p>In addition, while the GDPR is not perfect, representatives in Congress should study its provisions for consumer-centric data policy with a keen eye. The GDPR requires organizations to demonstrate that they process data fairly, openly communicate with customers and employees, and not keep data for longer than required. These are common sense regulations that are missing in the U.S. on a federal level.</p><p>Congress must use the coming months to reflect on our national data security policy. Privacy rights groups in California and lawmakers in Brussels have made great progress toward a fairer alternative to the current situation, where the interests of large corporations prevail. However, there is still a lot of work to be done and firms such as Google and Facebook will fight for every byte of data. I do not attempt to demonize these companies for doing business. In many ways, big tech has improved our lives by connecting people around the world and serving as humanity's largest pool of knowledge. However, their harm to society should not go unnoticed.</p><p>Alexander Satola can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:apsatola@umich.edu\">apsatola@umich.edu</email> \u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3549886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-F6K1-DY7P-T2S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 3, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amidst all of the recent headlines about cybercrime, data breaches and data exposure, it is hard to come to grips with what is actually at stake. These events seem far off and abstract, and the chance of it happening is so slim that it could never happen to you, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some degree, this view is pretty accurate. According to Facebook's second quarter earnings report that came out in July 2018, there were about 2.23 billion monthly average users of the social network. During the recent data security breach Facebookreported to its users this September, the company reset the access tokens for over 50 million affected accounts, as well as 40 million additional accounts as a precautionary measure. The 4 percent of users who did receive a security message should consider themselves unlucky, but on the whole they did not have much to worry about. As of now, Facebookreports that no private messaging was accessed, and no credit card information was stolen. Instead, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the social network developer's application programming interfaces, which allows software developers to tap into Facebook's data. The hackers stole information linked to a user's profile page such as name, hometown and gender.</p><p>Although Facebook's reputation suffered as a result of the incident, Facebookusers like you and I walked away from the incident unscathed and ultimately indifferent. There wasn't a renewal of the #deleteFacebook movement that drew so much attention after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and the coverage on national news networks was overshadowed by updates on the Kavanaugh confirmation. That being said, there is a chance something like this could happen again, and affected users should consider themselves lucky - but not too lucky - it was not much worse.</p><p>Do you have personal information online hackers could use to steal your identity? The answer is probably overwhelmingly \"yes,\" and the fact is this actually happens all the time. The Identity Theft Resource Center reported there were 1,579 data breaches in 2017. In addition, about 14.2 million credit card numbers were exposed in 2017, an increase of 44.7 percent from the year prior, as well as around 158 million Social Security numbers exposed, an increase of over eight times the figure in 2016.</p><p>The numerous data breaches are alarming not only because of the sheer number of people affected, but also due to the high growth rate in the prevalence of such devastating events. Credit card fraud, which usually involves a single credit account, is serious, but identity theft can be much more damaging. When a hacker steals your identity, they can destroy your financial security by opening multiple lines of credit, ruining your credit score and making it nearly impossible to get a loan or apply for a new card. If you are still not convinced data breaches represent a real problem for society, then I have some unfortunate news that may hit close to home. In 2017, the state of Michigan was ranked number one for highest per capita rate of reported identity theft, with 151 complaints per 100,000 residents. If you seek a pleasant peninsula that protects your personal information, look elsewhere (perhaps Florida, which comes in second at 149 complaints per 100,000).</p><p>Do you care about democracy and the upcoming midterm elections? If so, data security is even more relevant to you. Last spring the country was inundated with news surrounding the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and its misuse of Facebookusers' personal information to influence the 2016 presidential election. The researchers at Cambridge Analytica used information gathered from a personality quiz to scrape private data from profiles of people who took the quiz as well as their friends. This data was then used to market sometimes racist, xenophobic and anti-immigrant messages directly to users based on their constructed psychological profile. Facebookpermitted this, and has since shut the service down, but the fact that it was going on at all is cause for concern. The lack of understanding, oversight and control users have over their personal information is nothing but daunting.</p><p>Despite the massive imbalance between big tech companies and us, there are a few ways users can assert a bit more control over their digital presence. The first way is to write to your senator, congressman or elected official to do something about it. As of today, there is no single, overarching data protection legislation in the United States. Instead, data protection is regulated using a tangled web of state and federal laws, with the FTC primarily overseeing \"unfair or deceptive practices\" related to personal information. In response to recent data abuses by Silicon Valley, Senator Mark Warner, D-Va., is fighting vehemently for more stringent regulation for \"information fiduciaries\" who hold large amounts of user data.</p><p>There are also behavioral changes you can make to better secure your accounts. Create a strong, unique password for every new account you make, and change it now and then - wouldn't it be disastrous if one hacked account led to all your accounts being hacked? Take the time to read security alerts. Research a good password manager that can help you stay organized and protect your information. In short, take whatever small steps you can to ensure what you put online is a little bit safer.</p><p>But all of that is up to you. The best case scenario is that you will never experience a hack and enjoy your time on the internet with no problems at all. The worst case scenario is that by 2040 quantum computers will break the internet as we know it and render all of our information totally unprotected. In the meantime, though, let us all make an effort to be more attentive towards our precious personal information so we can enjoy whatever time on the internet we have left.</p><p>Alexander Satola can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:apsatola@umich.edu\">apsatola@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3878717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKS-PP11-JBSN-31F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 28, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has quickly become one of Washington's most prolific social media users, but this weekend the New York freshman said Silicon Valley companies had too much power and that \"the current monopoly trend is societally and economically unsustainable.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ocasio-Cortez's comments came in the aftermath of layoffs at a number of number of news organizations, including BuzzFeed and HuffPost. </p><p>\"The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies &amp; concentration of ownership,\" she tweeted on Saturday, adding: \"The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally &amp; economically unsustainable. We can't simply accept the clich\u00e9 that 'journalism is dying.' Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too.\"</p><p>Since her primary victory, Ocasio-Cortez has shown a remarkable ability to use social media to amplify issues.</p><p>Her comments Saturday are likely to embolden critics -- and dial up the scrutiny -- of social media companies, particularly Facebook.</p><p> Matt Stoller, a fellow at The Open Markets Institute, called Facebook and competitors like Google and Amazon \"extortion machines.\"</p><p>\"[They] have placed themselves effectively as essential communications services that you have to use. Not just as a consumer but as a producer, whether you're producing news or sports or entertainment. Increasingly you have to go through those communications channels to get your product to market,\" Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute told CNN on Saturday. </p><p>That \"essential\" nature, Stoller argued, in combination with a business model that depends on advertiser cash, allows the companies \"to distort the flow of information and grab essentially all of the ad money. </p><p>Facebook owns WhatsApp and Instagram, on Friday The New York Times reported that Facebook plans on further integrating both companies --- despite initial pledges from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to allow both companies to remain largely autonomous. </p><p>In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last week, Zuckerberg defended the model that has made Facebook so powerful, which involves targeting users with advertisements based on their interests. </p><p>Zuckerberg said that Facebook helps small businesses around the world. </p><p>Waleed Shahid, communications director for the Justice Democrats, the group that recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run in 2018, said that taking on Big Tech is one way for Democrats to prove they are committed to combating corporate power. </p><p>\"Breaking up and regulating the Big Tech monopolies will put many of these Democrats in conflict with some of their big money donors --- so it's definitely a way to help prove your grassroots credentials,\" he told CNN on Saturday. \"Democrats need to be leading on anti-monopoly issues in order to put an end to a second Gilded Age for those on top and misery for the rest of us.\"</p><p>Facebook did not comment asked by CNN for a reaction to Ocasio-Cortez's statements. The company recently said it was planning to invest $300 million in programs to help news organizations. </p><p>Democratic Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, backed Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday, tweeting:\"A free, diverse press cannot survive unless we confront the power of Facebook and Google.\"</p><p>But not everybody in Washington thinks the news industry's woes can be attributed to Big Tech. </p><p>In his own tweets about job losses at BuzzFeed and HuffPost on Saturday, President Donald Trump wrote, \"Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. Sadly, many others will follow. The people want the Truth!\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Our biggest grocers have been outspoken critics of how those who undercut the High Street pay pitiful amounts of business rates because of operations run from out-of-town warehouses. </p><p>There is a bigger threat. The digital giants - which were the biggest movers on the US markets last year, advancing 40 per cent with a combined valuation of $5 trillion - are natural monopolists which seek to wipe out competition.</p><p>Amazon's impact on the book trade is well documented.

But he was on the right path.</p><p>Yellen's comments came just days after the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500, two broad indexes of US share prices, hit their highest levels in 15 years.</p><p>Much of the action has been in the tech stocks, with Apple quoted on the New York Stock Exchange valued at \u00a3654billion, or almost half the total size of the British economy. But it has not been alone.</p><p>Older, established tech stocks such as Microsoft have also been roaring ahead, as has Amazon, despite its policy of ploughing almost everything it earns back into the enterprise.</p><p>The big tech stocks have dragged up the smaller Silicon Valley start-ups in much the same pattern as occurred prior to 2000. So one suspects some of the valuations are built on a wing and a prayer.</p><p>There are deep-seated reasons why we should listen to the Yellen wisdom. Having successfully navigated the 'taper' - the end of quantitative easing in the US - without triggering a market meltdown, the next big step for the <person><nameText>Federal Reserve </nameText></person>is the normalisation of interest rates.</p><p>A decision this spring was postponed because of America's weak first quarter, largely weather and oil-related. Nevertheless, the first interest rate increase of the post-crisis cycle gets ever closer.</p><p>Yellen observed that when the Fed does move, long-term rates could move dramatically, and she is trying to ease the passage to the new regime. When share markets are in their recent buoyant mood, as we learned in the period 1996 to 2000, it can be difficult to throw them off-course.</p><p>However, bond rates have come off the bottom with the yield on the ten-year German bund climbing despite earlier concerns that eurozone QE could send them in the opposite direction. Whatever the final outcome of UK elections, there are choppy waters ahead.</p><p>Messi mania</p><p>In the run-up to the 2000 tech boom, BT was seen as a likely British champion, with its domination of domestic telecoms, mobile offshoot O2, Yell, broadband roll-out and the rest.</p><p>It never happened, as the company lurched into financial difficulties, O2 and Yell (luckily) were sold and the share price was decimated.</p><p>Some 15 years on, largely due to the efforts of Lord (Ian) Livingston, it is a different kettle of fish and shares are at a 14-year high.</p><p>It is not surprising now that every part of the business looks to be performing above expectations.</p><p>BT's assault on the sports TV market means it now has 5.2million customers (including Virgin subscribers) and with the help of Lionel Messi, the Champions League and a small surcharge it is aiming even higher. It also counting on Britain's most celebrated yachtsman Ben Ainslie and the America's Cup to bring some extra excitement.</p><p>It is forging ahead with broadband, transferring 266,000 customers to faster internet which means that some 39 per cent of households now have fibre access.</p><p>And it is pushing on with the testing of ultra-fast broadband. BT's own mobile operation already has gathered 50,000 customers before it gets its hands on EE's network - regulators willing.</p><p>It has been quite a journey from the mess left behind by the failed post-privatisation management.</p><p>Bowled out</p><p>Clydesdale and Yorkshire, two venerable names in British banking, are starting to look like the new Co-op Bank.</p><p>Parent National Australia Bank has been seeking to offload them for years, with no success, and is now proposing to dump the banks on the stock market.</p><p>But unlike the dusted-off TSB and the shiny new Metro Bank, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale have been misbehaving and the Bank of England is demanding they find \u00a31.7billion in new funds - to cover future fines and penalties - before the apron strings can be cut.</p><p>And we thought Scots and Yorkshire people were meant to be careful.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-20210563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FXV-9SB1-F021-61YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><timeReceived>8:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Of the latest top changes, the dismissal of Mark Barnett of Invesco Perpetual as manager of the \u00a31.2billion Edinburgh Investment Trust catches the eye.</p><p>The Woodford scandal has acted like an electric shock for a complacent savings industry and the unfortunate Barnett, a former associate of Neil Woodford, has been caught in the aftermath.</p><p>His heavy exposure to big tobacco in the age of environmental, social and governance (ESG) does not fit with the zeitgeist.</p><p>He is replaced by Majedie Asset Management, run by exiles from former Mercury Asset Management. </p><p>The switch at Edinburgh may capture headlines but insurer LV= (Liverpool Victoria), with more than 5m customers, yesterday parted company with its chief executive, Richard Rowney, after 13 years at the helm.</p><p>As a mutual which delights in giving out ESG advice, members might have expected a fuller explanation for a power shift with minimal succession planning.</p><p>If big institutional trusts and investors find it tricky to manage themselves we should perhaps not be surprised by the boardroom chaos of the last 48 hours.</p><p>Accounting and governance issues are at the heart of the wholesale boardroom exodus at M&amp;C Saatchi, which includes founder and inspiration Maurice Saatchi.</p><p>An audit and reporting mess at fashion group Ted Baker saw its veteran chairman and the chief executive head for the door. </p><p>And at transport firm Stagecoach, the founders, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, are marching towards the exit in 2020. The decision to leave the train came amid dipping profits and a failure to renew existing rail franchises.</p><p>The sliding doors show a decisiveness often missing from corporate life, with managers declining to take responsibility for failure and hanging on for dear life. </p><p>A common thread at Saatchi, Ted Baker and casualties such as Carillion, Patisserie Valerie and Thomas Cook is weakness of audit.</p><p>Too often, accountants find themselves under pressure to recognise profits before they arrive, thereby disguising the underlying weakness of reported earnings. </p><p>With disclosure comes punishment in the shape of share price subsidence and a fight for survival and credibility.</p><p>In his desire to radically reshape capitalism Labour's John McDonnell has identified a command and control deficit. </p><p>But his solutions - public ownership and share stakes for the workers - simply transfer the problem from business to Government. </p><p>The core problem has been feeble regulators. Shaking up audit is as good a place as any for the next government to start.</p><p>Former mandarin John Kingman offered the Tories an oven-ready plan with the creation of a new statutory audit, reporting and governance authority. </p><p>The failure to act has been a political own goal and, in Kingman's words, exposed Britain's companies to risks that can only be tackled with legislation.</p><p>If adopted, his proposals might have better inoculated corporate Britain from the crackpot McDonnell threat. </p><p>One chief executive told me yesterday that if Labour gets power he would 'resign and go abroad'.</p><p>Imagine the calamitous impact on output if even a small number of the nation's wealth creators felt they had to do the same.</p><p>Fast food</p><p>The value of robust regulation is demonstrated by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority's decision to lodge objections to Amazon's plan to take a \u00a3436million stake London online food delivery firm Deliveroo.</p><p>Amazon already has best-in-class logistics and one should never underestimate its oligopolistic tendencies.</p><p>It would be a big tech loss to the UK if Deliveroo's algorithms were to fall into the hands of the Seattle behemoth.</p><p>Speed bump</p><p>The German car industry is not quite dead yet. Porsche has taken 30,000 deposits on its fully electric Taycan 4S, due to hit showrooms near you this month.</p><p>The cost? A cool \u00a383,365 for the basic model.

There is a new majority for Democrats in the House of Representatives and a strengthening of the Republican hold on the Senate.</p><p>Much of the focus has been on the capacity of the House leadership to stir up trouble for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>by convening hearings on his tax affairs and other sins.</p><p>But amid the bitterly divided politics, one of the few areas where there is agreement is the need to tackle the omnipotence of the FAANGs: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.</p><p>Trump is no 20th Century trustbuster Teddy Roosevelt. No one is expecting a full throated anti-trust pursuit as when the White House took on the power of John D Rockefeller and Standard Oil of New Jersey.</p><p>Yet in their own way the FAANGs, although much loved by younger technophiles, have much the same market power as Standard Oil when it controlled about 90 per cent of global energy production. Amazon, for instance, has to be held largely responsible for the devastation on the High Street.</p><p>Taming the Silicon Valley giants is a tricky business as we have learnt in Europe. Danish trust-buster <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager </nameText></person>has made a fist of it with her \u00a33.8 billion fine on Google and the contested \u00a311.5 billion fine imposed on Apple for allegedly using Ireland as a tax shelter. </p><p>The EU also has drawn a line in the sand with the irritating, but necessary, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) designed to protect privacy. But Europe is struggling with the idea of a digital sales tax. Initial opposition from Ireland and Luxembourg, where prosperity partly rests on tax avoidance, has won support in recent days from Germany.</p><p>Since such a tax would require assent from all 28 EU members, this European wide levy doesn't look as if it will be happening any time soon.</p><p>So far only the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is showing the backbone to take on the FAANGs, ignoring the fact they have become some of the biggest inward investors in the UK.</p><p>Hammond supports a temporary tax on turnover, to be introduced in the Spring, pending a more sophisticated user charge based around clicks.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>may be a Twitter addict but in the mid-terms he was sharply critical of the power of Google, Amazon and Facebook. The new group of Democrats, taking control of the House and its powerful committees, also are committed to taking on big tech.</p><p>The first line of fire is likely to be political rather than economic. The use of private data during the 2016 presidential election campaign has made an American equivalent of the GDPR attractive.</p><p>It is increasingly likely that the US anti-trust authorities will get in on the act. But the bigger bazooka is held by the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Down the decades it has been responsible for the biggest anti-trust cases - forcing the break-up of AT&amp;T creating a much more competitive dynamic in American telecoms and media.</p><p>The political tides are turning against big-tech both in Europe and the US. The direction of travel, from both a populist White House and frustrated Democrats, is clear.</p><p>The long honeymoon for the FAANGs is over. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-49124608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TPN-2651-F021-60SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><timeReceived>7:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Mr. Jones and Infowars have used social media for years to spread dark and bizarre theories, such as that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Apple made its move on Sunday and the others followed on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The actions, one of the tech companies\u2019 most aggressive efforts against misinformation, highlighted a difficult dilemma for their businesses. They have long desired to combat misinformation online, but they have also been reluctant to be arbiters of truth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But since a rise of misinformation online around elections, such as the 2016 presidential vote, the tech companies have faced increasing calls from lawmakers and the news media to address their role in that spread of false information and a related increase in partisan divisions. The tech companies have recently stepped up enforcement \u2014 but that has led to accusations of political bias, largely from conservatives.</p><p>The moves over the last two days helped fuel that debate. \u201cWhether you like @RealAlexJones and Infowars or not, he is undeniably the victim today of collusion by the big tech giants,\u201d Nigel Farage, a British conservative politician, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1026497409428455427\">said on Twitter</url>. Mr. Farage helped lead the successful campaign for the country to leave the European Union and has been interviewed by Mr. Jones. \u201cWhat price free speech?\u201d</p><p>Apple on Sunday removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app. Commenting on the move, a spokeswoman said, \u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech.\u201d</p><p>Facebook, Spotify and Google\u2019s YouTube site, which removed some Infowars content last week, followed with stronger measures on Monday. Facebook removed four pages belonging to Mr. Jones, including one with nearly 1.7 million followers as of last month, for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d Facebook said the violations did not relate to \u201cfalse news.\u201d</p><p>YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which had more than 2.4 million subscribers and billions of views on its videos, for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.</p><p>Mr. Jones and Infowars are leaders in using the internet to spread right-wing conspiracy theories, an effort that was aided after Donald J. Trump appeared on Mr. Jones\u2019s show during the 2016 presidential campaign and praised Mr. Jones\u2019s reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Mr. Jones has repeatedly claimed that the government staged the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and numerous other mass shootings and tragedies.</p><p>Mr. Jones is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/alex-jones-defamation-suit-sandy-hook.html\">facing defamation lawsuits</url> filed by the parents of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting for claiming that the shooting was an elaborate hoax. Most of Mr. Jones\u2019s conspiracies push a theme that a global cabal of political and corporate leaders run the world\u2019s institutions to brainwash citizens and take away their rights. Mr. Jones partly finances his operation by selling expensive nutritional supplements and vitamins between Infowars segments.</p><p>\u201cTo many, Jones is a bad joke,\u201d said the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut the sad reality is that he has millions of followers who listen to his radio show, watch his \u2018documentaries\u2019 and read his websites, and some of them, like Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, resort to deadly violence.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Jones and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In a message posted on Twitter on Monday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RealAlexJones/status/1026564123314679808\">Mr. Jones said</url>: \u201cThe censorship of Infowars just vindicates everything we\u2019ve been saying. Now, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech? We\u2019re all Alex Jones now.\u201d He railed against the tech companies on his live show on Monday, which was streamed on the Infowars website, saying their moves were part of a leftist agenda in advance of the midterm elections. \u201cI told you this was coming,\u201d he said to viewers.</p><p>The big tech firms that control, via their websites and apps, how much of the world\u2019s media content is distributed have faced criticism in recent weeks for enabling Mr. Jones and Infowars.</p><p>Some tech companies, including Facebook and Google, had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/technology/alex-jones-facebook-youtube.html\">appeared reluctant to remove Mr. Jones\u2019s pages entirely</url> and were instead taking action against specific videos or podcasts. YouTube, for instance, recently deleted four of Mr. Jones\u2019s videos.</p><p>A Google spokesman said on Monday that YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel outright because he continued to flout policies he had already been penalized for violating.</p><p>Mr. Jones had amassed millions of followers, but limiting his influence does not solve the problem of false news. Hundreds of smaller publishers promote similar conspiracy theories, and millions of followers help spread those theories by reposting them. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html\">A new conspiracy theory called Qanon</url>, for instance, has been gaining traction outside of Mr. Jones\u2019s sphere. And Infowars followers can also still repost videos and articles from the site onto YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>But the moves are a significant hit to Mr. Jones\u2019s ability to reach wide audiences, and particularly new followers. YouTube was a particularly important distribution channel, in part because YouTube\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-youtube-drives-viewers-to-the-internets-darkest-corners-1518020478\">recommendation engine</url> frequently surfaced past Infowars videos to users who had shown interest in conservative topics. Terminating his YouTube channel erases all of its past videos and restricts it from posting new ones.</p><p>Mr. Jones and Infowars still have other ways to reach listeners and readers. They have increasingly been directing viewers to visit the Infowars website, which would limit their reliance on the tech companies, presumably foreseeing the bans. Twitter has not restricted the accounts of Mr. Jones or Infowars. A Twitter spokesman said the accounts were not in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules.</p><p>Other tech companies\u2019 approach has been uneven; they have left up Infowars content on some of their services despite removing it from others.</p><p>Infowars introduced a new smartphone app last month that is finding users on Apple\u2019s App store and Google\u2019s Play Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 23rd most popular news app on the Google Play store and the 33rd most popular news app on Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Monday, the Infowars app ranked ahead of apps like BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal on Google, and ahead of apps like MSNBC and Bloomberg on Apple.</p><p>Apple decided to allow the Infowars app on its store after reviewing it, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Google Play Store has different policies than YouTube, a Google spokesman said.</p><p>Matt Rivitz, a freelance copywriter who helps run a Twitter account, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/slpng_giants\">Sleeping Giants</url>, that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/sleeping-giants-breitbart-twitter.html\">pressures companies to distance themselves</url> from far-right groups, said Monday that the tech companies\u2019 nearly simultaneous moves against Mr. Jones proved they were acting in response to public pressure, not new data showing he broke rules.</p><p>\u201cThe timing is very puzzling because he\u2019s been saying this stuff for years and they haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said.</p><p>Conservatives warned that more sites would be cut off soon.</p><p>\u201cTo all other conservative news outlets \u2014 you are next,\u201d Paul Joseph Watson, a right-wing commentator and Infowars contributor, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/1026405120697946112\">said on Twitter</url> on Monday. \u201cThe great censorship purge has truly begun.\u201d</p><p>Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas. </p><p>PHOTO: Alex Jones is being sued for defamation by the parents of Sandy Hook school shooting victims over his claim that the shooting was a hoax.

From what I gather, he's rather out there, taking at face value any conspiracy theory you care to mention and then weaving even larger conspiracies of his own. I gather - I don't know: I've never listened to word one from the guy. </p><p>Basically, the guy is unknown to me. But, a lot of people love him and a lot of people hate himand now he's being deplatformed [1]by the social media giants because he said The Bad Words that the SJW's don't like. None of that is unexpected - and neither is the TruCon, NeverTrump contingent offering a nuanced view which works out to 'it's ok the SJW's got that guy off the web.' In other words, our Muh Principles Conservative betters are eager to surrender to the left, as usual. Lots of heated rhetoric has been issued over this, but anyone with a brain knows what is happening: the left has chosen a marginal case to make their first move into overt censorship of non-left views. It is said that Jones has said some outrageous things, and I'll bet that he has. And for the weak-kneed on the right, this makes it impossible to defend Jones. 'I don't want my Progressive friends thinking I'm like that! Icky poo! Bad, bad Non-Expert!'. But, I'll defend him - I have to. As an individual, what happens to him is unimportant, but as a symbol - and a harbinger - we simply can't let this one slide. If we do, then the left will just go to the next and the next and the next non-left opinion which is 'too extreme' to be tolerated. Eventually, the only non-left opinions allowed will be the tame TruCon surrender-at-all-costs opinions (and don't think this isn't desired by the TruConsits just what they want: all of us gone, them at the top of the Conservative heap, slowly surrendering to Progressive views).  The solution to this is to start putting the regulatory pressure of the government against the social media giants. This is a difficult step for small government Conservatives, but it is a pill we'll have to swallow. The social media giants have deliberately turned themselves into an arm of the political left, and they must be treated as such. My preferred option is to break up the giants into several, smaller and competing entitiesbut, absent that, we need government rules ensuring that everyone has equal access to social media and, so, government prescribed rules for when an account can be deplatformed (you can see why this is my second option: eventually, the left might get the government power to make such rulesmuch better, in my view, to merely have smaller social media companies). For more opinion on this, here's Legal Insurrection[2]. Democrats had been hoping for a special election win[3] in Ohio and got disappointedoutside of the dollop of liberal tears this provided for us, I don't think it means much. Democrats have done very well in the special elections overall, but that doesn't necessarily translate into general election results. Thing about this one - it kinda sneaked up on us. I'm pretty observant about politics, but I don't recall even hearing a whisper about it until special election dayI think the Dems and the MSM (but I repeat myself) were hoping to win this one quietly and then blast it to the rafters as proof that Trump is doomedbut an alert Trump and GOP pounced on it and made sure the GOP pulled out a low-turnout victory.  There's a Twitter account called Sweet Meteor O'Death[4]a satirical account which had its very best days during the 2016 election when it was a candidate for President. Anyways, the account Tweeted out this: Kill all the white people. And all the other people. And everything that's alive. Except deep-sea, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. You get it. I get it. Twitter locked the guy's account for 12 hours. Meanwhile, the New York Times' new columnist's racist rants[5] are still there on Twitter for all to see. Victor Davis Hanson is smart and everyone should listen to him[6]. The thing is that everything has happened before. And if you don't realize that, and also realize that everything can turn on a dime, you'll always end up looking like a fool.

Many have predicted[2] that since 'big tech' has gotten away with censoring Jones, they will use that to censor more conservatives. Now, Jones confronts Marco Rubio and Rubio threatened Jones. </p><p>Infowars' host Alex Jones was on Capitol Hill yesterday, where he delivered a press conference at which he claimed that he had hired 'top lawyers' to prepare a document to explain social media censorship to President Trump and that an executive order regarding social media platforms and digital commons regulation is on the way within the next 'few weeks.' (TRENDING NOW: Nike Promotes Colin 'Take a Knee' Kaepernick, Who Still Claims 'Oppression'[3]) As I have stated before in previous articles, even if you do not like Alex Jones, that is no reason to take away his first amendment rights. He has his own opinions, and he has a right to express them. For all of you out there that celebrate the censorship of Alex Jones, get ready, you are next. Facebook has already started censoring and deleting conservatives off their platform. But we knew this would happen, right? While Jones was on Capitol Hill, he confronted Senator Marco Rubio during a break in the Senate hearings. 'Big Tech companies are purging conservatives, they're shadow banning people in mass,' Jones told Rubio. 'That's weird, man,' Rubio responded adding, 'I just don't know who you are.' Oh, he knows who Alex Jones is, how could he not? Jones has been in the headlines for over a month. His name came up a few times in the Senate meeting, I'm sure. Yet, Rubio played dumb and pretended that he was confused. Let's be honest, if the government wanted to stop the conservative censorship, they could. (TRENDING NOW: Al Sharpton's Trump Bashing at Franklin Funerals, Very Unprofessional[4]) During the confrontation, Rubio got angry and threatened to inflict physical injury on Alex Jones. What are these Senators scared of? Why don't they control this censorship madness? Shortly after, Jones confronted Senator Wyden in the same hallway. 'You guys have dehumanized me.stop violating my First Amendment in those hearings,' Jones told Wyden, who fled. It does seem that the politicians that we the people elect to serve us are good at dodging questions that we the people ask. Jones is right. As previously stated, we don't have to like Jones or listen to his shows, but we do have to respect his rights[5]. This has only opened the door to more conservative censorship. They have already started censoring us. They remove our pages and profiles from their platforms; without explanation. (TRENDING NOW: Tom Fitton: 'Will Hillary Clinton EVER go to Prison?'[6]) This is much bigger than just Alex Jones. If we continue to allow these tech companies to do as they will, there won't be any more conservative voices to listen to. Different opinions are important to our democracy. Democracy has the two wings, the right, and the left. If you take away the function of one wing, the whole country will start breaking down. I thought people like Marco Rubio knew this. Maybe they do know, and don't care. That is even more frightening than if they didn't know. If they didn't know, they can learn, but if they do know and don't care, then we are all in trouble.

So the Silicon Valley big tech companies named themselves the gatekeepers of goodthink, de-platforming anyone who runs afoul of their arbitrary 'community standards.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alex Jones, the host of InfoWars, has often been derided by establishment media as a conspiracy theorist. Yet on Monday, Apple, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook proved right the motto of his show \u2013 \"There's a war on for your mind!\" \u2013 by blocking or deleting InfoWars accounts from their platforms, saying he allegedly engaged in \"hate speech\" and violated their \"community standards.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Simply put, these corporations appointed themselves arbiters of acceptable political thought, and censored Jones for failing to comply with arbitrary political standards set in Silicon Valley boardrooms, not at the ballot box.</p><p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution says that Congress shall make no law \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" There is no \"hate speech\" exemption, either. In fact, hate speech is not even a legal category in the US. However, a chorus of voices all too glad Jones was purged immediately chimed up to argue that Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Spotify are private companies and this does not apply to them.</p><p>There is a wrinkle in that argument, though: civil rights outfits such as the ACLU have argued that social media amount to a \"designated public forum\" in cases where government officials tried to avail themselves of blocking, muting and other functions put forth by Big Tech as a way to police \"toxicity\" on their platforms.</p><p>\"When the government designates social media a public forum, the First Amendment prohibits it from limiting the discourse based on viewpoint,\" the ACLU said in a brief submitted last year in a case before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia. \"When a government actor bans critics from speaking in a forum, it silences and chills dissent, warps the public conversation, and skews public perception,\" the ACLU brief went on.</p><p>In a separate but obviously related case, a federal judge used the \"designated public forum\" definition to demand that President Donald Trump allow access to his personal Twitter account \u2013 not the official @POTUS one \u2013 to critics, because he is a public official.</p><p>Yet if social media platforms are \"designated public forum\" that government is not allowed to exclude people from on First Amendment grounds, how is it OK for corporations that operate these platforms to do so? Or is chilling dissent, warping conversation and skewing perception only bad when a government actor does it, thereby creating a legal system in which the what is irrelevant, and only thing that matters is who/whom?</p><p>There is something deeply cynical about people who until yesterday denounced discrimination and evil corporatism \u2013 and will do so again tomorrow \u2013 suddenly defending private property and freedom to discriminate against political viewpoints. That's because this isn't about principles, but about power.</p><p>Liberals were once all for free speech, starting a movement by that name at Berkeley in the 1960s. Now that the media and academia overwhelmingly march in lockstep with the Democratic Party, however, they're all about \"no-platforming\" opposing views and calling them \"hate speech,\" all in an effort to limit the range of permissible thought and expression in America.</p><p>This has manifested in many forms, from literal riots in Berkeley to \"shadowbanning\" of several Republican lawmakers on Twitter. That platform, which has so far refrained from banning InfoWars, didn't hesitate to block conservative African-American activist Candace Owens after she pointedly echoed the hateful tweets of a liberal journalist hired by the New York Times. Needless to say, the same people up in arms about Alex Jones argued that Sarah Jeong's tweets were fine, because one \"cannot be racist against white people.\"</p><p>This ideological conflict in American society actually goes back for years, maybe even decades. However, the victory of Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, even though most of the media and all of the Silicon valley were #WithHer, flushed it out in the open. Democrats quickly latched onto a claim of \"Russian meddling,\" intended to delegitimize Trump's presidency but also, as it turns out, create an excuse for corporate censorship.</p><p>Consider the November 1, 2017 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where lawyers for Google, Facebook and Twitter were subjected to a barrage of demands to regulate their platforms against \"Russians\" \u2013 or else.</p><p>\"You have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California). She also pressed for removal of RT from YouTube, only to have a Google representative say that despite looking very hard, the company hasn't found any policy violations that would justify such a move.</p><p>\"I'm not really satisfied with that,\" said Feinstein</p><p>Now, imagine how much more chilling this would be if Feinstein represented the ruling party, rather than the opposition. It isn't that far-fetched: during the 2016 election, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta she \"badly\" wanted Clinton to win, while Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, actually spent election night at Clinton HQ with a \"staff\" badge. More recently, this April actually, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called a \"great read\" the article describing how Democrats should fight and win the \"civil war\" currently being waged in the US.</p><p>This isn't about how much one likes or dislikes Alex Jones or InfoWars. This is about corporations deciding for you what you should be allowed to hear, read, say or think \u2013 and the people normally criticizing such behavior cheering it on, because it suits their political agenda.</p><p>As Jones's colleague Paul Joseph Watson put it, \"The great censorship purge has truly begun.\"</p><p>Ask not for whom the censorship bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-122866138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T02-TJY1-F11P-X3HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But a look at InfoWars shows that the conspiracy focused website has many of the same regulations. Deep within the site's lengthy terms of service[1], InfoWars spells out its policies very clearly to potential contributors. </p><p>'We may review and delete any content you post on the Website or elsewhere utilizing our Services or System if we determine, in our sole discretion, that the content violates the rights of others, is not appropriate for the Website,' it reads.

Remember: you are a guest here. It is not censorship if you violate the rules and your post is deleted. All civilizations have rules and if you violate them you can expect to be ostracized from the tribe.' You can read it all right here[3]. On Monday, Apple, Facebook, Spotify, YouTube and Pinterest all moved to effectively ban Jones and InfoWars. Mailchimp and YouPorn[4] joined the club on Tuesday. Platforms cited 'terms of service' violations to remove Jones and InfoWars. 'We have taken [Jones] down for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies,' said Facebook in astatement[5]. YouTube said Monday, in part: 'All users agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines when they sign up to use YouTube. When users violate these policies repeatedly, like our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures, we terminate their accounts.' Jones still has a toehold in the Apple App store and on Twitter, and Twitter has so far declined to take any action against him. InfoWars' No. 2, Paul Joseph Watson, also largely escaped the purge. He still has millions of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter followers as of this writing. In a YouTube video simply called 'Purge,[6]' Watson accused social media companies of 'political censorship.' 'Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube all completely banned InfoWars within 12 hours of each other, clearly suggesting big-tech collusion and proving that terms of service are all bulls-' he said. 'This is political censorship. This is the purge.'

A. Hayek wrote his seminal</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Use of Knowledge in Society, which began:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order? On certain familiar assumptions the answer is simple enough. If we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a given system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of available means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic ... This, however, is emphatically not the economic problem which society faces ... The reason for this is that the \"data\" from which the economic calculus starts are never for the whole society \"given\" to a single mind which could work out the implications, and can never be so given. (1)</p><p>I contest F. A. Hayek's assertion that the conditions for an efficient planned economy can never materialize. On the contrary, I argue that the validity of his claim is contingent upon the state of technology in a given society and the types of socio-technological practices that people engage in. Advances in data processing technologies might render an economic order based on central planning possible to realize and potentially more efficient than a market economy relying on private property and contract exchange. In this Article, I analyze the theoretical preconditions of an efficient centrally planned economy and demonstrate that the theory and practice of contemporary information technology suggest that we might soon be able to meet them. As a result, the argument goes, economic planning--as opposed to a market paradigm--might be worth putting back on the table by progressive economists.</p><p>Consequently, we might soon face a choice between efficiency, welfare, and convenience on the one hand, and freedom and autonomy on the other. In other words, we will need to confront the question: do we prefer the liberal world of contract, property, and market exchange over a world of command and control because we believe it is more efficient, or because we think it is morally superior? As of today, \"both\" is a perfectly good answer. It just so happens that societies that embraced the market paradigm, particularly a highly regulated market with significant wealth redistribution, simultaneously enjoy higher levels of welfare and higher levels of individual autonomy. (2) When, however, planning becomes more efficient (or, put differently, less inefficient) than markets, we will have to choose. A Chicago-style economic analysis of law that asks \"what are the efficient rules of property and contract?\" might soon lead us to answer: \"none whatsoever.\"</p><p>If we do not confront this question, and continue to insist that individual freedom and economic efficiency necessarily go hand in hand, we may move from a market economy to an algorithmically planned economy without making a conscious decision to do so. Not overnight, maybe not even within one generation, but tacitly, step-by-step, the transition will occur. Almost by accident, one could say. Putting forth a general claim about human \"nature,\" (3) hypothesize that a sufficiently large number of individuals could happily give up some freedom in exchange for more welfare and more convenience. In this sense, planning will lead us to some form of authoritarianism, where an entity external to the individual will be telling her what to do and what to consume. However, unlike with the twentieth century's socialist states, authoritarianism will emerge not because the planning will fail, but because it will succeed in delivering more efficient outcomes than markets. Individuals will not be stripped of political and economic freedom; they will voluntarily give it up. (4)</p><p>Before analyzing the normative questions posed by an algorithmically planned economy, I use Part II to outline the history of the idea and practice of central planning and articulate the conceptual differences between a heavily regulated market economy and a centrally planned economy. Part III then describes the historical objections to a centrally planned economy and explains how technological advances might allow its proponents to overcome their critics' longstanding objections. Part IV is a thought experiment: I describe a hypothetical day in an algorithmically planned life. I use this hypothetical to discuss how we might have to normatively decide whether freedom from want is preferable to the freedom of economic choice or vice versa. In Part V, I consider the role of law in facilitating this change of socioeconomic systems. Ultimately, I conclude that the shift to a centrally planned economy will occur only if the law allows it to do so, but law alone is insufficient to prevent the change. By \"allows\" I do not mean \"not prohibiting\" in some public sense, but rather creating institutional frameworks that incentivize socio-technological moves in the direction of central planning. The current legal foundations of the market economy, including almost unlimited freedom to use personal information and directly market goods and services in micro-targeted way, paired with the value of efficiency as the guiding principle for many private lawyers, has set us on a path that might soon render contract and property law obsolete. And, if we believe these changes are normatively undesirable, we should react by putting certain legal constraints in place, or by changing the incentives. More profoundly, however, we should engage in broader cultural and philosophical debates about the relationship between efficiency and convenience on the one hand, and freedom or autonomy on the other.</p><p>Before putting forward the arguments for these claims, let me clarify some concepts I have been, until now, using quite loosely. And let me do so by looking at the history of the idea of the centrally planned economy.</p><p>II THE IDEA AND THE HISTORY OF LIVING IT</p><p>A. An Alien Paradigm</p><p>The twentieth century witnessed a heated debate between proponents and opponents of the idea of a centrally planned economy. This idea was considered a viable alternative to a market-based economy by many intellectuals, including those openly calling themselves socialists, (5) as well as the critics of the \"naturalistic\" approach to the market. (6) The socialist critique of the market economy could be, roughly, equated with socialism's critique of capitalism: a system that alienates workers from their labor and promotes the exploitation of masses by the owners of the capital is socially undesirable. (7) Therefore, it should be replaced by a more equitable economic order.</p><p>What would a planned economic order look like? In a socialist, centrally planned economy, private ownership of means of production would be abolished, alongside the institution of money. (8) Instead of producing \"for-profit,\" the state would manage overall production \"for-use.\" A central planner would decide what should be produced and by whom, in what quantity, and how to distribute it. Individuals, instead of competing with one another and acting upon their greed, would work together towards a common goal, and be appropriately rewarded upon the plan's completion.</p><p>Another objection to the market-based economy, and a non-socialist voice supporting planning, was offered by Karl Polanyi in The Great Transformation. (9) Polanyi argued that, contrary to common belief, markets are not natural and have in fact been artificially constructed through the state's legal action by the creation of \"fictitious commodities\": land, labor, and money. (10) Polanyi supported this view with historical and ethnographic evidence, effectively claiming that living in a market society runs against human nature. (11) According to this view, planning does not need to be \"central\" for the whole nation-state. Smaller communities can plan their economies and trade only with one another outside of the day-today production and consumption by the people.</p><p>The socialist and anthropological critique of a liberal market economy was based on an accurate diagnosis of the problems caused by laissez-faire capitalism and rapid industrialization of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The exploitation of workers, poor working and living conditions of the masses, as well as the feeling of social inadequacy of farmers turned into factory workers overnight, were real challenges. (12) These problems prompted reactions on the intellectual level, most notably that of Marx (13) and Engels, (14) the societal level, through labor movements and several political revolutions, and the political-legal level, with the social turn. (15) However, the responses to these challenges could have taken shape either by rejecting the market-based economy and instead embracing central planning, or by regulating the market, which still would remain the core of the economic order.</p><p>In the West, the second strand prevailed. In Europe, social democracy, largely influenced by the ordoliberal thinkers of the Freiburg school, (16) and Christian democracy, influenced by the Catholic social teaching of the popes rejecting both unchecked liberalism and communism, (17) ended up being the intellectual and political underpinning of the post-World War II welfare states. In the United States, this role was played by the ideology of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal; a progressive assault on laissez-faire economic policy and an attempt to save capitalism by partially taming its excesses. (18) Governments in the West accepted the market as a necessary, often naturally occurring, mode of allocating resources and began treating private property and freedom of contract as obvious institutions. Any corrections to the distribution of resources resulting from this spontaneous order--even significant ones in the form of social security benefits, public healthcare, pensions, or other public services--would be exceptions or additions to the rule of the market. The debates between proponents of state intervention and laissez-faire--that is the debates that we currently see between \"the left\" and \"the right\"--took place within this paradigm, according to which market exchange is natural and necessary.</p><p>In the meantime, east of the Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union and its satellites embraced central planning. The Central Planning Board of the Communist Party would issue a plan (usually every five years) which specified the quantity of production in various sectors of the national economy, from mining to manufacturing to infrastructure construction to agriculture. Then, publicly-owned enterprises were charged with realizing that plan, and workers--who were under an obligation to have an occupation, and who needed the state's permission to change occupation--were encouraged to meet, or even exceed, the production norms. Labor stopped being a commodity traded on the market; freedom to start one's own enterprise was abolished, and the ownership of the vast majority of means of production was concentrated in the quite visible hand of the state. Even in these centrally planned economies, the states retained money as both a store of value and a medium of exchange, did not abolish private ownership of chattel, and to a small extent tolerated private ownership of land. However, the ability to acquire goods was not fully determined by the money an individual possessed, but rather by the authoritative allocation of goods in certain areas, as reflected in quotas and official coupons. No large-scale private ownership of the means of production, like land or securities, ever emerged. (19)</p><p>This approach was therefore not a correction of liberalism, but a fundamental rejection of the market. In other words, market elements such as private ownership and contracting were corrections of planning, not the other way around. The socialist countries of Eastern Europe embraced a different paradigm of economic order--an economy based on a political plan--that is so alien to us nowadays.</p><p>B. Regulation and Redistribution versus Planned Economy</p><p>A terminological clarification might be in order now. There is a significant difference between state intervention in the market and state abolition of the market. (20) It is possible to have a heavily regulated, heavily taxed economic order, where large-scale redistribution takes place and numerous social services are provided, that is still a liberal market economy. This paradigm is not a planned economy.</p><p>A planned economy is an economy where activities of individuals result not from their decision to engage in them, but directly from the command of a legitimate entity, such as the government. In such a system, individuals engaging in production and consumption do so in response to legitimate normative orders or instructions. Regulation, within the market paradigm, sets the rules of the game for choosing and bargaining. Redistribution, within the market paradigm, equalizes the opportunities available to players, or corrects the outcomes of the game. Planning gets rid of the game entirely.</p><p>Another way to explain the difference is to refer to Ronald Coase's distinction between markets and hierarchies. (21) In The Nature of the Firm, Coase theorized two types of economic organization: the price mechanism, and direct control of a superior over the worker. (22) His question was: what explains the choice to create firms as opposed to doing everything through markets, or outsourcing certain activities from a firm to the market? (23) His Nobel-Prizewinning answer was simple: transaction costs. (24) If it is cheaper and more efficient to plan, we create a firm. If it is cheaper to contract, we deploy markets.</p><p>A worker within a firm, instructed by a manager to do something, does not bargain with her--he follows. Different divisions of the same firm do not compete against one another--they cooperate. Conceptually then, a planned economy would be just one, enormous firm, where everyone does what the manager of the economy tells them to do.</p><p>One might contest these distinctions and point to the fact that for many individuals, past and present, the freedom of choice is illusory. One could argue that many contracts are actually coerced--imposed upon people by social realities. That a worker accepting a low paid, dehumanizing job in an Amazon warehouse does not freely accept it. She may be forced to accept it by the need to provide for her family, equally unattractive offers on the job market, or the unfair education system that rendered her less educated than others. All of these objections carry some truth. (25)</p><p>There is a difference, however, between a system that endows an individual with normative freedom to choose her life path without providing the means necessary to exercise that freedom, and a system questioning the very idea that individuals decide their own life paths. The first one is an unfair liberal order. The second is planning. (26)</p><p>C. The Critiques and the Defenses of a Planned Economy</p><p>Not many criticized the socialists for identifying that the market economy risked creating and exacerbating inequality and exploitation. Likewise, few criticized the socialists' ideals: prosperity and non-dominance by the capital owners. Criticism has been directed instead towards the means of achieving that goal. Central planning, in particular, has received two lines of criticism: deontological, that is, invoking human dignity and liberty; and consequentialist, that is, concentrating on efficiency and the chance of realizing it. Hayek, in fact, accounted for both:</p><p>Liberalism ... regards competition as superior [to planning] not only because in most circumstances it is the most efficient method known but because it is the only method which does not require the coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. It dispenses with the need for 'conscious social control' and gives individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages connected with it. (27)</p><p>In other words, there are two reasons to prefer a market economy over a planned economy: it is morally superior on account of respecting individual autonomy and freedom, and it is more efficient, creating a bigger pie and distributing it more fairly. (28) For Hayek, it seemed incontestable that both hold at the same time. Let us take a closer look at each.</p><p>A deontological critique of planning would concentrate on the fact that property is a natural right of every individual (29) and depriving her of the private possession of goods and land runs against the fundamental rights of persons. (30) Similarly, freedom to choose one's occupation, freedom to contract about one's time and possessions, and freedom to choose one's way of life, are incompatible with the idea of central planning. (31) Once the planner steps in--the critique would go--individuals are stripped not only of property, but also of choices regarding their preferences about small and large issues in their lives.</p><p>A consequentialist critique, on the other hand, would underline the negative consequences of attempting to build a centrally planned economy. The common conviction here has been that the endeavor would be impossible to realize, would be inefficient, and would lead to disastrous effects, including mass poverty and social frustration. The most familiar argument for that claim was offered by Hayek in The Road to Serfdom. (32) Read together with The Use of Knowledge in Society, (33) this critique could be summarized as follows: efficient planning is impossible because it presupposes full knowledge about the availability of goods and means of production, as well as individual preferences. This knowledge is local, distributed in the minds of individuals themselves, often incomplete, constantly changing, and as a result, impossible to aggregate.</p><p>Since planning would fail--the argument continues--impoverished and frustrated individuals would start questioning the system. The system, if it wished to preserve power, would need to silence these voices and keep social unrest in check, inevitably leading to some form of authoritarianism. Hence, the deontological and consequentialist critiques come together.</p><p>Others highlight that even if central planners could successfully aggregate all necessary data, the algorithm for state-wide distribution would be extremely complicated. (34) Further, even if we could have such an algorithm, we would not have workforce sufficient to compute it. (35) Finally, even if we did, the question of how to get from these results on paper to the actual social ordering remains unanswered. (36) As a result, the critique goes, planning is less efficient than markets at best, and impossible to realize at worst. (37)</p><p>These criticisms resulted in theoretical responses from socialist economists. Most famously, Lange proposed to use computers to fulfill these tasks. (38) In his view, the problem was not theoretical but practical--the task might be hard, but not impossible. (39) Eventually, technological progress would render theoretical possibilities a reality. (40) Lange acknowledged the moral value of markets in determining how goods and wealth should be distributed. However, since the operation of markets comes with social and individual costs, he believed that we do not really need to live in the market and suffer all the negative consequences--we can just simulate them. (41) In 1936, he suggested the trial and error approach to different ways of conducting central planning, (42) and thirty years later he argued that, thanks to computing technology, we might receive the benefits of markets without bearing the costs. He wrote:</p><p>The market mechanism and trial and error procedure proposed in my essay really played the role of a computing device for solving a system of simultaneous equations ... Such an electronic analogue ... simulates the working of the market. This statement, however, may be reversed: the market simulates the electronic analogue computer. In other words, the market may be considered as a computer sui generis which serves to solve a system of simultaneous equations ... The market may be considered as one of the oldest historical devices for solving simultaneous equations. (43)</p><p>Note that, to Lange, individual preferences and choices did matter. There is value in letting people do what they want and rewarding them with what they enjoy for their labor. However, as is clear to us and was clear to Lange, only very few individuals actually enjoy significant freedom in choosing: individuals are limited by resource scarcity, market inefficiency, and inherent market unfairness. Knowing what resources are available, and what individuals' preferences are, might allow us--through trial and error--to simulate the market. We could then arrive at a more efficient allocation than the market itself, respecting individual preferences to a no lesser degree. Computers would make this possible.</p><p>That was the theory.</p><p>D. Capitalism Wins, but Things do not Unfold According to the Plan</p><p>The debates between market economy supporters and planned economy proponents were not resolved by scholarly philosophical or economic theorizing, but rather by history itself. The market paradigm prevailed. Both those advocating for liberty and those praising efficiency could proclaim themselves victors.</p><p>All the attempts to construct centrally planned economies failed. The Soviet Union and the \"Second World\" of the Eastern bloc bled out. Inefficiency, poverty, and authoritarianism followed all the communist attempts to replace the markets with planning, from Havana to Pyongyang. (44) At the same time, Western capitalist societies thrived. Not without problems, definitely imperfect, but superior to planned economies regarding wealth, efficiency, creativity, and freedom. As the Eastern bloc crumbled, liberal, capitalist democracy seemed like the best way to go. Welfare states looked like a solution to the problem of social costs of markets. Clearly, there were political decisions to be made regarding the amount of taxation and redistribution. But the paradigm of the market as a tool for organizing the economy, even a highly regulated one, seemed uncontestable. Fukuyama published the (in)famous The End of History? (45) Hayek looked like a prophet: the largest economic experiment ever conducted proved his theory was right.</p><p>A rapid westernization of the Second World followed--a transition to capitalism and a market economy, and the construction of the institutions necessary for the market's operation. From Tallinn to Tirana one could see the emergence of central banks, stock exchanges, privatization of public property and companies, and liberalization of the laws governing the economy. On the global level, the world of the 1990s became smaller, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade morphed into the World Trade Organization, (46) trade thrived, Ricardo smiled in his grave, (47) automation continued. Quite rapidly, economic thinking converged: one no longer found books on \"economics of capitalism\" and \"economics of socialism,\" but simply \"economics.\" Young economists in the twenty-first century often do not even read Hayek. The field has completely internalized the core of his theory. The debates we have, even the heated ones, all take place within the market economy paradigm.</p><p>Nevertheless, in 2020, few share the optimism about the inevitable progress of the economy and political freedom that prevailed thirty years ago. In the West, social inequalities are on the rise, (48) the glass ceiling seems thick, (49) and the amount of low-paid jobs is not shrinking, unlike the middle class. (50) On the political level, reasons for optimism do not abound, either. \"Authoritarianism\" is a strong word, but we hear it often uttered in and about Trump's United States, as well as Turkey, Hungary, Poland, and Brazil, and of course Russia. (51) The United Kingdom struggles to leave the European Union. (52) China serves as proof that political freedom does not necessarily follow economic freedom. (53) Amidst weather anomalies caused by climate change and global warming, we try to understand the changes around us, and we desperately try to think of a way of stopping, if not reversing them.</p><p>At the same time, we witness significant technological innovations. (54) The proliferation of personal computers and smart devices connected via wireless networks has led to countless online services. Communication, shopping, banking, dating, reading news, and many other mundane activities are now mediated by technology. The line between being online and offline is getting blunder. (55) All this triggers changes in social life and simultaneously documents them.</p><p>Suddenly, almost everything we do leaves a digital footprint. Every move online, and often offline, creates valuable data. The availability of all this data triggers developments in machine learning and other data analytics technologies. (56) These developments allow us to automate certain tasks traditionally undertaken by humans (for example, translation or spam detection), and in some ways render machines not only much faster, but also more precise, in performing human-experts' jobs (for example, stock trading or cancer prediction). These developments cause excitement on the one hand (57) and concern on the other. (58) We ponder regulation of algorithms, (59) while the extraterritorially applicable regulation of data processing, the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR), has entered in force in the European Union. Theoretical concepts turn into reality, distinct but interconnected with one another: big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, ubiquitous computing, platform and sharing economy--you name it--attract scholarly and public attention. Responses range from policy recommendations and actual regulation, to attempts to understand these phenomena within commonly shared economic and legal paradigms.</p><p>It is worthwhile to reconsider the possibility of realizing the idea of central planning in the light of these socio-technological changes. I contest Hayek's claim that data necessary for conducting the efficient planning can never be given to a computer, or a network of cooperating computers. Hayek's imagination was limited by the then-existing level of technological development. I claim that central planning might be practically feasible, and more efficient than markets, in the decades to come.</p><p>III THEORETICAL PRECONDITIONS AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION</p><p>A. How Close Are We?</p><p>Let us re-consider the objections against the feasibility of an efficient planned economy:</p><p>1. It is impossible to aggregate the knowledge about available means of production and individual preferences;</p><p>2. Even if one did collect this knowledge, we would not have an algorithm for the resource allocation;</p><p>3. Even if we had the algorithm, we would not have the power to compute it;</p><p>4. Even if we computed it, there would be the problem of turning the plan into reality.</p><p>I address them one by one.</p><p>First, the problem of knowledge collection. Let us assume that every individual carries a device through which she can communicate--in real-time--information about her preferences, wants, and available resources. Such a device would need to have an interface enabling individuals to do so, and would need to be connected to the network aggregating the knowledge from all the devices in the economy. Ideally, some of this data collection would occur in the background, without requiring individuals to always consciously act. Moreover, such devices would need to enable the individuals to provide feedback--rating or reacting to various experiences--in order to keep their dynamic and changing preferences updated. In 2020, this problem does not exist. A significant majority of the American population uses internet-connected smartphones daily, (60) relies on social media giving them ability to rate almost everything, (61) and receives personalized commercial and political communications based on revealed knowledge and ratings. Moreover, with the advent of ubiquitous computing and the so-called Internet of Things, a significant number of household and industrial appliances, from cars to fridges to warehouses to electric grids, contain computers measuring their performance and communicating with one another without direct human commands. (62) In 2020, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon know more about individual preferences than do the individuals themselves. (63) We can collect and aggregate these data.</p><p>Second, the problem of the allocation-algorithm. All these data, one could argue, could be aggregated, but there is no way to understand it; nor to derive any prescriptive value from it. The first objection no longer holds. Advances in big data analytics technologies, like machine learning, demonstrate that machines are extremely efficient at detecting patterns in enormous datasets. (64) Advances in mathematics allow us to reason with incomplete data and approximations and still achieve results superior to those achieved by humans. (65) The impossibility of deriving prescriptive statements from descriptive data is a greater potential problem. However, the organizing value--efficiency--is not found in data, but rather assumed by the system. If our goal is an efficient allocation of resources, and we possess all the data about the available means of production and individual preferences, techniques like machine learning enable us to arrive at the optimal allocation. Remember that, to a large degree, what we want to do is to simulate markets' operation; or rather execute the same computation that the market executes, just in a less costly way. (66) We can design the allocation-algorithm.</p><p>Third, the problem of computing power. The power of individual computers doubles every two years (67) (anecdotally, each iPhone has a higher computing power than all the computers used by NASA to land on the Moon combined (68), and their sheer quantity of computers is rising as well. Moreover, we no longer assume that it must be a single computer performing all the operations. In 2020, with technologies like cloud computing and network-computing, the division of labor between thousands of client- and server-devices is a reality. We can compute this equation.</p><p>Fourth, the problem of fulfilling the plan. Let us assume that we know the optimal allocation of resources. How do we get from the plan to the actual allocation? First, the ability of individuals and organizations to communicate in real-time seems uncontroversial given the current state of technology. The problem of physical allocation remains. But here, too, technology is advancing. Soon, fleets of un-crewed vehicles like drones and self-driving cars might be able to transport people and goods around. Already in 2020, thanks to tracking devices in shipping companies' cars, and apps like Uber or Lyft, more and more data about efficient ways to allocate transport-resources becomes available. (69) We can realize the plan.</p><p>All this suggests that, as a theoretical matter, more efficient economy-wide resource allocation can be possible when we rely on central planning rather than on markets and individuals contracting.</p><p>If we can allocate resources more efficiently through a plan rather than using market mechanisms, why not consider doing so? This type of economic planning does not need to immediately replace all market structures. We could start with some sectors, where the efficiency gains could be the highest, or where the social costs of market operations seem the most undesirable. Arguably, in many sectors--like public healthcare, subsidized agriculture, and military spending--the economic models already resemble command and control much more than actual markets. Moreover, organizations already increase their ability to operate based on data, and continuously collect feedback. (70) These characteristics would facilitate a smoother transition to a planned economy.</p><p>One should remember that this type of economic planning does not need to be conducted by the state; nor does it need to be conducted \"centrally,\" if by \"centrally\" we understand this to mean that one entity makes all the decisions. The power to command and control could reside in private entities or a network of public bodies and private organizations. Further, under certain conditions, political decisions about allocation would take place only at the stage of designing or re-assessing the algorithmic allocation system which, once operational, would make decisions autonomously based on the data inputs.</p><p>B. If We Are So Close, Why Are We Not There?</p><p>One could object at this point by stating that the world sketched above is a piece of science fiction, so detached from reality, that any serious engagement with it is unwarranted. But this technology already exists. So why do we still live in a market economy?</p><p>First, the technology that would enable a planned economy is relatively new. And yet, the impact it has had in less than one generation is incredible. Google was launched in 1998, (71) Facebook in 2004, (72) the first iPhone sold in 2007, (73) and the first Uber ride took place in 2010. (74) In the meantime, reliance on these apps and services has increased exponentially, while the ability of these companies to aggregate \"knowledge of time and space\" and compute big data is constantly rising. When speaking of data companies and the planned economy, we are clearly too early into the process to claim that anything is impossible.</p><p>Second, and profoundly, merely thirty years have passed since the West defeated the Soviet Union and its satellites in the Cold War. \"Planned economy,\" especially in Eastern Europe, remains synonymous with poverty and authoritarianism--no one wants that, and so no one is trying to achieve it. (75) At least not under that label.</p><p>Third, I am not claiming to prove that a centrally planned economy might achieve higher levels of efficiency than the market. However, I do believe that all the consideration up to this point warrants treating such a possibility not only as an interesting thought experiment, but also as a variation of a problem that, as a society, we might potentially face. Why would this be a problem? Apart from efficiency, there is one other reason to prefer individual property, contract, and markets over planning. Freedom.</p><p>IV LIVING A CENTRALLY PLANNED LIFE</p><p>One could try to imagine a planned economy from the perspective of society or the perspective of an individual. In the following Part, I do the latter and sketch a picture of a person living a centrally planned life. The story has a dual purpose: to illustrate how such a world could look, and to prepare the foundation to analyze the interplay between the human condition and the tension between choosing and having things planned for oneself.</p><p>A. A Thought Experiment</p><p>Imagine you wake up to an alarm-clock tune that makes you happy and at the time that renders you refreshed and well-rested. You picked neither the tune nor the hour; an algorithm did, based on data about you and millions of others. You take a shower and put on comfortable and good-looking clothes. You are not sure how they got into the wardrobe, and at this point you no longer care. In the kitchen, a pre-cooked, drone-delivered breakfast waits for you. Exactly what you feel like eating. Your smart device tells you when the electric car will pick you up, and what work you will perform today. In the workplace, you feel challenged, but not exhausted. Lunch is great; you eat what you like with the people you find amusing. At the end of the day you go on a date with a person that you have never met. You go to see an interesting movie, then enjoy a delicious dinner, none of which you chose. Why do you and your date have so much in common? Why is this such a perfect match? These questions do not cross your mind anymore. Most of the time, it is a perfect match.</p><p>Every now and then there are glitches, of course. That is why you are asked to rate as many experiences as possible and to provide feedback along various dimensions. This feedback is taken into account. Too much salmon? The next day you dine on beef. Feel like listening to music instead of watching movies? There are live concerts. No longer enjoy the job you are doing this month? There are plenty of other things you can do. Feeling creative? Today you will be innovating. Too tired of thinking? Sure, oversee this production line.</p><p>You can express discontent as much as you like; we will make sure your life improves. You get what you want. To a degree. Sometimes, you get things you never even knew you would enjoy. There are, of course, things you cannot do. You cannot take two weeks off and fly to the tropics more often than once every few years. Then again, no one you know can do that. And from what you learn about history, most people could have never done that before, either.</p><p>Still, sometimes, you are given a choice. Tell us, what would you like to eat today? How would you go about solving this problem? What movie to see? Whom to meet? You enjoy choosing, but only for a while. It turns out that choice is tiring, and the outcomes are always less satisfying than when you simply rely on the planner. At some point, you stop taking the risk.</p><p>Who makes all these plans? Who is \"we\"? From the phenomenological perspective, this is of secondary significance. What matters is that this does not have to be the government. This coordination could be conducted by a private firm, or a network of private firms, or a mix of both private and public entities. (76) Moreover, the granularity of decisions undertaken by the planner can also range from micro-management on the human level to general goal specification, further realized by the machines.</p><p>B. The Choices We Make About Making Choices</p><p>Libraries are full of life-descriptions written by the people who lived under communist dictatorships. Accounts of fear, food shortage, and general misery have been given by many inhabitants of the Second World in the twentieth century. (77) From this Article's perspective, those accounts do not present philosophical problems. Without question, these circumstances were terrible, morally flawed, and should be unequivocally condemned and warned against. However, when one imagines a pleasant and satisfying life in a planned society, the moral significance of the trade-off between efficiency and freedom becomes salient. Do you prefer choosing everything in your life and more suffering; or choosing less in favor of a more convenient existence? Does your answer change depending on whether you struggle to pay the rent or struggle to choose what academic paper to write next? If you could vote for one or another, what would you vote for?</p><p>Clearly, individual preferences will differ, and there is no right or wrong answer. In this regard, people are different. Some people like more choices, some like less. Some like shopping, some do not. Some enjoy browsing catalogues for hours, some find it extremely tiring. There are people who detest having a boss, and some who are terrified with the idea of having to decide everything themselves. Similarly, there will be people who like the choices and risks associated with markets, and people who will like the idea of freeing themselves of these choices. (78)</p><p>However, as a society, through our laws and political decisions, we do make choices about the overall answer to this question. The current debate about the future of the American healthcare system is one example. Is there value in people choosing their plans, even if some will choose to hurt themselves, and some will remain uninsured? Perhaps our society would be better off if there was less choice, but everyone's health expenses were covered. Food regulation is another example. Should people be free to eat unhealthily and buy cheap and tasty products, even if their health will deteriorate and place burdens on others? Or will we outlaw certain choices? Those are all public law examples. But markets in 2020 provide examples as well.</p><p>Arguably, our everyday life features more planning than we realize. Personalized ads and recommendations are one example. When searching for an iron or blender on Amazon, the user will see \"Amazon's choice.\" This choice results from feedback provided by other users, and what Amazon knows about the individual shopper. Clearly, an individual can choose something else. But will they? Similarly, vacation advertisements are fine-tuned based on individual preferences and the availability of transport and lodging. Another example is the omnipresence of boilerplate contracts, whereby consumers essentially never bargain for the terms of contract or specifications of products and services purchased. Moreover, we witness a gradual move from the ownership model of music, videos, and cars, towards a subscription model of Spotify, Netflix, ZipCar, and Uber. (79) Is it better to invest upfront and own all the consequences, or to pay a small fee regularly, and only use when needed? Is it better to read reviews and compare product specifications, or to rely on the algorithmic suggestion? Again, individuals' choices and preferences will differ in this regard. However, their actions and professed goals might not always perfectly align (as I explore in the next Part).</p><p>Imagining a planned economy takes these questions a step qualitatively further. Instead of fine-tuning the choice architecture in which individuals still make decisions, (80) we take the choice away and outsource it to the planner.</p><p>C. The Human Condition and the Planning Crawling Upon Us</p><p>The question troubling me is: as a society, will we actually get to choose between efficiency and convenience on the one hand, and freedom and autonomy on the other? If we transition to a world other than that of liberal democracy, though a world of material and sensational abundance, will this happen because as a society we decide to do so? Or will it happen without anyone's conscious choice about the structure, unnoticed, step-by-step?</p><p>This question should be taken up consciously, by a polity. Yet, I fear that it will not. Planned economic order could become reality not only as a result of political decisions, but also could slowly crawl upon us in a world governed by the alliance of nation-states and big tech multinationals. Having our lives algorithmically planned for us could, at some point, lead to more efficiency, more wealth, more convenience, and more pleasure, at the cost of personal liberty. This would be in line with the changing nature of the twenty-first centuries' authoritarianisms, which do not oppose consumerism or personal wealth, but rather lure people with those things exactly. (81) In this picture, individuals do not have liberty taken away from them; rather bit by bit, they give it up in exchange for easy and pleasant lives. Not at once, maybe not even within one generation, but they do. What would this look like?</p><p>Two distinctions might be helpful at this point: between a marginal cost of every decision seen against the overall structural change, and between short- and long-term preferences of individuals (or maybe better--impulsive decisions seen against the individuals' professed goals). Let us take a brief look at both.</p><p>First, it is possible that every single choice one makes is, in itself, rational, while the sum of all choices turns out to be, in hindsight, very costly and therefore ultimately irrational. Guido Calabresi told me the story of how a century ago, New Haven, Connecticut had the second-highest concentration of houses dating back to the eighteenth-century in the United States. (82) Today, three are left. None of these houses were individually worth keeping. But dozens of rational demolitions led to doing away with something grander that people did not realize was valuable. Similarly, it might be rational to outsource decisions about dietary choices, clothing, entertainment, or employment to the planner. It might make sense, for every single individual delegation, to free oneself from having to deal with some costly decision-making process. And yet, all these delegations might lead to losing something grander--personal liberty.</p><p>Second, it might be even simpler than that. As developments in behavioral and cognitive sciences prove over and over again, individuals seldom act fully in accord with their professed goals. (83) To appreciate this point, consider an individual on a diet, making a decision about whether to eat a chocolate cake or not. He might see the negative effects of eating the cake, seen against the goal of losing weight, already at the moment of the decision. But in this very moment, being tired, and stressed, and hungry, and unhappy, the chocolate cake has all the appeal in the world. Similarly, even seeing the negative long-term consequences of giving up on singular liberties, we might--in the moment of doing so--find small transitions from market to planning too appealing to give up on.</p><p>There exists a certain version of planned economy which necessarily leads to authoritarianism. However, not because it will fail, but because it will succeed. This success will come with many rewards for the individual, but cannot be logically reconciled with certain types of freedoms and life choices.</p><p>The temptation to give up freedom exists. The prospect of releasing oneself from the ability, but also from the necessity, to make choices and to assume responsibility for them seems attractive to some, if not to many. It might not be appealing to you. It might flatly terrify you. Or, you might despise the idea of someone else making such a choice. However, are you certain that all our fellow humans share this opposition?</p><p>If people are forced to give up freedom together with wealth, opportunities, and pleasures, they will fight back. But if people are offered a choice to have less stressful, more convenient, and more pleasant lives--in exchange for losing some liberties--they might be willing to pay that cost. In the end, many individuals could actually be happy in such a world. Unless we believe that a precondition of actual happiness is having an ability to choose, including a right to be wrong and a duty to suffer the consequences of being wrong; unless we believe this is necessary, people could lead happy lives in a planned society, without property, contracts, or markets.</p><p>This account raises two questions: what do I mean by happy and what do I mean by authoritarianism? In the end, is merely having one's needs satisfied enough to be happy? Or, conversely, if the outcomes delivered by the planner align to the highest possible degree with the preferences of an individual, that is, the planned choices mirror the choices the individual would have taken in the world of perfect competition, (84) how is that authoritarian?</p><p>One can tell a positive and a negative story in response. The positive story would stipulate a world in which individuals delegate freedoms regarding the basic needs to the planner, in order to achieve a space and time for the pursuit of the highest modes of fulfillment--quality time with family, intellectual discussions, religious engagement, creation and admiration of art, and so forth.</p><p>The mental and physical faculties currently overtaken by chores, shopping, planning, and overtime-working would be freed. The negative story would, in turn, imagine individuals so deeply immersed in physical sensations, so distracted with the constant, fresh inflow of stimuli causing their brains to release dopamine, that they will never find time necessary to reflect on the lack of liberty in their lives. In order to see that one needs time for reflection to be happy one needs to have time for reflection in the first place.</p><p>Authoritarianism, in my view, has to do with the space individuals have for shaping their preferences themselves. One could imagine feeling happy in the world where one's needs are satisfied, especially if the planner is also in charge of the needs-creation. Just as in Huxley's Brave New World, we could become people conditioned to like what we get. (85) Arguably, we already are conditioned for that along many dimensions, ranging from school curricula to omnipresent ads. However, in today's world, the choice is still normatively ours. Although we might be sliding into one where it no longer is.</p><p>Whether this slide into algorithmic authoritarianism should be allowed to happen is a normative question. I do not argue that such a world is, in principle, immoral. I think it is, but I accept that others might not share my assessment. However, if this happens, this should not happen by accident, as a result of a thousand micro-choices, without the big picture and the long-run in mind. Rather, our society must consciously create the conditions which allow this to happen. This is where one should ponder what roles are played (and are not played) by the law.</p><p>V ROLES (TO BE) PLAYED BY THE LAW</p><p>A. Institutions, Incentives, and Ideas</p><p>The most fundamental claim of Karl Polanyi's Great Transformation is that markets are neither natural nor necessary, and do not arise by themselves. (86) Every community, in his view, has an economy. Not every polity has a market. For markets to emerge, certain legal institutions must be in place. According to Polanyi, this emergence occurrs when three \"fictitious commodities\"--labor, land, and money--are created by law. (87) Legal institutions facilitating trade in land and labor, together with the universal role played by money as a means of storing value and facilitating exchanges, are useful fictions that enabled market-based, capitalist economies to grow.</p><p>If the law provided the institutions for the emergence of the market economy, it has been ideology and material conditions that led people to make use of them in the particular way. Max Weber argues that a fundamental shift in people's way of thinking about a good life needed to occur for capitalism to emerge. (88) Instead of wanting to preserve their way of life, people needed the urge to accumulate resources for accumulation's sake. New industrialists, taking risks to create more wealth than they could ever possibly consume, needed to believe that such an activity is both morally acceptable and, for some reason, desirable.</p><p>The role played by private law is therefore chiefly that of enabling certain social practices, rather than directly allowing or prohibiting, or serving as an instrument for dispute resolution. However, this legal move created the necessary, but not sufficient conditions for the transformation into capitalism. What was missing was the ideological fuel.</p><p>Why does this matter for the question of algorithmic central planning? Two reasons stand out: the law is a source of incentives, and law creates institutions. Regarding the latter, the law might be a source of an ideology, or might be normalizing new ways of thinking, (89) but the changed societal worldview might, and most probably will, come from other places as well.</p><p>Incentives to collect information, cut costs of marketing and production, and optimize processes are inherent in capitalism. The better a firm understands the market, consumers' needs, and competitors' strategies, the higher the chance that firm will make a profit. However, the very existence of this paradigm is predicated on the assumption that--as a society--we are better off with this model of economic activity. In a world in which the goal is efficiency, the market is the first choice only as long as it delivers more efficient outcomes.</p><p>Regarding institutions, one should focus not only on those explicitly created by private law but also those which emerged as part of the social practice in the void created by the law's inaction.</p><p>Consider the right to collect, analyze, and use personal data by online service providers. This data is the source of the potential future planner's knowledge about individual needs and preferences, as well as available means of production and circumstances of time and space. But, it is by no means natural or necessary that companies should be allowed to gather and use all the data about people they can find. Julie Cohen calls this situation a \"biopolitical public domain,\" where whoever manages to capture information about people's lives and experiences is free to use it. (90) In her view, the lack of legal fictions plays a similar role to the creation of the Polanyian fictitious commodities. (91) As a result, as another great book recently put it, we already live in a \"surveillance capitalism,\" where human experience can be traded and \"behavioral futures\"--that is, promises of human behavior to come--become a collateral bought and sold. (92) All this is possible because data can be captured, analyzed, and traded. And in many ways, this leads to more efficient outcomes. Intuitively, the more we know about what people want, the better we can match their needs. We want to match their needs perfectly. Hence, there is an incentive to know as much as possible. And the law, by failing to identify data as a legally-recognized resource, paves the way.</p><p>In addition, the law does little to prevent corporations from shaping</p><p>the preferences of individuals. One of the surprising absentees in the theoretical stable of law and economics is the practice of advertising. We seem to assume that what ads do is, exclusively, to spread information. We police deceptive or misleading ads. In other words, as long as information in ads is not false, there is no claim against the advertiser. However, both the theory of marketing and the amount of money spent on it suggests that more is at play. Ads do not just provide information, they also shape preferences and incentives. In a world where companies are fully free to do so, algorithmic planning (replacing the markets both in the role of shaping preferences and providing supply) is a looming possibility. (93)</p><p>However, just as capitalism was constructed both by legal institutions (commodification of land, labor, and money) and by the shifts in ideology (credited, by Weber, to the theology and practice of certain protestant Denominations (94)), the algorithmically planned economy will emerge within legally enabled frames, but following people's shared ideas of what constitutes a good life.</p><p>What are these ideas and where do they come from? Without claiming to know the answer, I am quite certain that the cult of efficiency is one of them. As of today, this paradigm coexists with the cult of productivity and finding pride in being busy; (95) but this does not have to remain this way. For, simultaneously, we observe the growing importance of entertainment in people's lives. Whether distractive practices like social media, binge-watching Netflix, or the popularization of news delivery and mass culture are responses to people's actual needs, or business models of addiction, the trend of wanting to be entertained continues. Finally, perpetually busy and distracted individuals value convenience to a growing degree, exemplified by one-day Amazon delivery, the booming of food delivery services like Grubhub or Deliveroo, or growing amount of services one can receive right at one's phone.</p><p>With all this in mind, one can wonder how far we are from the world in which individuals themselves will no longer choose and make contracts in a marketplace. Where individual choice is no longer the paradigm.</p><p>I think we are closer to that point than we would like to believe.</p><p>B. What Could the Law Do?</p><p>What could the law do? Note that I do not claim that the world of the algorithmically planned economy is necessarily morally flawed and must be prevented. What I do claim is that we should not end up living in this world by accident. A conscious social decision should be made. As of today, it seems to me, the conditions precedent for the unconscious move to materialize are present. How can the law enable us to make such a decision democratically?</p><p>First, we need to shed light on the data-driven practices of personalized experience. As of today, we understand very little about how the chipping-off of our personal choices actually works. The privacy policies of online companies do not contain enough information to make sense out of their practices. (96) We need better information about the steps taken towards algorithmic central planning. Once we have a better understanding of the preference-shaping activities of corporations, we might be able to see clearly where steps need to be taken to increase private autonomy and where its preservation in the long run might require public-law interventions. (97)</p><p>Second, we need to address an \"elephant in the room\" of private law: the question of the border between information-conferring and behaviormanipulation in advertisements. As of today, the threshold for ads' legality is very low--as long as the information contained is not false, the ads are in principle legal. However, these laws have been written for a world without immediate transactions and without advertisers' ability to continuously collect feedback on each communication's efficacy. Whether the corporate ability to shape consumer preferences and to essentially create demand should be limited is a question that should be reclaimed by political discourse.</p><p>Third, if we do want to prevent (or slow down) the emergence of an algorithmically planned economy, we should ponder various ways of inserting friction into the system. This friction might come from: more stringent regulation of data collection and usage; actively employing antitrust law to promote competition; or simply outlawing certain marketing strategies. In doing so, however, we should be mindful of the regulatory goal--some moves might buy us time without changing the overall course of the society.</p><p>Nevertheless, the law can only provide frames for what will be filled by human nature and culture. The creation of fictitious commodities was a necessary, but not sufficient, step in the emergence of capitalism; (98) certain ideas and material conditions needed to occur. Similarly, for the choice between efficiency and freedom to be taken by society, a sufficiently large number of people sharing ideas necessary to make it must materialize. This role can be played by philosophy, art, religion, and even politics. What I want to do here is ring the bell. Let us see whether it resonates.</p><p>VI CONCLUSION</p><p>In this Article, I have argued that an economic order based on planning might soon be possible and might achieve higher levels of efficiency than an economy relying on private property, contracts, and market exchange. Such a possibility stems from socio-technological changes in our everyday practices, triggered by ubiquitous computing and advancements in data analytics techniques like machine learning. As a result, three issues become pertinent.</p><p>First, when pondering economic and social reform, progressive thinkers should put the idea of a planned economy back on the table. The market paradigm is not the only possible economic order. Algorithmic planning does not have to be conducted entirely by the government, and not necessarily by a single entity. The commands could also be given by a network of public bodies and private firms. Moreover, planning does not have to replace markets in all sectors of the economy. However, in the areas where we can achieve significant efficiency increases--like healthcare, agriculture, and transport--algorithmic economic planning should be considered a viable alternative to markets.</p><p>Second, if an order based on planning could be more efficient than one based on markets, a new normative question comes to the fore: do we prefer liberal economic systems because they lead to more efficiency, or because they enhance individual autonomy? As of today, a tacit alliance of both approaches exists. However, taking a full-fledged pro-efficiency stance might slowly render markets and private law obsolete. If the reason for private property and contracts is efficiency, once it becomes more efficient to plan, no space for markets will remain. Working out the boundary conditions is a central task for normative theorists.</p><p>Third, as a society, we might transition into a world of planning tacitly, step-by-step, without ever making a conscious decision to do so. Such a transition would gradually happen because individuals would freely choose to give up elements of their autonomy in piecemeal fashion. The conditions for this transition are created both by the institutions and incentive structures present in the law, and by the commonly shared ideas about what constitutes a good life. A world of algorithmic central planning would not necessarily be immoral, but this choice is political and should be taken up consciously by the polity. Law provides the framework for such deliberations, but the fuel must come from other social sources.</p><p>PRZEMYSLAW Palka, Research Scholar at Yale Law School (YLS), Fellow in Private Law at YLS Center for Private Law, and a Resident Fellow at the Information Society Project at YLS.

Each company denies interfering with its respective search algorithm, and because of the murky mechanics of how search works, proving the allegations is nearly impossible.<br/>Amazon allegedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345\">adjusted its search algorithm</url> to prioritize       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/amazon-my-face-wash-and-me/597502/?utm_source=feed\">private-label</url> products, which earn the company a higher profit, over items from competitors, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. According to the Journal, Amazon reworked its search tool so that when results are ordered by relevance, items that are more profitable to Amazon appear ahead of items that might be more popular or relevant, but would make it less money. Some of these products include the \"Amazon Basics\" line, with products such as paper towels, batteries, and clothing. Amazon's private-label business represents only 1 percent of its overall retail sales, but engineers said they were pressured by the private-label sales team to emphasize these products in search. The unnamed engineers who told the Journal about the change said they protested it, but were ignored.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/amazon-pays-users-access-browser-data/594199/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What Amazon thinks you're worth</url>]<br/>Amazon admits it takes profitability into account when displaying products, but it denies reworking its search tool to privilege its own products over the competition. In an emailed statement to The Atlantic, an Amazon spokesperson wrote, \"The fact is that we have not changed the criteria we use to rank search results to include profitability. We feature the products customers will want, regardless of whether they are our own brands or products offered by our selling partners. As any store would do, we consider the profitability of the products we list and feature on the site, but it is just one metric and not in any way a key driver of what we show customers.\"<br/>Amazon's carefully worded denial shows how difficult it is to prove that a search algorithm exhibits favoritism or discrimination. Amazon need not include a profitability metric in its formula to increase the profitability of its business. The Journal's report alleges that Amazon's search algorithms instead take into account proxies for profitability. The company makes more money from certain products than others, and if the more lucrative products have something in common (maybe where they're sold or how they're packaged), tracking that variable could theoretically scale with profitability. Engineers told the Journal that Amazon's review committee wouldn't approve any changes to the algorithm unless they also increased profitability.<br/>Amazon is incredibly good at making money, which is why the possibility that it's privileging its own products in its search tool is ringing alarm bells. Amazon controls the marketing, manufacturing, and distribution of its private-label products as well as the marketplace they're sold on. Rigging the search algorithm, if the allegations are true, would only compound its advantages.<br/>Online marketplaces have lately been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-calls-for-breakup-of-amazon-google-facebook-11552065735?mod=article_inline\">under renewed scrutiny</url> from federal regulators, both in the U.S. and abroad, as part of a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/chris-hughess-call-break-facebook-isnt-enough/589138/?utm_source=feed\">larger conversation</url> about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/should-the-us-break-up-amazon/560597/?utm_source=feed\">breaking up</url> tech companies and imposing greater fees for anticompetitive behavior. In 2017, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-slapped-with-2-7-billion-eu-fine-over-search-results-1498556971?mod=article_inline\">European Union fined Google's parent company</url>, Alphabet, $2.7 billion for allegedly pushing independent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pricegrabber.com/digitalcameras/handycam/att/247-221902/more/\">comparison-shopping sites</url> to the second or third page of search results while displaying its own widget at the very top of results. Merchants pay Google when users click on these ads. And earlier this month, The New York Times       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html\">reported that Apple reworked</url> its App Store algorithm to unfairly privilege its own apps, suggesting Apple Music over Spotify when users searched for \"music,\" for example. (Apple denied this to the Times and, in an emailed statement to The Atlantic, reiterated that its algorithm takes a host of factors into account.)<br/>Algorithms interpret potentially millions of data points, and the exact path from input to conclusion can be difficult to make plain. But the effects are clear. This is a very powerful asymmetry: Anyone can notice a change in search results, but it's extremely difficult to prove what caused it. That gives algorithm designers immense deniability.<br/>In 2016, for example,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/\">Bloomberg reported</url> that Amazon Prime was much less likely to offer same-day service to predominantly black and Latino suburbs in Boston and New York. The algorithm that determines eligible neighborhoods, Amazon explained, was designed to determine the cost of providing Prime, based on an area's distance from warehouses, number of Prime members, and so on. That explanation, Bloomberg reported, was a shield for the human designers' choice to ignore how race and poverty correlate with housing, and how that inequality is replicated in Amazon's products.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/discrimination-algorithms-disparate-impact/403969/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When discrimination is baked into algorithms</url>]<br/>Because of their opacity, algorithms can privilege or discriminate without their creators designing them to do so, or even being aware of it. Algorithms provide those in power with what's been termed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/08/facebooks-news-tab-will-be-run-humans-and-algorithms/596554/?utm_source=feed\">\"strategic ignorance\"</url>-essentially, an excuse that arises when it's convenient for the powerful not to know something. The antitrust movement is built on trying to locate humans somewhere within Big Tech's enormous, corporatized systems. Try as companies might to minimize personal accountability, it is humans who build, train, and deploy algorithms. Human biases and subjectivities are encoded every step of the way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-isamazonssearchalgorithmbiaseditshardtoprove598264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-2BH1-JCG7-V0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The People's Bank of China is set to provide its own electronic version of the yuan\u00a0soon, potentially the first major central bank in the world to issue a digital national currency. In doing so, the PBOC is throwing down the gauntlet to Ant Financial's Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat Pay for a share of China's\u00a0$27 trillion\u00a0payments industry. In China, smart-phone-based electronic payments are ubiquitous, used for everything from bus-rides and convenience stores to vegetables at the local market -- and\u00a094% of those transactions\u00a0are controlled by the two firms. </p><p>Yet private-sector primacy in a critical industry is becoming a rarity in China under President Xi Jinping, spelling tougher times ahead for the tech giants. A central bank-backed digital wallet could severely undermine the payments services that are the beating heart of Ant's and Tencent's businesses. \"The central bank is trying to regain the power it lost, as it simply can't allow private companies to dominate payments which lie at the heart of the finance system,\" said Zhu Chen, the founder of Wisburg, a Shanghai-based financial and research consultancy. He forecasts that the PBOC could take as much as a third of the payments business. \"Expect some big blows to WeChat Pay and Alipay,\" he said. Much remains unclear about the threat that the digital yuan will pose to the existing businesses, including the extent to which the public will be willing or required to take it up. Executives from both companies have also not commented on it in public, though Ant Financial\u00a0has worked\u00a0with the regulator on it. The PBOC has yet to set a time-line or plan of implementation, but official speeches suggest it could work something like this: Consumers and businesses would download a digital wallet on their mobile phone and load the token from their account at a commercial bank -- similar to going to an ATM. They then use that like cash to make and receive payments. That's subtly different from the existing mobile payments function, which are essentially processing claims on a bank account much like a debit or credit card. But the state token, if it gains acceptance, would help Chinese regulators maintain a better grasp of the country's money supply. Mobile payments for consumption\u00a0represent\u00a016% of gross domestic product in China, compared with less than 1% in the U.S. and U.K. where credit cards are more popular. As the nation becomes essentially cashless, the authorities have been paying ever more attention to the companies that operate the financial plumbing. \"Those big tech companies bring to us a lot of challenges and financial risks,\" Yi Gang, China's central bank governor,\u00a0said\u00a0during a conference earlier this year. \"You see in this game, winners take all, so monopolies are a challenge.\" Zhu reasons that if Chinese regulators see payments as a sector of vital strategic importance, then the state will target at least one third of market share to achieve control. The usefulness of a payment function to the general public has proven to be so great that both Tencent and Alipay have been willing to pour billions into the business just to win market share. Even though they are inherently loss making -- free to the user but incurring fees from banks -- payment services are a key way to keep nearly a billion people using the apps and available to buy other finance services. Already Chinese regulators have curbed one of Alipay and WeChat Pay's most lucrative businesses - the interest they gain from escrow funds. The PBOC has also reclaimed its authority in the clearing and settlements service, requiring all third party payment systems to connect to a company called Nets Union Clearing Corp. that links with the central bank. That's effectively stopped the duo playing the role of what Yi described as a \"second central bank.\" China's ruling party is adamant about the state controlling key sectors that pose systemic risk -- finance being one of the most important. \"We have to have the borderline between central bank and big tech companies,\" said Yi. Ant Financial, owner of Alipay, and Tencent declined to comment for this story. The PBOC didn't respond to a fax seeking comment on their digital currency plans. It won't be easy to uproot the mighty incumbents though. For years, users have linked their bank saving cards to the apps, which also include a wide range of other useful services, to pay for daily outlays. Alipay and WeChat Pay each have more than 900 million active users in the country. The simple part of the plan is that the token could replace existing cash -- part of an effort to prevent money laundering -- but if the PBOC wants to win more payment share, it will have to build a network where merchants are willing to accept the token directly. That would require a lot of work, said Ryan Zheng, co-founder of RiverPay, which helps Alipay and WeChat Pay connect with merchants. The risk for the PBOC is that adoption is weak, undermining the institution's reputation. That's a concern on the minds of many central banks around the world also grappling with the impact of digital payments and currencies. To listen to PBOC officials though makes it clear that these are just practical considerations beside the bigger themes at stake. \"Currency means interest, power, global politics and diplomacy,\" said Wang In, director of the People's Bank of China research bureau, during a conference this year. \"If a payments tool can provide the function of a currency, then it will definitely have impact on legal tender, and affect how a country manages its currency and financial system.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lulu Yilun Chen &amp;

In the first, a Panorama investigation, Amazon: What They Know About Us, the tech titan and his company were judged by some observers to be data vultures feeding off customers' information, their activities posing a threat to democracy and freedom. One retailer, who alleged his small business was ruined after getting involved with Amazon, even compared the firm to the devil. We saw also a high street bookseller, in tears, locking up her shop for the last time. She could not compete on prices and speed of delivery, so the shop had to close.</p><p>But then there was the other Jeff Bezos, the one who gave $10 billion (\u00a37.7 billion) of his fortune to the fight against climate change. If you have a good idea about how to save this spinning rock from rising temperatures, the Bezos Earth Fund wants to hear about it.</p><p>\"Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,\" the entrepreneur wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p>READ MORE: Before you click think of the damage you are doing</p><p>\"This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs - any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals ... \u2063\u2063\u2063Earth is the one thing we have in common - let's protect it, together.\" Just when you were wondering what you had in common with someone worth $130 billion, along comes the answer.</p><p>So which one is the real Jeff Bezos, a superhero out to save the planet with dollars instead of special powers, or the Jeff Bezos whose company is deemed a threat to democracy and freedom?</p><p>Questioning the motives of those extremely wealthy individuals who give to charity has become commonplace. While praising Andrew Carnegie for giving fortunes away to help and educate others, we nevertheless remember that he made his money through the blood and sweat of workers, as did every capitalist of his age. Many are the universities who have accepted legacies, only to be taken to task generations later by students questioning the morality of how the money was made.</p><p>In Bezos's case, customers have come to look anew at Amazon, and the rest of the big tech companies, and wonder what has been invented on our watch.</p><p>READ MORE: Licence fee 'outdated'</p><p>Yet in most cases the customer willingly gave over the information they now deem so precious. Who put all those personal details into Facebook? Who has ever read the terms and conditions or privacy policy? How many of us have bought an Alexa smart speaker and speak to it more often than we do aged relatives or other members of the family?</p><p>Alexa is a perfect example of our love/suspect relationship with technology and, by extension, those who have made vast fortunes from it. In January it was reported that sales of Alexa-enabled devices had passed the 100 million mark. Though Amazon did not break the total down into its speakers and other products, the extent of the tech revolution that has taken place in our homes is breathtaking.</p><p>I remember when smart speakers first appeared. There was no end to what you could ask Alexa to do, from order dog food to play your favourite music and find out what the time and temperature was anywhere in the world.</p><p>How clever we thought we were, how much time we could save. Then the whispers and doubts began. Sure enough, it wasn't just the machines listening. Humans were doing it as well.</p><p>Big tech said only a tiny fraction of conversations were monitored, and that it was only done to improve the service, but customers were unnerved and rightly so.</p><p>READ MORE: Amazon target site for wind farm plans</p><p>The biggest joke of all was that people had paid for the devices they now accused of infringing their privacy. One former Amazon executive interviewed by Panorama said he still had Alexas in his home but he turned them off if he wanted to have a private conversation. I expect after watching the programme that many more will do the same.</p><p>There is a backlash building against Big Tech, with the race on to see how governments can tax and regulate them better.</p><p>If one was cynical, Mr Bezos's setting up of a $10 billion fund, like Mark Zuckerberg's call this week for greater regulation, can be seen as the tech titans once again trying to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>Doing good things, saying the right things, to reframe the debate in their favour; tinkering at the edges when what they really should be doing is paying more tax, assuming greater responsibility for their actions, and reducing their own carbon footprint. Anyway, how much difference can $10 billion make given the size of the problem faced?</p><p>The Amazon chief executive is not the only fantastically rich person having his actions questioned. Mike Bloomberg, whose charitable giving down the years makes the odd billion here and there look positively peanut-sized, is feeling the heat too, with a rival for the Democratic nomination, Elizabeth Warren, calling him an \"egomaniac billionaire\" and saying it was a \"shame\" he was able to \"buy his way into the debate\".</p><p>It is right to be cautious about where vast wealth comes from and what it is used for, but at the same time we should give credit where it is due. Mr Bezos did not have to offer $10 billion, and his action, together with those of other wealthy individuals handing over enormous amounts, should be welcomed.</p><p>Now about those taxes ...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HRDSCL-18247033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRDSCL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7X-RJY1-JD39-X41S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464262</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"998\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Scotland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2880\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

The chance to hit the lottery is an important part of the Silicon Valley myth.</p><p>As the great bull market reaches new heights, however, this has turned into a gravy train of unprecedented proportions. The reliable profits \u2014 and steadily rising shares \u2014 of Big Tech have removed the risk, turning stock grants into a core part of the annual earnings package for many tech workers.</p><p>The figures have become truly gargantuan. Alphabet, parent of Google, handed out $13.5bn worth of restricted shares to employees in the first nine months of the year \u2014 around $127,000 a head. Facebook went further, with stock awards averaging about $200,000.</p><p>The big run-up in stock prices, led by tech, has supercharged the gains. Workers typically have to wait four years for their restricted stock to vest. Back in 2015, the average value of the stock awards Facebook handed out was $235,000. Now, as they become available for sale, those same shares are worth around $580,000 a head.</p><p>Shareholders have been happy to go along with all of this. Stock benefits have become a worker expectation that no successful tech company can afford to ignore. With a war for talent raging in Silicon Valley, locking in the most valuable workers for four years is critical.</p><p>Also, as share prices have risen across the board, outside investors have been more than happy to turn a blind eye to the handouts that dilute their own stakes \u2014 something that may not continue in a downturn.</p><p>Richer companies have more than enough surplus cash to soak up the effects of this employee stock bonanza. Google, where stock buybacks averaged a modest $6bn over the past three years, ramped up the repurchases to $12bn in the first nine months of 2019. Facebook, which only began to buy back its stock two years ago, repurchased $9bn.</p><p>Life is harder elsewhere. Salesforce, the leader among cloud-based business application companies, is emblematic of the way that stock grants have delayed a move into meaningful profit. It reported $374m in net profits in the first nine months of 2019 \u2014 a period in which it handed out $1.3bn in stock benefits.</p><p>Over time, this has also diluted the holdings of other Salesforce investors, with stock grants being a big factor behind a 40 per cent growth in the company\u2019s share count over the past five years.</p><p>Even for the richest companies, the effects are significant. The value of employee stock is greater than the figures that jump out from a casual glance at the companies\u2019 income statements.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, recorded $3.6bn of stock-based compensation expenses in the first nine months of this year \u2014 which trimmed 24 per cent from its reported profits. But that is only part of the $8bn worth of restricted stock it handed out in the period. The rest has been carried forward, along with stock expenses from prior periods, leaving the company with more than $12bn in charges to be taken against future profits.</p><p>Silicon Valley was up in arms when regulators first forced US companies to start deducting employee stock grants from their profits. Tech companies argued that promising start-ups that lacked the cash to pay big salaries would be dealt a lethal blow if they were penalised for using stock as a lure.</p><p>After the rule change, most tech companies simply added the stock-based compensation expenses back to their earnings, yielding a preferred profit figure they showed to Wall Street. Investors have been more than happy to go along with these (higher) pro forma profit figures.</p><p>For Big Tech, however, profit-enhancing measures like these are no longer needed. In fact, with envy at their huge wealth and market power growing, it probably pays to take some of the shine off the bottom line.</p><p>Two years ago, some of the biggest companies moved in unison to abandon the pro forma figures. Stock-based compensation expenses have sliced more than 25 per cent from reported earnings at Alphabet this year. But it has still been churning out after-tax profits of more than $600m a week.</p><p>So as a bountiful decade draws to a close: Let the good times roll!</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-b838eec0227e11eab8a1584213ee7b2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSP-MS01-DXP9-90F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There have certainly been awkward moments for some of the technically challenged among us, but long after the mud dries on the knees of this year's World Cup Winners, the TVs connected during the event will remain in the living room, blaring out on-demand content.  </p><p>This change will give more New Zealanders access to a wider spread of content options than they've ever had before. But it also puts this country at the centre of what marketing academic Mark Ritson recently tipped to become \"the bloodiest battle in marketing history\".  </p><p>What Ritson is referring to is the fight for supremacy among the tech and media juggernauts all vying for control of the biggest screen in our everyday lives. Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google, Disney and HBO are just some of the players spending a fortune to get viewers locked into their platforms.  </p><p>Pitted against the billions of dollars Netflix or Apple have, local broadcasters face a challenge for relevance unlike anything they've seen since television emerged.  </p><p>All this choice might seem great on the surface, but as more of our daily media minutes are shifted to international providers we'll start to see a number of unintended consequences that could have a direct impact on Kiwi culture.  </p><p>Cookies, diapers and candyAs far back as 2016, a study by Colmar Brunton found that 40 per cent of parents were concerned about the influence of American and international content on their kids.  </p><p>\"We have heard from lots of parents that they want their children to hear our stories. They also want to hear them in our accent and in our languages. It's hugely important to parents,\" TVNZ general manager of product and data Carmen Aitken tells the Herald.  </p><p>Aitken says she still consistently hears from parents who are concerned about kids slipping Americanisms into their daily vernacular, from watching overseas content.  </p><p>A unscientific poll among parents in the Herald newsroom found that words such as \"cookies\", \"candy\", \"diapers\" and \"gas\" have become common replacements for their predecessors : \"biscuits\", \"lollies\", \"nappies\" and \"petrol\". And this is only set to increase, with YouTube steadily dominating screentime among younger viewers.  </p><p>One way to look at this is that mimicry is a normal part of growing up and that children tend to parrot what they see in those around them.  </p><p>Another way to look at it, however, is in terms of the power media have to influence how we behave. This is often referred to as \"cultural currency\", and it plays a big role in terms of defining what we admire and who we look up to.  </p><p>If Kiwi kids are predominantly fed narratives from abroad from a young age, what space does that leave for the local stories and colloquialisms that have been shaped over decades?  </p><p>This is part of the reason why NZ On Air has invested heavily in programming on TVNZ's ad-free children's platform Heihei. The hope being that parents will choose the local option before venturing abroad.  </p><p>The content watched by our tamariki is only part of the complexity we're walking into. Another concern is the way in which data is captured from a young age.  </p><p>Just recently, YouTube was fined more than US$170 million ($271m) for collecting children's personal data while they were watching videos. The problem is that locally we are largely powerless against this until something happens abroad. The giants of the tech world aren't going to change their habits on the basis of what we scream from our corner of the world.  </p><p>At least local broadcasters can be held accountable by regulators and lawmakers here in New Zealand. TVNZ's Aitken says they only capture the name, gender and age of their users and that this information is not shared with any third party advertisers. If in the future TVNZ is caught breaking this rule and misusing data or distributing content that's unsafe for children, we have local measures that can hold them to account.

This ended three days of selling that had helped to push the index to its lowest level since December, 1998. </p><p> Similarly, the Dow Jones industrial average benefited from a typical late afternoon rush of activity, this time on the upside, allowing a gain of 82.55 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 10,290.80 by day's end. </p><p> Meanwhile, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index belatedly joined the party, erasing losses suffered earlier in the day to close up 29.16 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 7,959.46. </p><p> \"The U.S. [indexes] closed at their highs [for the day], so it inspired the TSE to get off its butt and finally move into positive territory,\" said Katherine Beattie, senior technical analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's MMS in Toronto. </p><p>  \"Twenty-nine points isn't a lot, but at least we closed at the high of the day. I think we will continue higher tomorrow.\" But she added, \"it's certainly a very fragile market.\" </p><p> Helping to limit Monday's sudden selloff was the reluctance of mom-and-pop investors to panic and enter the fray. \"A lot of people are simply waiting it out, or they are nibbling,\" said Paul Bates, chief executive officer of Charles Schwab Canada in Toronto. </p><p> In fact, with millions of ordinary investors staying away from the uncertain market, the price swings can become all the more erratic as much of the activity is left to traders and major players, at least one market watcher said. </p><p> \"What we saw was a market that gapped downward [Monday] on little volume, and probably because investors are very much on the sidelines, that's why you get as much volatility as you do,\" argued Bruce Schwenger, president of Bank of Montreal's InvestorLine North America in Chicago. </p><p> The numerous negative earnings forecasts and layoff announcements yesterday, primarily in the United States, also kept ordinary investors at bay. </p><p> In a way, it's a setup that investors created themselves. Demands by regulators and investors that companies provide better public disclosure about their profit forecasts have brought not only more openness, but a barrage of profit warnings that have pummelled individual stocks in recent days. </p><p> Yesterday alone, negative corporate news and warnings of lower earnings came from companies as divergent as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">K</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">mart Corp.</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Club Med</emphasis>. Shares of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harley-Davidson Inc.</emphasis> suffered after it was reported that sales rose 1.9 per cent February. Company watchers had been hoping for at least 10 per cent. </p><p> Yet the market seemed to view each bit of bad news in isolation, acting as though it may be accepting the new culture of greater openness when it comes to earnings forecasts, even if it still got spooked by negative announcements in recent weeks by such big tech names as Nortel Networks Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. </p><p> New regulations, particularly in the United States, \"have mandated full and instantaneous information in an environment where much of that information has been adverse,\" said Thomas Madden, chief investment officer for Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. </p><p> But the market was willing to forgive many of yesterday's announcements so long as the buying momentum continued. </p><p> Also helping improve the mood was the simple fact that many market watchers saw bargains to be had. </p><p> As Tom Galvin, New York-based market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said half-jokingly yesterday, when the prices of once-high-flying stocks get so low that they're the same as your shoe size, that's when \"investors have to stand up and take notice.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illustration</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20010314RWARN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4KY2-F3C0-TXJ2-N2F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Sure, the 2008 financial crisis was an existential threat, but the key to long-term value creation for the Big Four has been an uncomplicated mix of leverage and asset growth powered by residential lending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More recently, though, the game has started to fundamentally change. Even in a best-case scenario, the likelihood of bank mortgage books again trebling in size over the next decade is close to zero, assuming hyper-vigilant regulators were to turn a blind eye. The market growth is simply not there, and capital and liquidity are also constraints.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More importantly, once you throw in the threat from fintech and big tech (Apple, Google and Facebook, among others), a hostile political environment, and profound changes in consumer behaviour and demographics, it becomes clear that business as usual is simply not an option for the $3.5 trillion major-bank industry.</p><p>The flexibility of these massive institutions, which account for 28 per cent of the sharemarket's value, is being tested as never before. The good news for shareholders is that the majors have not been idle in the early phase of the digital revolution.</p><p>Australians now have ready access to funds at all hours of the day and night. They can get home loan approvals in under 24 hours, move money quickly and safely between accounts in real time through the new payments platform, pay for products with a simple tap of a card, smartphone, watch or even a ring on their finger, and have their investment portfolios managed by roboadvisers.</p><p>But this is nowhere near enough to ensure survival. In fact, neobank disrupters believe digital banking has barely scratched the surface.</p><p>Former National Australia Bank executive Eric Wilson, cofounder of the nation's first neo-bank, Xinja - a soon-to-open, 100 per cent digital bank designed entirely for the mobile market - reckons the try-hard banking apps built by the majors are nothing more than digitised versions of analog capabilities.</p><p>\"The future of banking is not a bank delivered via a mobile phone, or a modernised Big Four bank, and it most certainly is not a pretty app flogging an existing legacy bank's products under a different brand,\" Wilson says. \"Every banking model that currently exists in Australia will be extinct or on the critically endangered list within 10 years, and possibly as soon as five.</p><p>\"It's even entirely probable that cash as we know it will be gone in 10 years in many parts of the world. Everything will change, and yet in other ways nothing will change at all.\"</p><p>Wilson is a firm believer in a doomsday scenario in which Xinja will thrive, but others have much more faith in the resilience of traditional banks.</p><p>Former ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith, now chairman of the Melbourne start-up incubator York Butter Factory, has experienced both ends of the size spectrum and believes it's wrong to assume that banks can be easily disrupted.</p><p>\"Beware of the thought that they can, because banks are actually better at this stuff than you think,\" Smith told The Australian after his YBF appointment. \"There are very few industries in the world that use technology like banks do.\"</p><p>Smith's warning is backed by a number of structural advantages enjoyed by the majors, notably their massive 70-80 per cent market share.</p><p>As a result of their size and scope, they benefit from lower operating and funding costs. This is reinforced by vertical and horizontal integration in some markets.</p><p>Potential challengers also have to confront the strong brand recognition and massive distribution networks of the incumbents.</p><p>In 2016, there were more than 5300 bank branches, compared with 470 for credit unions and 76 for building societies, with the majors strongly represented in alternative distribution channels such as the mortgage broking industry.</p><p>While it's true that customers increasingly prefer online channels, the physical presence of the banks helps to reinforce their muscular brands.</p><p>The problem for the banks is that these longstanding barriers to entry are starting to crumble, some of them much more rapidly than others.</p><p>For a start, consumer behaviour and attitudes are changing fast. Gen Y already makes up 22 per cent of the Australian population and will comprise half the workforce in five years.</p><p>Their priorities and preferences are fundamentally different they are rapid adopters of technology, take advice from alternative sources such as social media, and have no patience for cumbersome processes and poor service.</p><p>Loyalty to a financial institution is a thing of the past, with KPMG Australia finding last year that 28 per cent of Gen Y professionals hold financial products with three or more institutions, up from 11 per cent a year before. More worryingly, almost 60 per cent of US bank customers are willing to try a financial product from a tech giant they already use.</p><p>Younger people are even more open to the idea, with 73 per cent of people aged from 18 to 34 saying they would try a tech company's credit card, deposit account, investment or mortgage.</p><p>The message to incumbent banks is that an attractive alternative provider is only a few keystrokes away if the customer experience falls short of the one offered by an Amazon or an Airbnb. It's little wonder a sense of urgency has gripped the centuries-old banking industry.</p><p>At The Australian's Competitive Advantage Forum late last year, NAB chair Ken Henry and his Westpac counterpart Lindsay Maxsted agreed that the next wave of competition would come from outside the industry.</p><p>\"The competitive challenge in our industry is not so much that one of us is going to cut the other's throat. It's not that,\" Henry said. \"It's that we are going to be challenged beyond our ability to cope by the big IT platform providers, the Googles and the Apples and so on.\"</p><p>The race is on to act smaller, simpler and be more focused, with the Melbourne majors more vocal about the scale of their ambitions than the big Sydney mortgage banks.</p><p>Last August, the chief executive of ANZ Bank, Shayne Elliott, unveiled The ANZ Way, a workplace revolution that mimics successful tech companies such as Spotify and Netflix by shaking up cumbersome, bureaucratic processes and adopting an agile approach.</p><p>NAB, for its part, said in November it would cut 6000 jobs, or 18 per cent of its workforce, in three years, while hiring 2000 people with specialist skills for the digital age. The bank wants to build an army of workers skilled in data science, artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.</p><p>Similar programs have been launched at Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, albeit with less fanfare, as the entire sector is swept along in a digital fervour.</p><p>At Commonwealth Bank, 56 per cent of all transactions by value are now digital, up from 47 per cent in mid-2014, with product sales through digital channels spiking from 11 per cent to 29 per cent over the same period.</p><p>Weekly logons to the CommBank app have trebled to 30 million, underpinning $6.1 billion in transactions per week, up from $1.5 billion, while the number of tap and go transactions per quarter has surged from 600,000 to 3.7 million.</p><p>Simplification has become a buzzword as the banks sell peripheral assets, dramatically cut the number of IT applications and rationalise their product portfolios.</p><p>NAB, for example, will have 50 per cent fewer products in three years. Elliott has reinforced the message to his dwindling workforce, stressing that getting things done at ANZ can sometimes be \"really hard\".</p><p>\"Too often we are slow, bureaucratic or we over-complicate things that should be simple,\" he says.</p><p>The burning question is whether this blizzard of activity is going to be enough to allow traditional banks to survive, let alone prosper.</p><p>Peering 20 years into the future, ANZ digital boss Maile Carnegie said in a recent interview with The Australian that she expects to see two major banks instead of the current four, a tech giant or two in the form of an Apple, Google or Amazon, and a handful of fintech companies that have somehow built the stamina and support to last the journey.</p><p>It's a scenario that contemplates a complete upending of the status quo. Momentum for change will start to accelerate once constraints on the power of consumer choice are lifted.</p><p>In a January draft report on competition in the Australian financial system, the Productivity Commission said planned reforms such as open banking, which enables consumers to transfer their data from one provider to another, would provide a powerful spur to competition.</p><p>The PC said the vast majority of financial institutions are using tactics designed to lure new customers and then retain them by exploiting the system's complexity.</p><p>Blockchain also looms as an extremely disruptive technology. Conceived as the structural underpinning of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, the blockchain is easier to imagine as a kind of digital ledger - a spreadsheet that records transactions, agreements, or anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified.</p><p>The big difference is that the ledger is not stored in a single place; it can be distributed across a handful or even thousands of computers around the world. When someone transfers Bitcoin, the transaction is verified by the system, encrypted, and a new line, or \"block\", is added to the spreadsheet.</p><p>Despite Bitcoin's wild volatility, International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde says that it \"may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies\".</p><p>If she is right and cryptocurrencies powered by blockchain do take hold, then the financial system starts to look like a very different place.</p><p>\"It's a world where client data is instantly portable [through open banking], there is no need for a trusted third party to hold your cash [because of cryptocurrencies], no need to pay a clip on transactions [because of the blockchain], and most critically, it's a world where a loan rate can be arbitraged quickly and efficiently,\" Xinja's Wilson says.</p><p>\"There will be major and powerful disruption in the Australian banking industry in the coming years. People will lose their jobs and iconic brands will fade away, but consumers will get better services at much lower prices.\"</p><p>The vision is one where customers are empowered at the expense of institutions, taking control over their data and exercising choice.</p><p>Banks will wither unless they find ways of adding genuine value, because the current approach of selling products and charging fees will not be sustainable.</p><p>In their place, according to Wilson, will be something more like the bank manager of old - a respected figure who guides customers to better decisions and outcomes.</p><p>\"But not a physical being,\" he prophesies. \"Perhaps not 'someone' but 'some bot'.\"</p><p>Richard Gluyas is The Australian's senior business correspondent</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180316DealNSW8000362469022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RW7-WXW1-JD3N-500G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>DealNSW Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001V19</classCode><className>NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAB (ASX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00096SB</classCode><className>CONSUMER BEHAVIOR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000613</classCode><className>ENDANGERED SPECIES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkE4MEQ5MEY5QTY1NDIxMzg4OTcxRTA5OEU2NDhDRUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode><className>Endangered Species Act</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

In simmering battles  over sanctuary cities and border security.  Chief correspondent Jonathan  Hunt joins us now from Los Angeles.  Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  The  alleged killer of Ronil Singh was apparently trying to make a run for  Mexico.  But officers, aided by aerial surveillance, swept into arrest him  in Bakersfield, that's in central California, some 200 miles south of where  the shooting happened.  The arrest came just 48 hours after 33-year-old  officer Ronil Singh was gunned down.  He leaves behind his wife and 5- month-old son.  </p><p>Today, officer Singh's brother broke down as he thanked police and sheriff  deputies for finding the suspect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, OFFICER RONIL SINGH'S BROTHER:  There's a lot of people out  there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't  know that work days and nights to make this happen.  I'd like to thank you  from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  The suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was in the U.S. illegally,  according to the local sheriff, who angrily denounced California's so- called sanctuary laws, which the sheriff said prevented Perez Arriaga from  being deported for previous DUI convictions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, SHERIFF, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  This is a  criminal illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been  reported to ICE.  We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited  because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh.</p><p>I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Officer Singh was shot dead around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning after  stopping a driver on suspicion of DUI.  Moments later, he radioed, \"Shots  fired.  I've been hit.\"  He was a legal immigrant who had come to the U.S.  from Fiji where he was born.

Congress is mostly out of town.  President Trump  is still here, tweeting, quote, \"We will be forced to close the southern  border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to  finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our  country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve.\"</p><p>The president is also threatening again to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala,  and El Salvador, for failing to prevent their citizens from traveling  illegally to the U.S. border.</p><p>The White House and Democrats are a few billion dollars apart on funding  for border security.

Let's bring in tonight's \"Power Panel.\"  Fox news contributor,  Jehmu Greene.  Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto.  And  Fox News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good evening.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I want to play a little bit more of what the sheriff had today  -- to say today about the fact that California has a sanctuary state  policies and it makes his job tougher.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIANSON:  Suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p>Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals?  Gang members.  It's a  conversation we need to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Jehmu, your reaction?</p><p>GREENE:  Well, first, and definitely foremost, you think about the family  and prayers go out to the family, to the community.  And it's really  important I think in these times that you don't use a crime like this to  demonize all undocumented immigrants.</p><p>We want this murderer to have justice that is swift and harsh.  But that  certainly does not mean that there is link of criminality to the rest of  undocumented immigrants, as some -- </p><p>BREAM:  And I don't think anyone is making that suggestion.</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No one's heard that.  Where  did that come from?</p><p>GREENE:  Many Republicans want that to be the case, when the reality is,  undocumented immigrants in this country commit considerably less crimes.   Considerably less crimes than native born -- </p><p>BREAM:  But what we're talking about is this one situation where  apparently, according to the law enforcement officials involved that this  man should not have been in the country.  He had previous DUI arrests.   That he came here illegally.</p><p>So in the case of this family and this slain officer, Gianno, we're talking  about somebody that potentially, the state's on policies allowed this or  cases like this, to happen.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes.  I'm incredibly disappointed with my dear colleague Jehmu's  rhetoric on this issue.  This is a safety issue plain and simple.  It's not  a partisan issue.  If you look at the pure numbers, 74 percent of  individuals that were brought in by ICE.  In 2017, had previous felony  convictions.</p><p>We talk about the sanctuary city status of places like Chicago and the  state of California, which don't provide any funding for those that may be  -- that ICE may want to retain.  They may want to detain those individuals.   They can use any personnel for that.</p><p>So, yes, this is making our country less safe and certainly, this is  something that I said two days ago, on this very network, that Democrats  are going to have to own any criminality that's perpetrated by individuals.   They came into this country illegally because they refused to negotiate  what the president of the United States on border security.</p><p>So when you have a Congress, a democratic caucus who refused to negotiate,  when you have local elected officials who refused to follow the trend of --  if individuals are coming over here illegally and they are doing illegal  activities that could possibly harm U.S. citizens, like we just saw, that  they don't -- they don't buy into that.</p><p>So this is as very problematic.  And, Jehmu, I'm just so surprised and  disappointed with what you said.  I'm sorry.</p><p>GREENE:  Well, Shannon, there's the link right there that Gianno is trying  to make between criminality and undocumented immigrants, that is just not - - </p><p>CALDWELL:  I never said that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  Let me bring Art in here.  Because what we're talking about is --  we're talking about -- we're talking about this case and what clearly  happened here.</p><p>Now, Art, a lot of folks would say, both parties bear the blame.  Both of  them have been in control, at some point, the White House, the Senate, and  House, and have not gotten this fixed.  You know firsthand what's going on  at the border.</p><p>DHS Secretary Nielsen is there today to see for herself.  She's been there  many times before.  But Congress, it's up to them to fix this, regardless  of which party is in control, they don't seem to be able to get it done. </p><p>ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Being an  illegal in this country and the security of our nation's border has nothing  to do with what political party you are in.  First and foremost.</p><p>Now, this is a horrific, horrific incident that happened with this officer  dying, and it is 100 percent because of sanctuary cities.  It is 100  percent because what you do when you have these sanctuary cities is you  create a magnet for these individuals that like to break the law, which,  just by the fact that you're illegally in this country, you're already a  criminal, plain and simple.</p><p>People say, oh, well, he's just illegally in the country, he's not a  criminal.  No.  If he's illegally in the country, that makes him a  criminal.  And it is definitely at the hands of any single individual,  politician, or whoever that maybe that supports sanctuary cities.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, Jehmu, where do we go from here?  I mean, the  Democrats take over the House in January, just a week from now and they've  said the first thing they're going to do is refund the government, they're  not going to have any funding for the wall, so that's going to go to the  Senate.  If it makes it through their, to the president, he said he's not  going to sign anything that doesn't have funding for the wall.</p><p>I mean, where does this standoff end?</p><p>GREENE:  Well, I think one place we could go from here is to revisit some  of the policies that we saw in the Obama administration that were very much  focused on criminals that were here undocumented, and how to put in smarter  policies to target them, to track them, to find them, and to get them out  of the country.  When we look at how this administration is dealing with  immigration and throwing out mothers who have been here for 20 years with  no criminal record, and anyone who they come in contact with, that takes  away the focus.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  They're here illegally.  That's (INAUDIBLE) all on its own.</p><p>GREENE:  And so, yes, it would be -- it would be better to focus on those  criminals and get them out.</p><p>BREAM:  Art, I know you had something to say there.  I mean, this is part  of what you do and being a part of border patrol.  I mean, you've seen this  firsthand.  What's the reality?  Because listen, we know under the Obama  administration, he became known as the Deporter in Chief because they were  turning around so many people.</p><p>It wasn't a positive to a lot of people who supported President Obama, but  we know that these policies of turning people back of denying asylum  claims.  I mean, they aren't new.  Why are they reported and treated  differently now?</p><p>DEL CUETO:  Because these people care more about being angry at the  president than they do about the United States and the American citizens.   That's what it is.  That's the way I see it.</p><p>Look, I have skin in the game.  I'm out there in the field.  I'm out there  arresting some of these individuals, and it's easy to Monday morning  quarterback it, you know, behind a desk, and you know, Far East.  It's easy  to Monday morning quarterback it.</p><p>President Trump has done everything possible to make sure that this country  moves forward and that there's border security.  And that's the reality of  the entire situation.</p><p>He's a president that has reached out to the National Border Patrol  council.  He's on point with everything he says.  And everyone needs to get  on the same page because it's getting frustrating to see so many people  that really don't care about the American public or about our borders,  about border security.</p><p>And even with the shutdown.  I have skin in the game, as I said before.  We  don't know when or if our next paycheck is going to come.  And I've been  misquoted and some of the media, or some of my words have been twisted.   And I can tell you right now, the National Border Patrol Council, which I  am a part of, fully support the president and fully support the shutdown,  if that's what the president is asking for.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Gianno, I want to -- </p><p>CALDWELL:  If I can really quickly jump in there.  I know that you --  really quickly.</p><p>BREAM:  Sure.  Go ahead.</p><p>CALDWELL:  So to your same question to him, the reason why we see like  nothing being done, I think Democrats have seen, especially some of our  Latino brothers and sisters that are coming in, as a power base for them.</p><p>So we think about in 2006 when Senator Barack Obama said on the floor of  the Senate that we needed the Secure Fence Act, which 26 Democrats voted in  favor of it.  Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer himself, they talked about  border security in a positive way back then.</p><p>But now that we see that there is an influx and now Latinos are going to be  the new minority, the new major minority, I think they're seeing this as a  potential power block for them so they might as well support anything  that's going to keep these voters happy.</p><p>GREENE:  That is so false.  That is so false and unfair.</p><p>BREAM:  Gianno, the Republicans have control of the White House, the House  and Senate for the last two years and their base wants to know why they  didn't get something done.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And that -- and that's a -- that's a very good question.  I  think we didn't have enough votes in the Senate to actually get something  passed.  Similar to that, you have to work with Democrats on it.  Think  about what President Trump offered the deal in terms of DACA.  Democrats  didn't even take it, they didn't want to take it off the table because they  wanted to keep the issue alive for the midterm elections and that's exactly  what they did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GREENE:  Jehmu, the President keeps reneging on his deals.  First it was  $1.3 billion for a wall, then it's $2.5 billion for a wall.  With DACA,  he's reneged on so many deals.  If this President is about making deals,  you have to be a man of your word.  He sent Vice President Pence out to  front for him and then reneged on that deal.  How can you get to a place of  compromise and understanding if the President can't even keep his word on  this issue? </p><p>BREAM:  Well, he's -- listen, he's asked for a lot more than that.  He and  now several others in the White House say they are offering compromise  deals, they've heard nothing back and don't expect they will from the  Democrats until Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.  So one week from today, maybe  we'll have this conversation again and see if the government is reopened or  what's happening.  In the meantime, Jehmu, Art, and Gianno, thank you, all.   Appreciate your time.  </p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.  </p><p>GREENE:  Thanks.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The Florida Sun Sentinel publishing a bombshell report  tonight on the Parkland School shooting massacre in February this year.   It's headline this, unprepared and overwhelmed.  The paper goes on to  report the two decades after Columbine at five years after Sandy Hook,  educators and police still weren't ready for Parkland.  Surveillance video  and the reports shows the killer Nikolas Cruz in the beginning moments of  the massacre telling another student, \"you better get out of here, things  are going to get messy.\"</p><p>And pulls out the AR-15 and begins shooting.  The video also shows Deputy  Scott Peterson, the school resource officer, the only armed law man on the  campus as he reportedly -- the paper says, failed to go inside the building  despite shots being fired.  He ordered a school lockdown instead of  ordering deputies toward the building.  Later revealed in this report that  officers \"may rush toward gunfire rather than shout\" according to policy  there in Broward County.</p><p>Well, pushback on one of President Trump's nominees to a key federal agency  by a member of his own party.  We're going to tell you why.  Senator Mike  Lee is trying to block the nominee because of what he says is a religious  freedom issue.  And Tony Perkins, president of the research -- Family  Research Council joins and he's going to weigh in on why this nominee is so  controversial. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Republican Senator Mike Lee is taking a stand against one of  President Trump's nominees to a key Federal agency.  The controversy is  pretty much flown under the radar in the middle of the government shutdown  but for the right and the left, there are some big issues at stake here  from traditional marriage to workplace discrimination.  Correspondent David  Spunt is here to tell us why Senator Lee is blocking his own president --  his own party's nominee.  </p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Shannon, it's a quite a story.   As you know, the EEOC is there to protect people's civil rights in the  workplace and Chai Feldblum, she's not new to the agency.  She's been a  commissioner since 2010, receiving support from both Republicans and  Democrats.  In fact, President Trump renominated her to her post just a  year ago.  Tonight she's defending her name as Senator Lee says, he'll  really do whatever he can do to make sure that she is out of a job.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I object to her confirmation.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Utah Senator Mike Lee is making it clear he wants EEOC Commissioner  Chai Feldblum out over concerns about her stance on religious liberty.  He  is prepared for a fight.  </p><p>LEE:  The Federal government should never, Mr. President, be used as a tool  to stamp out religious liberty.  That principle is so central to our  nation's founding and human happiness itself.  It's so important that we've  got to stand behind it.  Mrs. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly  that.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Feldblum is the first and only openly gay EEOC commissioner who was  quoted in a 2006 article as saying she had difficult time finding any case  in which religious liberty should win over sexual liberty.  Feldblum claims  she was misquoted, and put out this written statement over lee's position.   Senator Lee and others may feel they have kept a rabid opponent to  religious liberty off the equal employment opportunity commission.</p><p>They are wrong.  It is true that they have ensured that someone who cares  deeply about both religious liberty and LGBT rights won't protecting those  interests from the perch of the EEOC.  But I have fought from the civil  rights for LGBT people, religious people, and others for years.  I won't be  stopping now.  Feldblum went on to tell Fox News in an e-mail, Senator Lee  refused to meet with me when I asked to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that is why he does not know what I actually believe.  In 2009,  Feldblum defended religious liberty.  </p><p>CHAI FELDBLUM, COMMISSIONER, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION:  I  also have a deep respect for and understanding of religious practice, and a  deep-seated tolerance for religious difference.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Washington Democrat Senator Patty Murray says Feldblum must be  confirmed for the sake of millions of employees across the country.  </p><p>SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D), WASHINGTON:  Because of the objection of a single  Republican Senator, it is possible now that the EEOC will be unable to  deduct some of its most critical work.  </p><p>SPUNT:  But Lee says he'll continue to fight to protect religious liberty,  a concept he believes the EEOC should welcome.  </p><p>LEE:  Who is she to decide whether or not someone should be permitted to  persist in their own religious beliefs?  Simply because those beliefs  happen to conflict with a particular political worldview?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  And speaking of religious beliefs and an e-mail tonight, Feldblum  told me that her late father was a proud rabbi.  Shannon, he said -- she  said he would be very upset to see exactly the way she is being portrayed  right now in the media.  Especially by Senator Lee with this whole  situation going on.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Well, we'll keep an eye on it because I guess her  commission essentially expires New Year's eve if the Senate doesn't do  something and they're not here, so --</p><p>SPUNT:  They're not here and there's a lot of questions about how the EEOC  is going to operate for those millions of people around the country if she  is not in.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  David, thank you.</p><p>SPUNT:  You bet.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Joining us now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research  Council to talk about this.  Tony, welcome.  </p><p>TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL:  Thanks, Shannon.  Good  to be with you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to play a little bit more of Senator Lee's  critique.  And then some response from the Ms. Feldblum.  So here is the  Senator.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LEE:  Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious  belief and LGBT liberty as \"a zero-sum game,\" where \"a gain for one side  necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.\"  I see no  reason why that should be the case, and I think that's fundamentally  incompatible with our nation's long tradition of pluralism and religious  freedom.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So, Tony, here is her response.  In part she says, it's an out  of context quote that suggests I believe there is a zero-sum game between  religious liberty and LGBT rights.  And that LGBT rights must always  prevail no matter what, that is not my position, and never has been.  I  care deeply about preserving religious pluralism in our country even if  that means protecting religious organizations whose views I disagree with.   That is the point of pluralism.</p><p>OK.  What is getting lost in translation here?  </p><p>PERKINS:  Well, I think we've got to put it into context first and I know  Chai Feldblum.  She actually -- she actually spoke at the Family Research  Council.  I invited her one to come and speak on the panel and she made  comments reflecting this coming collision between religious freedom and  sexual liberty.  And she then suggested that she saw that religious liberty  would lose.</p><p>But she is also the architect of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,  which Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.  Now this is -- this is  literally sacrificing our vibrant first amendment on the altar of sexual  libertinism.  And she was unable to get that through Congress.  So Barack  Obama appointed her to the EEOC.  Couldn't got her -- actually get her  through the Senate when Harry Reid was the majority leader so he did a  recess appointment.</p><p>She was subsequently after Harry Reid changed the rules where only a  majority were need for presidential nominees, so she's been controversial  even to her own party.  She has taken positions that are 180 degrees from  the Trump administration when it comes to religious freedom.  And so it is  -- I applaud Senator Mike Lee, spoken with him a number of times about this  particular case and I applaud him for taking a stand in defense of  religious liberty.</p><p>She reflects an era of the past, the Barack Obama era of hostility toward  religious freedom.  We don't need her on the EEOC leading that commission  forward.  </p><p>BREAM:  But Tony, you know how this works obviously.  I mean, the President  has the opportunity to appoint members, the majority of members, three to  two, so you have five members of the EEOC that represent his majority party  but he goes to the Democrats for their nominations and their suggestions on  the other two members.  She is already a current sitting member of the  commission.</p><p>So he's basically following up with what the Democrats want which is to  keep her there.  Now there is this issue as we talk about with David, that  her commission expires December 31st.  If the Senate doesn't take action  clearly it doesn't appear that there is any way they're going to.  Mitch  McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, could force a vote.  Here is what a  statement from (INAUDIBLE) vice president.</p><p>Here's what they say.  Americans need a fully functional EEOC to combat  discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.  And Mike Lee's  anti-LGBTQ views should not stand in the ways of those seeking justice  under the law.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should abide by set  President and immediately hold a full Senate vote on the EEOC nominees were  fair-minded voices will prevail.  Do you McConnell is going to do that?  </p><p>PERKINS:  No, I don't.  I don't think he should.  First off, we have to  look at what the advantage she has as a returning member of the commission.   I served on the Federal Commission, I know those existing members kind of  influence the new members.  But you have to consider the EEOC is actually  lined up in Federal court against the Trump administration's own Department  of Justice on the redefinition of terms such as sexual discrimination, what  sex means.</p><p>Where -- this is furthering the lawlessness of the Obama administration  where they unilaterally change the terms of the 1964 antidiscrimination law  and civil rights law and the 1974 title VII as it pertains to employment.   They have just unilaterally redefined those terms.  She's doing that by  bureaucratic fiat.  So I think Mitch McConnell would be wrong to move  forward with this.  I think Mike Lee is taking the right position.  I don't  think the President really is pushing this.</p><p>I think you're right.  It was giving the Democrats -- somebody in the White  House said let's just give him what they want.  Chuck Schumer wanted her.   I think she needs to be off the commission.  </p><p>BREAM:  Well, having practiced labor and employment law in the past, I know  exactly how much power the EEOC wields.  And, you know, you have to ask  questions about Congress, about how much power has been delegated to these  Federal agencies because they don't answer to the people, they're unelected  and they do have quite a bit of power.  So, we'll keep an eye on it, we'll  track it and we'll have Senator Lee here in the New Year to come talk to us  about it as well.  Tony, thank you very much.  Happy New Year.  </p><p>PERKINS:  Happy New Year, Shannon.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Up next, big tech is in the crosshairs.  Congress  expected her face off against social media prepping new regulations and  potential oversight on content and privacy when lawmakers get back in the  New Year.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have to put some rules of the road in place.  We - - they can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BREAM:  Plus, a look back at the winners and losers on Capitol Hill.   Congress' 2018 year in review.  Chad Pergram's by the numbers when we  return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  No sign that Congress will vote anytime soon on ending a partial  government shutdown.  Reopening the government will likely fall to the new  congress, 116th, which starts next Thursday at noon.  So, what exactly did  the 115th Congress actually managed to get done?  Back by popular demand,  Fox News Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram is here to break it down  by the numbers.  Chad?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Shannon, 2018 marks  the end of one of those rare times Republicans control the House and  Senate.  So, it's a good time to take stock of what the GOP did and didn't  do.  Take the long the longtime GOP promise to repeal and replace  Obamacare.  After one failed attempt, House Republicans finely muscled  through their own health care measure that then died in the United States  Senate.  Republicans re-engineered to the nation's tax system for the first  time in three decades.  </p><p>GDP topped four percent in the second quarter of 2018 for the first time in  four years.  Yearly, economic average growth is now on track to hit three  percent for the first time in 13 years.  Nevertheless, political observers  blame the tax law for Republicans losing house seats in New York, New  Jersey and California.  Residents could no longer deduct high local taxes  from their federal tax bill.  Congress never addressed an infrastructure  bill.  And there were a failed house bills to fund the border wall and  provide pathways to citizenship for some DACA recipients.  The president  had this message for those Republicans during a press conference in late  June.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think that's going to  be a great election point for us.  So, I told them two hours ago, I said,  you're going to do what you want.  And ultimately, we'll come to something,  and perhaps, it will be after the election, maybe it will be before.  But  as of this moment, Democrats are not going to vote for anything because  they really are resisting or obstructing.  OK?  Thank you very much.  </p><p>PERGRAM:  There were bipartisan successes.  Democrats in the House and  Senate finally got together on a long-awaited reform to the nation's  criminal justice system.  The law eliminates mandatory sentences, give  inmates better training to reenter society ready to work.  Lawmakers  approved a major bill addressing the nation's opioid crisis.  And even  though part of the government is now closed, the Senate moved at its  fastest clip in decades on annual spending bills.  That's why this is a  partial government shutdown.  Congress worked out the details on five of  the 12 appropriations bills months ago.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell often declared that the Senate is in the personnel business.  </p><p>The Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees, including the knockdown,  drag out fight over Brett Kavanaugh, also 32 circuit court judges and 51  district court judges.  We all learned in fifth grade that Congress is  designed to pass law -- quite the opposite.  The founders created Congress  to stop law.  Consider this: lawmakers introduced 13,549 bills this  Congress, 338 became law, that's 0.02 percent.  329 bills became law in the  last Congress.  And one bill, not destined to become a law this Congress  legislation, to fund the approximate quarter of the government now held in  limbo during the spending fight on a border wall.  Shannon? </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much.  We'll see you what  2019 brings.  When it comes to cybersecurity, a year in review might  highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even question  over bias and social media content.  And as Correspondent Gillian Turner  reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and  online security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown is an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.  First up,  regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the  big three social media companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google owned  YouTube.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the road  in place.  They can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p>TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news faster than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on:  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.  </p><p>Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about: data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They're taking  cues from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refuse to  decrypt their data for investigators.  </p><p>\"Companies are in the business of generating profit.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns but it's  important to understand that what's good for a technology company isn't  necessarily good for America.\"  Democrats are focused on protecting  Americans privacy.  They worry if investigators can access any encrypted  data they want, it will lead to abuses in the future.  </p><p>2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.  Breaches  of Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Here's hoping  2019 is more secure.  Shannon?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Sounds good, Gillian Turner, thank you very much.  New laws for the  new year, that's where we're headed in tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"   Starting January 1st, Washington State will begin imposing fines on people  who try to pass off ordinary pets as service animals.  Maximum penalty,  $250.  Meanwhile in California, judges will be able to decide who gets  custody of a pet during a divorce proceeding.  Judges will take into  account who takes care of the pet and feeds them.  </p><p>Tough gun control measures will go on the books in Illinois this year, they  include a 72-hour waiting period on all gun purchases.  Another new law  will allow family members or police to ask a judge to temporally remove  guns from someone they think is a threat to themselves or others.  </p><p>In Tennessee, women will soon be required to get an ultrasound before  getting an abortion.  The doctor performing the ultrasound must also let  the woman know the results of the test, namely whether or not a heartbeat  is detected.  Doctors will also be required to put that information into  the patient's medical records.  </p><p>President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria still being questioned by  members of both parties.  But the president now has an unlikely ally -- a  former high-ranking Obama official.  That story is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.   It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.   But as Lucas Tomlinson reports, the Trump administration's new plan has  support from a former senior Obama official.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Syrian forces move to the  outskirts of a Kurdish-held city captured from ISIS, putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's  forces closed in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal  of U.S. forces from the country.  But the Kurds say, they welcome the  Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion  after their U.S. allies leave.  Turkey's president says, he wants the  Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.  </p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave, then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States with President  Trump, whom I spoke to recently, and Russia, continues healthily.  </p><p>TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out: \"Holding Northeastern Syria would  not have been enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams, can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler  about our abilities, especially in the face of sustained, widespread  regional hostility.\" </p><p>Seven years after the start of Syria civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  The Gulf States are long opposed to his rule are coming  back to Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in  Syria, one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.  U.S. officials  tell me, there's no immediate plans to withdraw any American troops from  Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from a country could take months.   Shannon?  </p><p>BREAM:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon, thank you.  Impassioned pleas for  32 migrants who remained stranded in the Mediterranean, that leads  tonight's \"WHERE IN THE WORLD.\"  The German nonprofit sea-watch making an  impassioned appeal to E.U. states after no European nation agreed to take  in 32 migrants who've been stranded at sea for the past week.  The group  rescued the migrants mainly from Nigeria, Libya, and Ivory Coast, December  22nd, just 24 hours after another group rescued more than 300 migrants who  were eventually taken in by Spain.  </p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  pyramid, killing at least three people and wounding ten others.  The  countries battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack  to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.  </p><p>And Cuban officials are preparing to roll out fresh austerity measures as  the cash-strapped nation continues to experience the weak economic growth,  following export revenue and rising debt.  Cuba's economy has averaged a  one percent annual growth over the past three years.  Foreign trade has  also fallen by about 25 percent during that same period.  </p><p>All right, does buying a ticket to a sporting event give you the right to  cuss out the players?  Well, one fan says, security roughed him up when he  used foul language and he is now taking them to court.  Our legal eagles,  Marjorie and David are standing by to present their cases.  You are the  jury.  \"NIGHT COURT\" is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  It is time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\"  Another rocket docket, we're  going to try to get through two cases here.  First up, a Guatemalan family  suing Universal theme park in Orlando.  They say the park needs more  bilingual signs because the family's 38-year-old father died of a heart  attack two years ago after ridding to the skull island attraction.  The  family says a sign in English warning that it's a ride through Kingkong's  natural habitat and people with heart condition shouldn't risk it.  They  said, well, there wasn't a sign in Spanish.  </p><p>Now, the other case, New York Giants fans suing in a San Jose, California  court for the right to curse at players and flip them off.  These fans say  their First Amendment rights were violated last year by police officers and  security there after they flipped off Giants players and told them they  \"blanking suck\" -- that's a quote.  These are Giants fans, they were angry  that their team was losing.  So, tonight's legal eagles to weigh in and  remember you're the jury: Marjorie Mesidor and David Bruno, thank you both  for joining us tonight.  </p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Hello, Shannon.</p><p>MARJORIE MESIDOR, PARTNER, PHILLIPS &amp; ASSOCIATES PLLC:  Thank you for  having us.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK, because we just showed a little video there.  Let's start with  the Giants case.  They were at the game, they were yelling at their own  players because they were so mad that they were losing this game.  The  police say that they were warned, they need to calm down, quit cursing at  the players, without language, the flipping them off and it didn't work.   They eventually ended up getting arrested.  Let's get into a little bit of  this.  </p><p>A report afterwards, \"The Captain Wahid Kazem of the Santa Clara Police  Department saying this, that Patrick Flynn -- one of the plaintiffs in the  case -- was belligerent, intoxicated and clearly violating the stadium's  code of conduct.  Kazem said that Patrick Flynn and Kyle Flynn, his  brother, had been warned about their behavior, they were being ejected from  the stadium when Kazem said they became uncooperative and physically  resistant.  The officers refused to leave their seats.\"  Marjorie, that's  the one side of the story.  How do you respond?  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Well, when it -- when we're talking about issues of drunkenness  and disorderly conduct and the like, that, in and of itself, there's no  first amendment violation they are.  But if we're just talking about the  speech, whether or not they had a right to flip off to the players, et  cetera, essentially, the First Amendment says that all speech, all those  that don't fall into a particular exception, is essentially protected.  </p><p>They interfered with that speech with the arrest, and essentially you have  to then look at whether or not the limitation of that speech was justified  by the fact that they want a safe environment.  I don't think they're going  to be able to show that it fell into one of the five exceptions of speech  that is excluded from freedom of speech.  It's not inciting a riot, it's  not criminal, it's not criminal speech, it's not obscenity in terms of the  way that the law looks at obscenity.  It's not pornography or any one of  those things.  So, I think that they have a decent case here to say that  there's a First Amendment violation.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK, part of their complaint says this, \"The force used against the  plaintiffs was excessive, unreasonable, without cause and with deliberate  indifference to their health and safety.\"  You saw at one point, one of the  guys flips over one of the railings there.  Plaintiffs suffered bodily  injury, physical pain, emotional distress and deprivation of their  constitutional rights.  David, you know, in going through this pleading --  they also talked about the fact that one of the guys was taken into this  holding area, he was put into a body wrap for 30 to 40 minutes, completely  immobilizing him.  I mean, this think really ratcheted up quickly it sounds  like.  </p><p>BRUNO:  I think they have better claims about the injuries and the way that  they are treated by the police than the First Amendment.  Just getting back  to the First Amendment briefly, this is a private place, it's a private  stadium and the officer in that stadium used the word's code of conduct.   Code of conduct prevents these people from acting unruly.  So, security can  detain, they could take them out, they could ask you to leave, they are  allowed to do that.  </p><p>On the injuries, while police have to act reasonable, and I'm sure the  defense of the police officers is going to be -- well, they were resisting.   That's what they were initially charged with.  When somebody is resisting,  it's not a good scene, does not look good, I've seen it on video.  I did  not see this one particularly but that is going to be the perspective and  the defense from the police.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I get a little crazy at college football games myself, never  arrested, though -- just for the record.  OK, to this other case now at the  theme park, I want to work through this.  The family attorney suing  Universal says, \"It's not a crazy request that you would have signs in  different languages, it's actually quite basic in this day age.\"  They  said, \"You're asking for international travelers, this is a mecca for  tourism -- talking about Central Florida -- this is a very basic thing that  should be thought up for the safety of patrons.\"  David?  </p><p>BRUNO:  Yes, I disagree that they legally have to do it.  Is it a good  idea?  Yes, I think it's a good idea.  But to file a lawsuit and claim that  this Orlando theme park was negligent in not posting a Spanish sign, I  disagree.  The fact of the matter is, 72 million visitors came to the  Orlando theme parks outside of the United States and they're from all  different languages.  It's not just a Spanish.  In addition, they had an  English warning and there were also pictures that went with that.  It's not  just Spanish.  Pictures probably were enough to give this guy notice.  But  you know what, he was going on the right anyway.  </p><p>BREAM:  Marjorie, I want to give the final word here on this case.  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Well, for me, it's simply an issue of whether or not they had a  duty of care.  What is a point of having a sign if everyone who is  attending this theme park can't read it or interact with it?  The fact of  the matter is, is that there are 41 million Spanish speakers in the United  States, there's over a million who come in from outside countries, mostly  predominantly Spanish-speaking countries.  It's not a one-off that a place  like Universal Studios or a theme park like this one would have a Spanish  sign in Spanish for these kinds of warnings, especially if it's a health  risk.  Safety is a safety issue for everyone, not just for the English  speakers and for -- in addressing this issue that they really should have  it in both languages.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Marjorie and David, thank you for making your  arguments.  We appreciate your time tonight.  We put it to the jury.  Let  us know what you think @FoxNewsNight or @ShannonBream, you'll weigh in.   Thanks, guys.  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  And tonight, we end on a very somber note.  We would like to pay  tribute and say farewell to Bre Payton, she'd been a guest on our program,  she was a very close friend with our lead writer who is obviously, like so  many other people today, devastated by the news that this beautiful 26- year-old woman, brilliant and smart, suddenly passed away today in San  Diego.</p><p>Bre was a writer for The Federalist news site.  Her family, friends, and  colleagues are all shocked at her death.  We're told possibly H1N1 flu or  meningitis was involved.  A little bit early at this point, but our prayers  are with her and her friends and family.  They've set up a scholarship fund  that will go towards those supporting young, rising Christian leaders.  We  remember Bre tonight.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's been an honor and a privilege to guest host tonight. But stay tuned for Shannon Bream's show. You're going to love it. Thank you again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: This is a Fox News alert. This could have been preventable. Those words from a grieving California sheriff after an officer was gunned down in cold blood. The sheriff says, by an illegal alien, running from a drunk driving stop. The sheriff putting part of the blame on California's sanctuary policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly enjoying the big island of Hawaii amid the partial government shutdown in the battle over border security. She's not alone in escaping the beltway but could lawmakers actually get something done since the president is here and he says he's waiting on them? We'll debate.</p><p>And there's a fight over religious liberty and LGBTQ rights over controversial nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She claims she's being unfairly targeted and misquoted. A Republican senator says she's against religious liberty. Tony Perkins from the Family Research Council will weigh in.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. We begin with a tragedy sparking a national debate. In simmering battles over sanctuary cities and border security. Chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt joins us now from Los Angeles. Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. The alleged killer of Ronil Singh was apparently trying to make a run for Mexico. But officers, aided by aerial surveillance, swept into arrest him in Bakersfield, that's in central California, some 200 miles south of where the shooting happened. The arrest came just 48 hours after 33-year-old officer Ronil Singh was gunned down. He leaves behind his wife and 5- month-old son.</p><p>Today, officer Singh's brother broke down as he thanked police and sheriff deputies for finding the suspect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, OFFICER RONIL SINGH'S BROTHER: There's a lot of people out there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't know that work days and nights to make this happen. I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: The suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was in the U.S. illegally, according to the local sheriff, who angrily denounced California's so- called sanctuary laws, which the sheriff said prevented Perez Arriaga from being deported for previous DUI convictions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, SHERIFF, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: This is a criminal illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been reported to ICE. We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh.</p><p>I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because of political interference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: Officer Singh was shot dead around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning after stopping a driver on suspicion of DUI. Moments later, he radioed, \"Shots fired. I've been hit.\" He was a legal immigrant who had come to the U.S. from Fiji where he was born. He studied criminal justice once he got here, and spent 12 years in law enforcement, seven of those with the Newman Police Department.</p><p>He even took and paid for extra English lessons to help make himself better understood by his colleagues. The Newman Police Department, by the way, Shannon, has just 12 officers. A close-knit family, and the words of the police chief, and a family that will never forget Ronil Singh. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: Well, Jonathan, they got their suspects. We'll watch this case very closely. Thank you very much.</p><p>Homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen is in El Paso, Texas, where an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy was detained with his father before dying in government custody after two hospital visits. Nielsen touring multiple stations and substations operated by customs and border protection and meeting with the MTs and other first responders. Nielsen is scheduled to move onto Yuma, Arizona, tomorrow.</p><p>Well, judging from his tweets, President Trump is keeping a close eye on the border as he stays here in D.C., again this weekend. Though nearly all lawmakers are out of town, amidst this partial government shutdown. Rich Edson joins us now for the latest from the White House and the big island of Hawaii.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Too bad I'm not going live from there.</p><p>BREAM: I know.</p><p>EDSON: But we'll make do with this.</p><p>BREAM: Thanks for being with us though.</p><p>EDSON: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>So, you know, Shannon, there is no indication as partial government shutdown ends this year. Congress is mostly out of town. President Trump is still here, tweeting, quote, \"We will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and president who would approve.\"</p><p>The president is also threatening again to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, for failing to prevent their citizens from traveling illegally to the U.S. border.</p><p>The White House and Democrats are a few billion dollars apart on funding for border security. President Trump insists on money for a wall, house Democrats say the president's wall proposal is immoral, ineffective, and expensive.</p><p>Republicans are now trying to pin shutdown blame on House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi saying she's refusing to negotiate on wall funding to appear to liberal House Democrats and to assure their support in her race for speaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: She does not have the votes and if she cuts a deal with the president, of any sort before her election on January 3rd, she's at risk of losing her speakership. So we're in this for the long haul.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Republicans are also pointing to a story published in the Washington Free Beacon, claiming Pelosi is spending the shutdown vacationing at a luxury resort in Hawaii. Pelosi's office has refused to confirm or deny this story.</p><p>Our Capitol Hill team says leaders from both parties haven't been seen lately on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Republicans say Democrats have shutdown negotiations, Democrats say the shut down should have never happened. New York congressman and Democratic caucus chairman, Hakeem Jeffries tweets, quote, \"Day seven of the Trump shutdown, Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage. We refuse to pay $5 billion ransom note, in other words, take a hike.\"</p><p>Congressional leaders say they'll give members at least 24 hours notice to return to Washington to vote on any agreement to fund the government. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: Unlikely before next Thursday. But we're all be ready if it happens. Thanks, Rich.</p><p>All right. Let's bring in tonight's \"Power Panel.\" Fox news contributor, Jehmu Greene. Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto. And Fox News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell. Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to play a little bit more of what the sheriff had today -- to say today about the fact that California has a sanctuary state policies and it makes his job tougher. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIANSON: Suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because of political interference.</p><p>Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals? Gang members. It's a conversation we need to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Jehmu, your reaction?</p><p>GREENE: Well, first, and definitely foremost, you think about the family and prayers go out to the family, to the community. And it's really important I think in these times that you don't use a crime like this to demonize all undocumented immigrants.</p><p>We want this murderer to have justice that is swift and harsh. But that certainly does not mean that there is link of criminality to the rest of undocumented immigrants, as some --</p><p>BREAM: And I don't think anyone is making that suggestion.</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: No one's heard that. Where did that come from?</p><p>GREENE: Many Republicans want that to be the case, when the reality is, undocumented immigrants in this country commit considerably less crimes. Considerably less crimes than native born --</p><p>BREAM: But what we're talking about is this one situation where apparently, according to the law enforcement officials involved that this man should not have been in the country. He had previous DUI arrests. That he came here illegally.</p><p>So in the case of this family and this slain officer, Gianno, we're talking about somebody that potentially, the state's on policies allowed this or cases like this, to happen.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes. I'm incredibly disappointed with my dear colleague Jehmu's rhetoric on this issue. This is a safety issue plain and simple. It's not a partisan issue. If you look at the pure numbers, 74 percent of individuals that were brought in by ICE. In 2017, had previous felony convictions.</p><p>We talk about the sanctuary city status of places like Chicago and the state of California, which don't provide any funding for those that may be -- that ICE may want to retain. They may want to detain those individuals. They can use any personnel for that.</p><p>So, yes, this is making our country less safe and certainly, this is something that I said two days ago, on this very network, that Democrats are going to have to own any criminality that's perpetrated by individuals. They came into this country illegally because they refused to negotiate what the president of the United States on border security.</p><p>So when you have a Congress, a democratic caucus who refused to negotiate, when you have local elected officials who refused to follow the trend of -- if individuals are coming over here illegally and they are doing illegal activities that could possibly harm U.S. citizens, like we just saw, that they don't -- they don't buy into that.</p><p>So this is as very problematic. And, Jehmu, I'm just so surprised and disappointed with what you said. I'm sorry.</p><p>GREENE: Well, Shannon, there's the link right there that Gianno is trying to make between criminality and undocumented immigrants, that is just not - -</p><p>CALDWELL: I never said that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: Let me bring Art in here. Because what we're talking about is -- we're talking about -- we're talking about this case and what clearly happened here.</p><p>Now, Art, a lot of folks would say, both parties bear the blame. Both of them have been in control, at some point, the White House, the Senate, and House, and have not gotten this fixed. You know firsthand what's going on at the border.</p><p>DHS Secretary Nielsen is there today to see for herself. She's been there many times before. But Congress, it's up to them to fix this, regardless of which party is in control, they don't seem to be able to get it done.</p><p>ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: Being an illegal in this country and the security of our nation's border has nothing to do with what political party you are in. First and foremost.</p><p>Now, this is a horrific, horrific incident that happened with this officer dying, and it is 100 percent because of sanctuary cities. It is 100 percent because what you do when you have these sanctuary cities is you create a magnet for these individuals that like to break the law, which, just by the fact that you're illegally in this country, you're already a criminal, plain and simple.</p><p>People say, oh, well, he's just illegally in the country, he's not a criminal. No. If he's illegally in the country, that makes him a criminal. And it is definitely at the hands of any single individual, politician, or whoever that maybe that supports sanctuary cities.</p><p>BREAM: All right. So, Jehmu, where do we go from here? I mean, the Democrats take over the House in January, just a week from now and they've said the first thing they're going to do is refund the government, they're not going to have any funding for the wall, so that's going to go to the Senate. If it makes it through their, to the president, he said he's not going to sign anything that doesn't have funding for the wall.</p><p>I mean, where does this standoff end?</p><p>GREENE: Well, I think one place we could go from here is to revisit some of the policies that we saw in the Obama administration that were very much focused on criminals that were here undocumented, and how to put in smarter policies to target them, to track them, to find them, and to get them out of the country. When we look at how this administration is dealing with immigration and throwing out mothers who have been here for 20 years with no criminal record, and anyone who they come in contact with, that takes away the focus.</p><p>DEL CUETO: They're here illegally. That's (INAUDIBLE) all on its own.</p><p>GREENE: And so, yes, it would be -- it would be better to focus on those criminals and get them out.</p><p>BREAM: Art, I know you had something to say there. I mean, this is part of what you do and being a part of border patrol. I mean, you've seen this firsthand. What's the reality? Because listen, we know under the Obama administration, he became known as the Deporter in Chief because they were turning around so many people.</p><p>It wasn't a positive to a lot of people who supported President Obama, but we know that these policies of turning people back of denying asylum claims. I mean, they aren't new. Why are they reported and treated differently now?</p><p>DEL CUETO: Because these people care more about being angry at the president than they do about the United States and the American citizens. That's what it is. That's the way I see it.</p><p>Look, I have skin in the game. I'm out there in the field. I'm out there arresting some of these individuals, and it's easy to Monday morning quarterback it, you know, behind a desk, and you know, Far East. It's easy to Monday morning quarterback it.</p><p>President Trump has done everything possible to make sure that this country moves forward and that there's border security. And that's the reality of the entire situation.</p><p>He's a president that has reached out to the National Border Patrol council. He's on point with everything he says. And everyone needs to get on the same page because it's getting frustrating to see so many people that really don't care about the American public or about our borders, about border security.</p><p>And even with the shutdown. I have skin in the game, as I said before. We don't know when or if our next paycheck is going to come. And I've been misquoted and some of the media, or some of my words have been twisted. And I can tell you right now, the National Border Patrol Council, which I am a part of, fully support the president and fully support the shutdown, if that's what the president is asking for.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Gianno, I want to --</p><p>CALDWELL: If I can really quickly jump in there. I know that you -- really quickly.</p><p>BREAM: Sure. Go ahead.</p><p>CALDWELL: So to your same question to him, the reason why we see like nothing being done, I think Democrats have seen, especially some of our Latino brothers and sisters that are coming in, as a power base for them.</p><p>So we think about in 2006 when Senator Barack Obama said on the floor of the Senate that we needed the Secure Fence Act, which 26 Democrats voted in favor of it. Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer himself, they talked about border security in a positive way back then.</p><p>But now that we see that there is an influx and now Latinos are going to be the new minority, the new major minority, I think they're seeing this as a potential power block for them so they might as well support anything that's going to keep these voters happy.</p><p>GREENE: That is so false. That is so false and unfair.</p><p>BREAM: Gianno, the Republicans have control of the White House, the House and Senate for the last two years and their base wants to know why they didn't get something done.</p><p>CALDWELL: And that -- and that's a -- that's a very good question. I think we didn't have enough votes in the Senate to actually get something passed. Similar to that, you have to work with Democrats on it. Think about what President Trump offered the deal in terms of DACA. Democrats didn't even take it, they didn't want to take it off the table because they wanted to keep the issue alive for the midterm elections and that's exactly what they did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GREENE: Jehmu, the President keeps reneging on his deals. First it was $1.3 billion for a wall, then it's $2.5 billion for a wall. With DACA, he's reneged on so many deals. If this President is about making deals, you have to be a man of your word. He sent Vice President Pence out to front for him and then reneged on that deal. How can you get to a place of compromise and understanding if the President can't even keep his word on this issue?</p><p>BREAM: Well, he's -- listen, he's asked for a lot more than that. He and now several others in the White House say they are offering compromise deals, they've heard nothing back and don't expect they will from the Democrats until Nancy Pelosi is Speaker. So one week from today, maybe we'll have this conversation again and see if the government is reopened or what's happening. In the meantime, Jehmu, Art, and Gianno, thank you, all. Appreciate your time.</p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.</p><p>GREENE: Thanks.</p><p>DEL CUETO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BREAM: All right. The Florida Sun Sentinel publishing a bombshell report tonight on the Parkland School shooting massacre in February this year. It's headline this, unprepared and overwhelmed. The paper goes on to report the two decades after Columbine at five years after Sandy Hook, educators and police still weren't ready for Parkland. Surveillance video and the reports shows the killer Nikolas Cruz in the beginning moments of the massacre telling another student, \"you better get out of here, things are going to get messy.\"</p><p>And pulls out the AR-15 and begins shooting. The video also shows Deputy Scott Peterson, the school resource officer, the only armed law man on the campus as he reportedly -- the paper says, failed to go inside the building despite shots being fired. He ordered a school lockdown instead of ordering deputies toward the building. Later revealed in this report that officers \"may rush toward gunfire rather than shout\" according to policy there in Broward County.</p><p>Well, pushback on one of President Trump's nominees to a key federal agency by a member of his own party. We're going to tell you why. Senator Mike Lee is trying to block the nominee because of what he says is a religious freedom issue. And Tony Perkins, president of the research -- Family Research Council joins and he's going to weigh in on why this nominee is so controversial.</p><p>BREAM: Republican Senator Mike Lee is taking a stand against one of President Trump's nominees to a key Federal agency. The controversy is pretty much flown under the radar in the middle of the government shutdown but for the right and the left, there are some big issues at stake here from traditional marriage to workplace discrimination. Correspondent David Spunt is here to tell us why Senator Lee is blocking his own president -- his own party's nominee.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Shannon, it's a quite a story. As you know, the EEOC is there to protect people's civil rights in the workplace and Chai Feldblum, she's not new to the agency. She's been a commissioner since 2010, receiving support from both Republicans and Democrats. In fact, President Trump renominated her to her post just a year ago. Tonight she's defending her name as Senator Lee says, he'll really do whatever he can do to make sure that she is out of a job.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH: I object to her confirmation.</p><p>SPUNT: Utah Senator Mike Lee is making it clear he wants EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum out over concerns about her stance on religious liberty. He is prepared for a fight.</p><p>LEE: The Federal government should never, Mr. President, be used as a tool to stamp out religious liberty. That principle is so central to our nation's founding and human happiness itself. It's so important that we've got to stand behind it. Mrs. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly that.</p><p>SPUNT: Feldblum is the first and only openly gay EEOC commissioner who was quoted in a 2006 article as saying she had difficult time finding any case in which religious liberty should win over sexual liberty. Feldblum claims she was misquoted, and put out this written statement over lee's position. Senator Lee and others may feel they have kept a rabid opponent to religious liberty off the equal employment opportunity commission.</p><p>They are wrong. It is true that they have ensured that someone who cares deeply about both religious liberty and LGBT rights won't protecting those interests from the perch of the EEOC. But I have fought from the civil rights for LGBT people, religious people, and others for years. I won't be stopping now. Feldblum went on to tell Fox News in an e-mail, Senator Lee refused to meet with me when I asked to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that is why he does not know what I actually believe. In 2009, Feldblum defended religious liberty.</p><p>CHAI FELDBLUM, COMMISSIONER, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION: I also have a deep respect for and understanding of religious practice, and a deep-seated tolerance for religious difference.</p><p>SPUNT: Washington Democrat Senator Patty Murray says Feldblum must be confirmed for the sake of millions of employees across the country.</p><p>SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D), WASHINGTON: Because of the objection of a single Republican Senator, it is possible now that the EEOC will be unable to deduct some of its most critical work.</p><p>SPUNT: But Lee says he'll continue to fight to protect religious liberty, a concept he believes the EEOC should welcome.</p><p>LEE: Who is she to decide whether or not someone should be permitted to persist in their own religious beliefs? Simply because those beliefs happen to conflict with a particular political worldview?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT: And speaking of religious beliefs and an e-mail tonight, Feldblum told me that her late father was a proud rabbi. Shannon, he said -- she said he would be very upset to see exactly the way she is being portrayed right now in the media. Especially by Senator Lee with this whole situation going on.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Well, we'll keep an eye on it because I guess her commission essentially expires New Year's eve if the Senate doesn't do something and they're not here, so --</p><p>SPUNT: They're not here and there's a lot of questions about how the EEOC is going to operate for those millions of people around the country if she is not in.</p><p>BREAM: All right. David, thank you.</p><p>SPUNT: You bet.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Joining us now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council to talk about this. Tony, welcome.</p><p>TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL: Thanks, Shannon. Good to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. I want to play a little bit more of Senator Lee's critique. And then some response from the Ms. Feldblum. So here is the Senator.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious belief and LGBT liberty as \"a zero-sum game,\" where \"a gain for one side necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.\" I see no reason why that should be the case, and I think that's fundamentally incompatible with our nation's long tradition of pluralism and religious freedom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, Tony, here is her response. In part she says, it's an out of context quote that suggests I believe there is a zero-sum game between religious liberty and LGBT rights. And that LGBT rights must always prevail no matter what, that is not my position, and never has been. I care deeply about preserving religious pluralism in our country even if that means protecting religious organizations whose views I disagree with. That is the point of pluralism.</p><p>OK. What is getting lost in translation here?</p><p>PERKINS: Well, I think we've got to put it into context first and I know Chai Feldblum. She actually -- she actually spoke at the Family Research Council. I invited her one to come and speak on the panel and she made comments reflecting this coming collision between religious freedom and sexual liberty. And she then suggested that she saw that religious liberty would lose.</p><p>But she is also the architect of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which Congress has repeatedly refused to pass. Now this is -- this is literally sacrificing our vibrant first amendment on the altar of sexual libertinism. And she was unable to get that through Congress. So Barack Obama appointed her to the EEOC. Couldn't got her -- actually get her through the Senate when Harry Reid was the majority leader so he did a recess appointment.</p><p>She was subsequently after Harry Reid changed the rules where only a majority were need for presidential nominees, so she's been controversial even to her own party. She has taken positions that are 180 degrees from the Trump administration when it comes to religious freedom. And so it is -- I applaud Senator Mike Lee, spoken with him a number of times about this particular case and I applaud him for taking a stand in defense of religious liberty.</p><p>She reflects an era of the past, the Barack Obama era of hostility toward religious freedom. We don't need her on the EEOC leading that commission forward.</p><p>BREAM: But Tony, you know how this works obviously. I mean, the President has the opportunity to appoint members, the majority of members, three to two, so you have five members of the EEOC that represent his majority party but he goes to the Democrats for their nominations and their suggestions on the other two members. She is already a current sitting member of the commission.</p><p>So he's basically following up with what the Democrats want which is to keep her there. Now there is this issue as we talk about with David, that her commission expires December 31st. If the Senate doesn't take action clearly it doesn't appear that there is any way they're going to. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, could force a vote. Here is what a statement from (INAUDIBLE) vice president.</p><p>Here's what they say. Americans need a fully functional EEOC to combat discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. And Mike Lee's anti-LGBTQ views should not stand in the ways of those seeking justice under the law. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should abide by set President and immediately hold a full Senate vote on the EEOC nominees were fair-minded voices will prevail. Do you McConnell is going to do that?</p><p>PERKINS: No, I don't. I don't think he should. First off, we have to look at what the advantage she has as a returning member of the commission. I served on the Federal Commission, I know those existing members kind of influence the new members. But you have to consider the EEOC is actually lined up in Federal court against the Trump administration's own Department of Justice on the redefinition of terms such as sexual discrimination, what sex means.</p><p>Where -- this is furthering the lawlessness of the Obama administration where they unilaterally change the terms of the 1964 antidiscrimination law and civil rights law and the 1974 title VII as it pertains to employment. They have just unilaterally redefined those terms. She's doing that by bureaucratic fiat. So I think Mitch McConnell would be wrong to move forward with this. I think Mike Lee is taking the right position. I don't think the President really is pushing this.</p><p>I think you're right. It was giving the Democrats -- somebody in the White House said let's just give him what they want. Chuck Schumer wanted her. I think she needs to be off the commission.</p><p>BREAM: Well, having practiced labor and employment law in the past, I know exactly how much power the EEOC wields. And, you know, you have to ask questions about Congress, about how much power has been delegated to these Federal agencies because they don't answer to the people, they're unelected and they do have quite a bit of power. So, we'll keep an eye on it, we'll track it and we'll have Senator Lee here in the New Year to come talk to us about it as well. Tony, thank you very much. Happy New Year.</p><p>PERKINS: Happy New Year, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Up next, big tech is in the crosshairs. Congress expected her face off against social media prepping new regulations and potential oversight on content and privacy when lawmakers get back in the New Year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to put some rules of the road in place. We - - they can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Plus, a look back at the winners and losers on Capitol Hill. Congress' 2018 year in review. Chad Pergram's by the numbers when we return.</p><p>BREAM: No sign that Congress will vote anytime soon on ending a partial government shutdown. Reopening the government will likely fall to the new congress, 116th, which starts next Thursday at noon. So, what exactly did the 115th Congress actually managed to get done? Back by popular demand, Fox News Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram is here to break it down by the numbers. Chad?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Shannon, 2018 marks the end of one of those rare times Republicans control the House and Senate. So, it's a good time to take stock of what the GOP did and didn't do. Take the long the longtime GOP promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. After one failed attempt, House Republicans finely muscled through their own health care measure that then died in the United States Senate. Republicans re-engineered to the nation's tax system for the first time in three decades.</p><p>GDP topped four percent in the second quarter of 2018 for the first time in four years. Yearly, economic average growth is now on track to hit three percent for the first time in 13 years. Nevertheless, political observers blame the tax law for Republicans losing house seats in New York, New Jersey and California. Residents could no longer deduct high local taxes from their federal tax bill. Congress never addressed an infrastructure bill. And there were a failed house bills to fund the border wall and provide pathways to citizenship for some DACA recipients. The president had this message for those Republicans during a press conference in late June.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I think that's going to be a great election point for us. So, I told them two hours ago, I said, you're going to do what you want. And ultimately, we'll come to something, and perhaps, it will be after the election, maybe it will be before. But as of this moment, Democrats are not going to vote for anything because they really are resisting or obstructing. OK? Thank you very much.</p><p>PERGRAM: There were bipartisan successes. Democrats in the House and Senate finally got together on a long-awaited reform to the nation's criminal justice system. The law eliminates mandatory sentences, give inmates better training to reenter society ready to work. Lawmakers approved a major bill addressing the nation's opioid crisis. And even though part of the government is now closed, the Senate moved at its fastest clip in decades on annual spending bills. That's why this is a partial government shutdown. Congress worked out the details on five of the 12 appropriations bills months ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell often declared that the Senate is in the personnel business.</p><p>The Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees, including the knockdown, drag out fight over Brett Kavanaugh, also 32 circuit court judges and 51 district court judges. We all learned in fifth grade that Congress is designed to pass law -- quite the opposite. The founders created Congress to stop law. Consider this: lawmakers introduced 13,549 bills this Congress, 338 became law, that's 0.02 percent. 329 bills became law in the last Congress. And one bill, not destined to become a law this Congress legislation, to fund the approximate quarter of the government now held in limbo during the spending fight on a border wall. Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much. We'll see you what 2019 brings. When it comes to cybersecurity, a year in review might highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even question over bias and social media content. And as Correspondent Gillian Turner reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and online security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Members of Congress are using the partial government shutdown is an opportunity to sharpen their knives as they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year. First up, regulating big tech. Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the big three social media companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google owned YouTube.</p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS: We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans. They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: We have to put some rules of the road in place. They can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.</p><p>TURNER: But not everyone wants the same thing. Democrats want social media companies to get rid of fake news faster than they did in 2016 to avoid foreign election interference. Republicans want to hold the big three accountable for anti-conservative bias. One thing they can agree on: both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign season kicks off.</p><p>Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about: data encryption. Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake. They're taking cues from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he's been keeping this issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refuse to decrypt their data for investigators.</p><p>\"Companies are in the business of generating profit. I don't blame them for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns but it's important to understand that what's good for a technology company isn't necessarily good for America.\" Democrats are focused on protecting Americans privacy. They worry if investigators can access any encrypted data they want, it will lead to abuses in the future.</p><p>2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users. Breaches of Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone resulted in 619 million user accounts compromised -- and that's a conservative estimate. Here's hoping 2019 is more secure. Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Sounds good, Gillian Turner, thank you very much. New laws for the new year, that's where we're headed in tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\" Starting January 1st, Washington State will begin imposing fines on people who try to pass off ordinary pets as service animals. Maximum penalty, $250. Meanwhile in California, judges will be able to decide who gets custody of a pet during a divorce proceeding. Judges will take into account who takes care of the pet and feeds them.</p><p>Tough gun control measures will go on the books in Illinois this year, they include a 72-hour waiting period on all gun purchases. Another new law will allow family members or police to ask a judge to temporally remove guns from someone they think is a threat to themselves or others.</p><p>In Tennessee, women will soon be required to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion. The doctor performing the ultrasound must also let the woman know the results of the test, namely whether or not a heartbeat is detected. Doctors will also be required to put that information into the patient's medical records.</p><p>President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria still being questioned by members of both parties. But the president now has an unlikely ally -- a former high-ranking Obama official. That story is next.</p><p>BREAM: Troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria. It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory. But as Lucas Tomlinson reports, the Trump administration's new plan has support from a former senior Obama official.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Syrian forces move to the outskirts of a Kurdish-held city captured from ISIS, putting hundreds of American troops in potential danger. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces closed in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. But the Kurds say, they welcome the Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion after their U.S. allies leave. Turkey's president says, he wants the Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator): Our entire aim is to make terror organizations leave the area. If terror organizations leave, then there is no work left for us anyway. Our communications and relationships with both the United States with President Trump, whom I spoke to recently, and Russia, continues healthily.</p><p>TOMLINSON: President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month. The former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports President Trump's decision to pull out: \"Holding Northeastern Syria would not have been enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from Damascus, Tehran or Moscow. Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and stabilization teams, can reverse that. We would do well to be humbler about our abilities, especially in the face of sustained, widespread regional hostility.\"</p><p>Seven years after the start of Syria civil war, President Assad no longer feels isolated. The Gulf States are long opposed to his rule are coming back to Damascus. Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in Syria, one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same. U.S. officials tell me, there's no immediate plans to withdraw any American troops from Manbij, Syria. The complete withdrawal from a country could take months. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon, thank you. Impassioned pleas for 32 migrants who remained stranded in the Mediterranean, that leads tonight's \"WHERE IN THE WORLD.\" The German nonprofit sea-watch making an impassioned appeal to E.U. states after no European nation agreed to take in 32 migrants who've been stranded at sea for the past week. The group rescued the migrants mainly from Nigeria, Libya, and Ivory Coast, December 22nd, just 24 hours after another group rescued more than 300 migrants who were eventually taken in by Spain.</p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza pyramid, killing at least three people and wounding ten others. The countries battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.</p><p>And Cuban officials are preparing to roll out fresh austerity measures as the cash-strapped nation continues to experience the weak economic growth, following export revenue and rising debt. Cuba's economy has averaged a one percent annual growth over the past three years. Foreign trade has also fallen by about 25 percent during that same period.</p><p>All right, does buying a ticket to a sporting event give you the right to cuss out the players? Well, one fan says, security roughed him up when he used foul language and he is now taking them to court. Our legal eagles, Marjorie and David are standing by to present their cases. You are the jury. \"NIGHT COURT\" is next.</p><p>BREAM: It is time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\" Another rocket docket, we're going to try to get through two cases here. First up, a Guatemalan family suing Universal theme park in Orlando. They say the park needs more bilingual signs because the family's 38-year-old father died of a heart attack two years ago after ridding to the skull island attraction. The family says a sign in English warning that it's a ride through Kingkong's natural habitat and people with heart condition shouldn't risk it. They said, well, there wasn't a sign in Spanish.</p><p>Now, the other case, New York Giants fans suing in a San Jose, California court for the right to curse at players and flip them off. These fans say their First Amendment rights were violated last year by police officers and security there after they flipped off Giants players and told them they \"blanking suck\" -- that's a quote. These are Giants fans, they were angry that their team was losing. So, tonight's legal eagles to weigh in and remember you're the jury: Marjorie Mesidor and David Bruno, thank you both for joining us tonight.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FORMER PROSECUTOR: Hello, Shannon.</p><p>MARJORIE MESIDOR, PARTNER, PHILLIPS &amp; ASSOCIATES PLLC: Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM: OK, because we just showed a little video there. Let's start with the Giants case. They were at the game, they were yelling at their own players because they were so mad that they were losing this game. The police say that they were warned, they need to calm down, quit cursing at the players, without language, the flipping them off and it didn't work. They eventually ended up getting arrested. Let's get into a little bit of this.</p><p>A report afterwards, \"The Captain Wahid Kazem of the Santa Clara Police Department saying this, that Patrick Flynn -- one of the plaintiffs in the case -- was belligerent, intoxicated and clearly violating the stadium's code of conduct. Kazem said that Patrick Flynn and Kyle Flynn, his brother, had been warned about their behavior, they were being ejected from the stadium when Kazem said they became uncooperative and physically resistant. The officers refused to leave their seats.\" Marjorie, that's the one side of the story. How do you respond?</p><p>MESIDOR: Well, when it -- when we're talking about issues of drunkenness and disorderly conduct and the like, that, in and of itself, there's no first amendment violation they are. But if we're just talking about the speech, whether or not they had a right to flip off to the players, et cetera, essentially, the First Amendment says that all speech, all those that don't fall into a particular exception, is essentially protected.</p><p>They interfered with that speech with the arrest, and essentially you have to then look at whether or not the limitation of that speech was justified by the fact that they want a safe environment. I don't think they're going to be able to show that it fell into one of the five exceptions of speech that is excluded from freedom of speech. It's not inciting a riot, it's not criminal, it's not criminal speech, it's not obscenity in terms of the way that the law looks at obscenity. It's not pornography or any one of those things. So, I think that they have a decent case here to say that there's a First Amendment violation.</p><p>BREAM: OK, part of their complaint says this, \"The force used against the plaintiffs was excessive, unreasonable, without cause and with deliberate indifference to their health and safety.\" You saw at one point, one of the guys flips over one of the railings there. Plaintiffs suffered bodily injury, physical pain, emotional distress and deprivation of their constitutional rights. David, you know, in going through this pleading -- they also talked about the fact that one of the guys was taken into this holding area, he was put into a body wrap for 30 to 40 minutes, completely immobilizing him. I mean, this think really ratcheted up quickly it sounds like.</p><p>BRUNO: I think they have better claims about the injuries and the way that they are treated by the police than the First Amendment. Just getting back to the First Amendment briefly, this is a private place, it's a private stadium and the officer in that stadium used the word's code of conduct. Code of conduct prevents these people from acting unruly. So, security can detain, they could take them out, they could ask you to leave, they are allowed to do that.</p><p>On the injuries, while police have to act reasonable, and I'm sure the defense of the police officers is going to be -- well, they were resisting. That's what they were initially charged with. When somebody is resisting, it's not a good scene, does not look good, I've seen it on video. I did not see this one particularly but that is going to be the perspective and the defense from the police.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I get a little crazy at college football games myself, never arrested, though -- just for the record. OK, to this other case now at the theme park, I want to work through this. The family attorney suing Universal says, \"It's not a crazy request that you would have signs in different languages, it's actually quite basic in this day age.\" They said, \"You're asking for international travelers, this is a mecca for tourism -- talking about Central Florida -- this is a very basic thing that should be thought up for the safety of patrons.\" David?</p><p>BRUNO: Yes, I disagree that they legally have to do it. Is it a good idea? Yes, I think it's a good idea. But to file a lawsuit and claim that this Orlando theme park was negligent in not posting a Spanish sign, I disagree. The fact of the matter is, 72 million visitors came to the Orlando theme parks outside of the United States and they're from all different languages. It's not just a Spanish. In addition, they had an English warning and there were also pictures that went with that. It's not just Spanish. Pictures probably were enough to give this guy notice. But you know what, he was going on the right anyway.</p><p>BREAM: Marjorie, I want to give the final word here on this case.</p><p>MESIDOR: Well, for me, it's simply an issue of whether or not they had a duty of care. What is a point of having a sign if everyone who is attending this theme park can't read it or interact with it? The fact of the matter is, is that there are 41 million Spanish speakers in the United States, there's over a million who come in from outside countries, mostly predominantly Spanish-speaking countries. It's not a one-off that a place like Universal Studios or a theme park like this one would have a Spanish sign in Spanish for these kinds of warnings, especially if it's a health risk. Safety is a safety issue for everyone, not just for the English speakers and for -- in addressing this issue that they really should have it in both languages.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Marjorie and David, thank you for making your arguments. We appreciate your time tonight. We put it to the jury. Let us know what you think @FoxNewsNight or @ShannonBream, you'll weigh in. Thanks, guys.</p><p>MESIDOR: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: And tonight, we end on a very somber note. We would like to pay tribute and say farewell to Bre Payton, she'd been a guest on our program, she was a very close friend with our lead writer who is obviously, like so many other people today, devastated by the news that this beautiful 26- year-old woman, brilliant and smart, suddenly passed away today in San Diego.</p><p>Bre was a writer for The Federalist news site. Her family, friends, and colleagues are all shocked at her death. We're told possibly H1N1 flu or meningitis was involved. A little bit early at this point, but our prayers are with her and her friends and family. They've set up a scholarship fund that will go towards those supporting young, rising Christian leaders. We remember Bre tonight.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's been an honor and a privilege to guest host  tonight.  But stay tuned for Shannon Bream's show.  You're going to love  it.  Thank you again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  This is a Fox News alert.  This could have  been preventable.  Those words from a grieving California sheriff after an  officer was gunned down in cold blood.  The sheriff says, by an illegal  alien, running from a drunk driving stop.  The sheriff putting part of the  blame on California's sanctuary policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly enjoying the big island of Hawaii  amid the partial government shutdown in the battle over border security.   She's not alone in escaping the beltway but could lawmakers actually get  something done since the president is here and he says he's waiting on  them?  We'll debate.</p><p> And there's a fight over religious liberty and LGBTQ rights over  controversial nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  She  claims she's being unfairly targeted and misquoted.  A Republican senator  says she's against religious liberty.  Tony Perkins from the Family  Research Council will weigh in.</p><p> Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.   We begin with a tragedy sparking a national debate.  In simmering battles  over sanctuary cities and border security.  Chief correspondent Jonathan  Hunt joins us now from Los Angeles.  Hey, Jonathan.</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  The  alleged killer of Ronil Singh was apparently trying to make a run for  Mexico.  But officers, aided by aerial surveillance, swept into arrest him  in Bakersfield, that's in central California, some 200 miles south of where  the shooting happened.  The arrest came just 48 hours after 33-year-old  officer Ronil Singh was gunned down.  He leaves behind his wife and 5- month-old son.  </p><p> Today, officer Singh's brother broke down as he thanked police and sheriff  deputies for finding the suspect.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGGIE SINGH, OFFICER RONIL SINGH'S BROTHER:  There's a lot of people out  there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't  know that work days and nights to make this happen.  I'd like to thank you  from the bottom of my heart.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT:  The suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was in the U.S. illegally,  according to the local sheriff, who angrily denounced California's so- called sanctuary laws, which the sheriff said prevented Perez Arriaga from  being deported for previous DUI convictions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM CHRISTIANSON, SHERIFF, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  This is a  criminal illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been  reported to ICE.  We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited  because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh.</p><p> I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT:  Officer Singh was shot dead around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning after  stopping a driver on suspicion of DUI.  Moments later, he radioed, \"Shots  fired.  I've been hit.\"  He was a legal immigrant who had come to the U.S.  from Fiji where he was born.  He studied criminal justice once he got here,  and spent 12 years in law enforcement, seven of those with the Newman  Police Department.</p><p> He even took and paid for extra English lessons to help make himself better  understood by his colleagues.  The Newman Police Department, by the way,  Shannon, has just 12 officers.  A close-knit family, and the words of the  police chief, and a family that will never forget Ronil Singh.

Though nearly all  lawmakers are out of town, amidst this partial government shutdown.  Rich  Edson joins us now for the latest from the White House and the big island  of Hawaii.</p><p> RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  Too bad I'm  not going live from there.</p><p> BREAM:  I know.</p><p> EDSON:  But we'll make do with this.</p><p> BREAM:  Thanks for being with us though.</p><p> EDSON:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p> So, you know, Shannon, there is no indication as partial government  shutdown ends this year.  Congress is mostly out of town.  President Trump  is still here, tweeting, quote, \"We will be forced to close the southern  border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to  finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our  country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve.\"</p><p> The president is also threatening again to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala,  and El Salvador, for failing to prevent their citizens from traveling  illegally to the U.S. border.</p><p> The White House and Democrats are a few billion dollars apart on funding  for border security.

Shannon?</p><p> BREAM:  Unlikely before next Thursday.  But we're all be ready if it  happens.  Thanks, Rich.</p><p> All right.  Let's bring in tonight's \"Power Panel.\"  Fox news contributor,  Jehmu Greene.  Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto.  And  Fox News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p> JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good evening.</p><p> BREAM:  OK.  I want to play a little bit more of what the sheriff had today  -- to say today about the fact that California has a sanctuary state  policies and it makes his job tougher.  Here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTIANSON:  Suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p> Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals?  Gang members.  It's a  conversation we need to have.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM:  Jehmu, your reaction?</p><p> GREENE:  Well, first, and definitely foremost, you think about the family  and prayers go out to the family, to the community.  And it's really  important I think in these times that you don't use a crime like this to  demonize all undocumented immigrants.</p><p> We want this murderer to have justice that is swift and harsh.  But that  certainly does not mean that there is link of criminality to the rest of  undocumented immigrants, as some -- </p><p> BREAM:  And I don't think anyone is making that suggestion.</p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No one's heard that.  Where  did that come from?</p><p> GREENE:  Many Republicans want that to be the case, when the reality is,  undocumented immigrants in this country commit considerably less crimes.   Considerably less crimes than native born -- </p><p> BREAM:  But what we're talking about is this one situation where  apparently, according to the law enforcement officials involved that this  man should not have been in the country.  He had previous DUI arrests.   That he came here illegally.</p><p> So in the case of this family and this slain officer, Gianno, we're talking  about somebody that potentially, the state's on policies allowed this or  cases like this, to happen.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Yes.  I'm incredibly disappointed with my dear colleague Jehmu's  rhetoric on this issue.  This is a safety issue plain and simple.  It's not  a partisan issue.  If you look at the pure numbers, 74 percent of  individuals that were brought in by ICE.  In 2017, had previous felony  convictions.</p><p> We talk about the sanctuary city status of places like Chicago and the  state of California, which don't provide any funding for those that may be  -- that ICE may want to retain.  They may want to detain those individuals.   They can use any personnel for that.</p><p> So, yes, this is making our country less safe and certainly, this is  something that I said two days ago, on this very network, that Democrats  are going to have to own any criminality that's perpetrated by individuals.   They came into this country illegally because they refused to negotiate  what the president of the United States on border security.</p><p> So when you have a Congress, a democratic caucus who refused to negotiate,  when you have local elected officials who refused to follow the trend of --  if individuals are coming over here illegally and they are doing illegal  activities that could possibly harm U.S. citizens, like we just saw, that  they don't -- they don't buy into that.</p><p> So this is as very problematic.  And, Jehmu, I'm just so surprised and  disappointed with what you said.  I'm sorry.</p><p> GREENE:  Well, Shannon, there's the link right there that Gianno is trying  to make between criminality and undocumented immigrants, that is just not - - </p><p> CALDWELL:  I never said that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BREAM:  Let me bring Art in here.  Because what we're talking about is --  we're talking about -- we're talking about this case and what clearly  happened here.</p><p> Now, Art, a lot of folks would say, both parties bear the blame.  Both of  them have been in control, at some point, the White House, the Senate, and  House, and have not gotten this fixed.  You know firsthand what's going on  at the border.</p><p> DHS Secretary Nielsen is there today to see for herself.  She's been there  many times before.  But Congress, it's up to them to fix this, regardless  of which party is in control, they don't seem to be able to get it done. </p><p> ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Being an  illegal in this country and the security of our nation's border has nothing  to do with what political party you are in.  First and foremost.</p><p> Now, this is a horrific, horrific incident that happened with this officer  dying, and it is 100 percent because of sanctuary cities.  It is 100  percent because what you do when you have these sanctuary cities is you  create a magnet for these individuals that like to break the law, which,  just by the fact that you're illegally in this country, you're already a  criminal, plain and simple.</p><p> People say, oh, well, he's just illegally in the country, he's not a  criminal.  No.  If he's illegally in the country, that makes him a  criminal.  And it is definitely at the hands of any single individual,  politician, or whoever that maybe that supports sanctuary cities.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  So, Jehmu, where do we go from here?  I mean, the  Democrats take over the House in January, just a week from now and they've  said the first thing they're going to do is refund the government, they're  not going to have any funding for the wall, so that's going to go to the  Senate.  If it makes it through their, to the president, he said he's not  going to sign anything that doesn't have funding for the wall.</p><p> I mean, where does this standoff end?</p><p> GREENE:  Well, I think one place we could go from here is to revisit some  of the policies that we saw in the Obama administration that were very much  focused on criminals that were here undocumented, and how to put in smarter  policies to target them, to track them, to find them, and to get them out  of the country.  When we look at how this administration is dealing with  immigration and throwing out mothers who have been here for 20 years with  no criminal record, and anyone who they come in contact with, that takes  away the focus.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  They're here illegally.  That's (INAUDIBLE) all on its own.</p><p> GREENE:  And so, yes, it would be -- it would be better to focus on those  criminals and get them out.</p><p> BREAM:  Art, I know you had something to say there.  I mean, this is part  of what you do and being a part of border patrol.  I mean, you've seen this  firsthand.  What's the reality?  Because listen, we know under the Obama  administration, he became known as the Deporter in Chief because they were  turning around so many people.</p><p> It wasn't a positive to a lot of people who supported President Obama, but  we know that these policies of turning people back of denying asylum  claims.  I mean, they aren't new.  Why are they reported and treated  differently now?</p><p> DEL CUETO:  Because these people care more about being angry at the  president than they do about the United States and the American citizens.   That's what it is.  That's the way I see it.</p><p> Look, I have skin in the game.  I'm out there in the field.  I'm out there  arresting some of these individuals, and it's easy to Monday morning  quarterback it, you know, behind a desk, and you know, Far East.  It's easy  to Monday morning quarterback it.</p><p> President Trump has done everything possible to make sure that this country  moves forward and that there's border security.  And that's the reality of  the entire situation.</p><p> He's a president that has reached out to the National Border Patrol  council.  He's on point with everything he says.  And everyone needs to get  on the same page because it's getting frustrating to see so many people  that really don't care about the American public or about our borders,  about border security.</p><p> And even with the shutdown.  I have skin in the game, as I said before.  We  don't know when or if our next paycheck is going to come.  And I've been  misquoted and some of the media, or some of my words have been twisted.   And I can tell you right now, the National Border Patrol Council, which I  am a part of, fully support the president and fully support the shutdown,  if that's what the president is asking for.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Gianno, I want to -- </p><p> CALDWELL:  If I can really quickly jump in there.  I know that you --  really quickly.</p><p> BREAM:  Sure.  Go ahead.</p><p> CALDWELL:  So to your same question to him, the reason why we see like  nothing being done, I think Democrats have seen, especially some of our  Latino brothers and sisters that are coming in, as a power base for them.</p><p> So we think about in 2006 when Senator Barack Obama said on the floor of  the Senate that we needed the Secure Fence Act, which 26 Democrats voted in  favor of it.  Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer himself, they talked about  border security in a positive way back then.</p><p> But now that we see that there is an influx and now Latinos are going to be  the new minority, the new major minority, I think they're seeing this as a  potential power block for them so they might as well support anything  that's going to keep these voters happy.</p><p> GREENE:  That is so false.  That is so false and unfair.</p><p> BREAM:  Gianno, the Republicans have control of the White House, the House  and Senate for the last two years and their base wants to know why they  didn't get something done.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And that -- and that's a -- that's a very good question.  I  think we didn't have enough votes in the Senate to actually get something  passed.  Similar to that, you have to work with Democrats on it.  Think  about what President Trump offered the deal in terms of DACA.  Democrats  didn't even take it, they didn't want to take it off the table because they  wanted to keep the issue alive for the midterm elections and that's exactly  what they did.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GREENE:  Jehmu, the President keeps reneging on his deals.  First it was  $1.3 billion for a wall, then it's $2.5 billion for a wall.  With DACA,  he's reneged on so many deals.  If this President is about making deals,  you have to be a man of your word.  He sent Vice President Pence out to  front for him and then reneged on that deal.  How can you get to a place of  compromise and understanding if the President can't even keep his word on  this issue? </p><p> BREAM:  Well, he's -- listen, he's asked for a lot more than that.  He and  now several others in the White House say they are offering compromise  deals, they've heard nothing back and don't expect they will from the  Democrats until Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.  So one week from today, maybe  we'll have this conversation again and see if the government is reopened or  what's happening.  In the meantime, Jehmu, Art, and Gianno, thank you, all.   Appreciate your time.  </p><p> CALDWELL: Thank you.  </p><p> GREENE:  Thanks.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  The Florida Sun Sentinel publishing a bombshell report  tonight on the Parkland School shooting massacre in February this year.   It's headline this, unprepared and overwhelmed.  The paper goes on to  report the two decades after Columbine at five years after Sandy Hook,  educators and police still weren't ready for Parkland.  Surveillance video  and the reports shows the killer Nikolas Cruz in the beginning moments of  the massacre telling another student, \"you better get out of here, things  are going to get messy.\"</p><p> And pulls out the AR-15 and begins shooting.  The video also shows Deputy  Scott Peterson, the school resource officer, the only armed law man on the  campus as he reportedly -- the paper says, failed to go inside the building  despite shots being fired.  He ordered a school lockdown instead of  ordering deputies toward the building.  Later revealed in this report that  officers \"may rush toward gunfire rather than shout\" according to policy  there in Broward County.</p><p> Well, pushback on one of President Trump's nominees to a key federal agency  by a member of his own party.  We're going to tell you why.  Senator Mike  Lee is trying to block the nominee because of what he says is a religious  freedom issue.  And Tony Perkins, president of the research -- Family  Research Council joins and he's going to weigh in on why this nominee is so  controversial. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  Republican Senator Mike Lee is taking a stand against one of  President Trump's nominees to a key Federal agency.  The controversy is  pretty much flown under the radar in the middle of the government shutdown  but for the right and the left, there are some big issues at stake here  from traditional marriage to workplace discrimination.  Correspondent David  Spunt is here to tell us why Senator Lee is blocking his own president --  his own party's nominee.  </p><p> DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Shannon, it's a quite a story.   As you know, the EEOC is there to protect people's civil rights in the  workplace and Chai Feldblum, she's not new to the agency.  She's been a  commissioner since 2010, receiving support from both Republicans and  Democrats.  In fact, President Trump renominated her to her post just a  year ago.  Tonight she's defending her name as Senator Lee says, he'll  really do whatever he can do to make sure that she is out of a job.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I object to her confirmation.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Utah Senator Mike Lee is making it clear he wants EEOC Commissioner  Chai Feldblum out over concerns about her stance on religious liberty.  He  is prepared for a fight.  </p><p> LEE:  The Federal government should never, Mr. President, be used as a tool  to stamp out religious liberty.  That principle is so central to our  nation's founding and human happiness itself.  It's so important that we've  got to stand behind it.  Mrs. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly  that.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Feldblum is the first and only openly gay EEOC commissioner who was  quoted in a 2006 article as saying she had difficult time finding any case  in which religious liberty should win over sexual liberty.  Feldblum claims  she was misquoted, and put out this written statement over lee's position.   Senator Lee and others may feel they have kept a rabid opponent to  religious liberty off the equal employment opportunity commission.</p><p> They are wrong.  It is true that they have ensured that someone who cares  deeply about both religious liberty and LGBT rights won't protecting those  interests from the perch of the EEOC.  But I have fought from the civil  rights for LGBT people, religious people, and others for years.  I won't be  stopping now.  Feldblum went on to tell Fox News in an e-mail, Senator Lee  refused to meet with me when I asked to do so.</p><p> Perhaps that is why he does not know what I actually believe.  In 2009,  Feldblum defended religious liberty.  </p><p> CHAI FELDBLUM, COMMISSIONER, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION:  I  also have a deep respect for and understanding of religious practice, and a  deep-seated tolerance for religious difference.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Washington Democrat Senator Patty Murray says Feldblum must be  confirmed for the sake of millions of employees across the country.  </p><p> SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D), WASHINGTON:  Because of the objection of a single  Republican Senator, it is possible now that the EEOC will be unable to  deduct some of its most critical work.  </p><p> SPUNT:  But Lee says he'll continue to fight to protect religious liberty,  a concept he believes the EEOC should welcome.  </p><p> LEE:  Who is she to decide whether or not someone should be permitted to  persist in their own religious beliefs?  Simply because those beliefs  happen to conflict with a particular political worldview?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPUNT:  And speaking of religious beliefs and an e-mail tonight, Feldblum  told me that her late father was a proud rabbi.  Shannon, he said -- she  said he would be very upset to see exactly the way she is being portrayed  right now in the media.  Especially by Senator Lee with this whole  situation going on.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Well, we'll keep an eye on it because I guess her  commission essentially expires New Year's eve if the Senate doesn't do  something and they're not here, so --</p><p> SPUNT:  They're not here and there's a lot of questions about how the EEOC  is going to operate for those millions of people around the country if she  is not in.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  David, thank you.</p><p> SPUNT:  You bet.</p><p> BREAM:  OK.  Joining us now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research  Council to talk about this.  Tony, welcome.  </p><p> TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL:  Thanks, Shannon.  Good  to be with you.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  I want to play a little bit more of Senator Lee's  critique.  And then some response from the Ms. Feldblum.  So here is the  Senator.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LEE:  Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious  belief and LGBT liberty as \"a zero-sum game,\" where \"a gain for one side  necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.\"  I see no  reason why that should be the case, and I think that's fundamentally  incompatible with our nation's long tradition of pluralism and religious  freedom.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BREAM:  OK.  So, Tony, here is her response.  In part she says, it's an out  of context quote that suggests I believe there is a zero-sum game between  religious liberty and LGBT rights.  And that LGBT rights must always  prevail no matter what, that is not my position, and never has been.  I  care deeply about preserving religious pluralism in our country even if  that means protecting religious organizations whose views I disagree with.   That is the point of pluralism.</p><p> OK.  What is getting lost in translation here?  </p><p> PERKINS:  Well, I think we've got to put it into context first and I know  Chai Feldblum.  She actually -- she actually spoke at the Family Research  Council.  I invited her one to come and speak on the panel and she made  comments reflecting this coming collision between religious freedom and  sexual liberty.  And she then suggested that she saw that religious liberty  would lose.</p><p> But she is also the architect of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,  which Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.  Now this is -- this is  literally sacrificing our vibrant first amendment on the altar of sexual  libertinism.  And she was unable to get that through Congress.  So Barack  Obama appointed her to the EEOC.  Couldn't got her -- actually get her  through the Senate when Harry Reid was the majority leader so he did a  recess appointment.</p><p> She was subsequently after Harry Reid changed the rules where only a  majority were need for presidential nominees, so she's been controversial  even to her own party.  She has taken positions that are 180 degrees from  the Trump administration when it comes to religious freedom.  And so it is  -- I applaud Senator Mike Lee, spoken with him a number of times about this  particular case and I applaud him for taking a stand in defense of  religious liberty.</p><p> She reflects an era of the past, the Barack Obama era of hostility toward  religious freedom.  We don't need her on the EEOC leading that commission  forward.  </p><p> BREAM:  But Tony, you know how this works obviously.  I mean, the President  has the opportunity to appoint members, the majority of members, three to  two, so you have five members of the EEOC that represent his majority party  but he goes to the Democrats for their nominations and their suggestions on  the other two members.  She is already a current sitting member of the  commission.</p><p> So he's basically following up with what the Democrats want which is to  keep her there.  Now there is this issue as we talk about with David, that  her commission expires December 31st.  If the Senate doesn't take action  clearly it doesn't appear that there is any way they're going to.  Mitch  McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, could force a vote.  Here is what a  statement from (INAUDIBLE) vice president.</p><p> Here's what they say.  Americans need a fully functional EEOC to combat  discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.  And Mike Lee's  anti-LGBTQ views should not stand in the ways of those seeking justice  under the law.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should abide by set  President and immediately hold a full Senate vote on the EEOC nominees were  fair-minded voices will prevail.  Do you McConnell is going to do that?  </p><p> PERKINS:  No, I don't.  I don't think he should.  First off, we have to  look at what the advantage she has as a returning member of the commission.   I served on the Federal Commission, I know those existing members kind of  influence the new members.  But you have to consider the EEOC is actually  lined up in Federal court against the Trump administration's own Department  of Justice on the redefinition of terms such as sexual discrimination, what  sex means.</p><p> Where -- this is furthering the lawlessness of the Obama administration  where they unilaterally change the terms of the 1964 antidiscrimination law  and civil rights law and the 1974 title VII as it pertains to employment.   They have just unilaterally redefined those terms.  She's doing that by  bureaucratic fiat.  So I think Mitch McConnell would be wrong to move  forward with this.  I think Mike Lee is taking the right position.  I don't  think the President really is pushing this.</p><p> I think you're right.  It was giving the Democrats -- somebody in the White  House said let's just give him what they want.  Chuck Schumer wanted her.   I think she needs to be off the commission.  </p><p> BREAM:  Well, having practiced labor and employment law in the past, I know  exactly how much power the EEOC wields.  And, you know, you have to ask  questions about Congress, about how much power has been delegated to these  Federal agencies because they don't answer to the people, they're unelected  and they do have quite a bit of power.  So, we'll keep an eye on it, we'll  track it and we'll have Senator Lee here in the New Year to come talk to us  about it as well.  Tony, thank you very much.  Happy New Year.  </p><p> PERKINS:  Happy New Year, Shannon.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Up next, big tech is in the crosshairs.  Congress  expected her face off against social media prepping new regulations and  potential oversight on content and privacy when lawmakers get back in the  New Year.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have to put some rules of the road in place.  We - - they can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BREAM:  Plus, a look back at the winners and losers on Capitol Hill.   Congress' 2018 year in review.  Chad Pergram's by the numbers when we  return.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  No sign that Congress will vote anytime soon on ending a partial  government shutdown.  Reopening the government will likely fall to the new  congress, 116th, which starts next Thursday at noon.  So, what exactly did  the 115th Congress actually managed to get done?  Back by popular demand,  Fox News Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram is here to break it down  by the numbers.  Chad?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Shannon, 2018 marks  the end of one of those rare times Republicans control the House and  Senate.  So, it's a good time to take stock of what the GOP did and didn't  do.  Take the long the longtime GOP promise to repeal and replace  Obamacare.  After one failed attempt, House Republicans finely muscled  through their own health care measure that then died in the United States  Senate.  Republicans re-engineered to the nation's tax system for the first  time in three decades.  </p><p> GDP topped four percent in the second quarter of 2018 for the first time in  four years.  Yearly, economic average growth is now on track to hit three  percent for the first time in 13 years.  Nevertheless, political observers  blame the tax law for Republicans losing house seats in New York, New  Jersey and California.  Residents could no longer deduct high local taxes  from their federal tax bill.  Congress never addressed an infrastructure  bill.  And there were a failed house bills to fund the border wall and  provide pathways to citizenship for some DACA recipients.  The president  had this message for those Republicans during a press conference in late  June.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think that's going to  be a great election point for us.  So, I told them two hours ago, I said,  you're going to do what you want.  And ultimately, we'll come to something,  and perhaps, it will be after the election, maybe it will be before.  But  as of this moment, Democrats are not going to vote for anything because  they really are resisting or obstructing.  OK?  Thank you very much.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  There were bipartisan successes.  Democrats in the House and  Senate finally got together on a long-awaited reform to the nation's  criminal justice system.  The law eliminates mandatory sentences, give  inmates better training to reenter society ready to work.  Lawmakers  approved a major bill addressing the nation's opioid crisis.  And even  though part of the government is now closed, the Senate moved at its  fastest clip in decades on annual spending bills.  That's why this is a  partial government shutdown.  Congress worked out the details on five of  the 12 appropriations bills months ago.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell often declared that the Senate is in the personnel business.  </p><p> The Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees, including the knockdown,  drag out fight over Brett Kavanaugh, also 32 circuit court judges and 51  district court judges.  We all learned in fifth grade that Congress is  designed to pass law -- quite the opposite.  The founders created Congress  to stop law.  Consider this: lawmakers introduced 13,549 bills this  Congress, 338 became law, that's 0.02 percent.  329 bills became law in the  last Congress.  And one bill, not destined to become a law this Congress  legislation, to fund the approximate quarter of the government now held in  limbo during the spending fight on a border wall.  Shannon? </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BREAM:  All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much.  We'll see you what  2019 brings.  When it comes to cybersecurity, a year in review might  highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even question  over bias and social media content.  And as Correspondent Gillian Turner  reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and  online security.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown is an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.  First up,  regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the  big three social media companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google owned  YouTube.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the road  in place.  They can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news faster than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on:  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.  </p><p> Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about: data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They're taking  cues from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refuse to  decrypt their data for investigators.  </p><p> \"Companies are in the business of generating profit.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns but it's  important to understand that what's good for a technology company isn't  necessarily good for America.\"  Democrats are focused on protecting  Americans privacy.  They worry if investigators can access any encrypted  data they want, it will lead to abuses in the future.  </p><p> 2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.  Breaches  of Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Here's hoping  2019 is more secure.  Shannon?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREAM:  Sounds good, Gillian Turner, thank you very much.  New laws for the  new year, that's where we're headed in tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"   Starting January 1st, Washington State will begin imposing fines on people  who try to pass off ordinary pets as service animals.  Maximum penalty,  $250.  Meanwhile in California, judges will be able to decide who gets  custody of a pet during a divorce proceeding.  Judges will take into  account who takes care of the pet and feeds them.  </p><p> Tough gun control measures will go on the books in Illinois this year, they  include a 72-hour waiting period on all gun purchases.  Another new law  will allow family members or police to ask a judge to temporally remove  guns from someone they think is a threat to themselves or others.  </p><p> In Tennessee, women will soon be required to get an ultrasound before  getting an abortion.  The doctor performing the ultrasound must also let  the woman know the results of the test, namely whether or not a heartbeat  is detected.  Doctors will also be required to put that information into  the patient's medical records.  </p><p> President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria still being questioned by  members of both parties.  But the president now has an unlikely ally -- a  former high-ranking Obama official.  That story is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  Troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.   It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.   But as Lucas Tomlinson reports, the Trump administration's new plan has  support from a former senior Obama official.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Syrian forces move to the  outskirts of a Kurdish-held city captured from ISIS, putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's  forces closed in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal  of U.S. forces from the country.  But the Kurds say, they welcome the  Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion  after their U.S. allies leave.  Turkey's president says, he wants the  Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.  </p><p> RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave, then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States with President  Trump, whom I spoke to recently, and Russia, continues healthily.  </p><p> TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out: \"Holding Northeastern Syria would  not have been enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams, can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler  about our abilities, especially in the face of sustained, widespread  regional hostility.\" </p><p> Seven years after the start of Syria civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  The Gulf States are long opposed to his rule are coming  back to Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in  Syria, one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.  U.S. officials  tell me, there's no immediate plans to withdraw any American troops from  Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from a country could take months.   Shannon?  </p><p> BREAM:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon, thank you.  Impassioned pleas for  32 migrants who remained stranded in the Mediterranean, that leads  tonight's \"WHERE IN THE WORLD.\"  The German nonprofit sea-watch making an  impassioned appeal to E.U. states after no European nation agreed to take  in 32 migrants who've been stranded at sea for the past week.  The group  rescued the migrants mainly from Nigeria, Libya, and Ivory Coast, December  22nd, just 24 hours after another group rescued more than 300 migrants who  were eventually taken in by Spain.  </p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  pyramid, killing at least three people and wounding ten others.  The  countries battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack  to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.  </p><p> And Cuban officials are preparing to roll out fresh austerity measures as  the cash-strapped nation continues to experience the weak economic growth,  following export revenue and rising debt.  Cuba's economy has averaged a  one percent annual growth over the past three years.  Foreign trade has  also fallen by about 25 percent during that same period.  </p><p> All right, does buying a ticket to a sporting event give you the right to  cuss out the players?  Well, one fan says, security roughed him up when he  used foul language and he is now taking them to court.  Our legal eagles,  Marjorie and David are standing by to present their cases.  You are the  jury.  \"NIGHT COURT\" is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  It is time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\"  Another rocket docket, we're  going to try to get through two cases here.  First up, a Guatemalan family  suing Universal theme park in Orlando.  They say the park needs more  bilingual signs because the family's 38-year-old father died of a heart  attack two years ago after ridding to the skull island attraction.  The  family says a sign in English warning that it's a ride through Kingkong's  natural habitat and people with heart condition shouldn't risk it.  They  said, well, there wasn't a sign in Spanish.  </p><p> Now, the other case, New York Giants fans suing in a San Jose, California  court for the right to curse at players and flip them off.  These fans say  their First Amendment rights were violated last year by police officers and  security there after they flipped off Giants players and told them they  \"blanking suck\" -- that's a quote.  These are Giants fans, they were angry  that their team was losing.  So, tonight's legal eagles to weigh in and  remember you're the jury: Marjorie Mesidor and David Bruno, thank you both  for joining us tonight.  </p><p> DAVID BRUNO, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Hello, Shannon.</p><p> MARJORIE MESIDOR, PARTNER, PHILLIPS &amp; ASSOCIATES PLLC:  Thank you for  having us.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK, because we just showed a little video there.  Let's start with  the Giants case.  They were at the game, they were yelling at their own  players because they were so mad that they were losing this game.  The  police say that they were warned, they need to calm down, quit cursing at  the players, without language, the flipping them off and it didn't work.   They eventually ended up getting arrested.  Let's get into a little bit of  this.  </p><p> A report afterwards, \"The Captain Wahid Kazem of the Santa Clara Police  Department saying this, that Patrick Flynn -- one of the plaintiffs in the  case -- was belligerent, intoxicated and clearly violating the stadium's  code of conduct.  Kazem said that Patrick Flynn and Kyle Flynn, his  brother, had been warned about their behavior, they were being ejected from  the stadium when Kazem said they became uncooperative and physically  resistant.  The officers refused to leave their seats.\"  Marjorie, that's  the one side of the story.  How do you respond?  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Well, when it -- when we're talking about issues of drunkenness  and disorderly conduct and the like, that, in and of itself, there's no  first amendment violation they are.  But if we're just talking about the  speech, whether or not they had a right to flip off to the players, et  cetera, essentially, the First Amendment says that all speech, all those  that don't fall into a particular exception, is essentially protected.  </p><p> They interfered with that speech with the arrest, and essentially you have  to then look at whether or not the limitation of that speech was justified  by the fact that they want a safe environment.  I don't think they're going  to be able to show that it fell into one of the five exceptions of speech  that is excluded from freedom of speech.  It's not inciting a riot, it's  not criminal, it's not criminal speech, it's not obscenity in terms of the  way that the law looks at obscenity.  It's not pornography or any one of  those things.  So, I think that they have a decent case here to say that  there's a First Amendment violation.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK, part of their complaint says this, \"The force used against the  plaintiffs was excessive, unreasonable, without cause and with deliberate  indifference to their health and safety.\"  You saw at one point, one of the  guys flips over one of the railings there.  Plaintiffs suffered bodily  injury, physical pain, emotional distress and deprivation of their  constitutional rights.  David, you know, in going through this pleading --  they also talked about the fact that one of the guys was taken into this  holding area, he was put into a body wrap for 30 to 40 minutes, completely  immobilizing him.  I mean, this think really ratcheted up quickly it sounds  like.  </p><p> BRUNO:  I think they have better claims about the injuries and the way that  they are treated by the police than the First Amendment.  Just getting back  to the First Amendment briefly, this is a private place, it's a private  stadium and the officer in that stadium used the word's code of conduct.   Code of conduct prevents these people from acting unruly.  So, security can  detain, they could take them out, they could ask you to leave, they are  allowed to do that.  </p><p> On the injuries, while police have to act reasonable, and I'm sure the  defense of the police officers is going to be -- well, they were resisting.   That's what they were initially charged with.  When somebody is resisting,  it's not a good scene, does not look good, I've seen it on video.  I did  not see this one particularly but that is going to be the perspective and  the defense from the police.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK.  I get a little crazy at college football games myself, never  arrested, though -- just for the record.  OK, to this other case now at the  theme park, I want to work through this.  The family attorney suing  Universal says, \"It's not a crazy request that you would have signs in  different languages, it's actually quite basic in this day age.\"  They  said, \"You're asking for international travelers, this is a mecca for  tourism -- talking about Central Florida -- this is a very basic thing that  should be thought up for the safety of patrons.\"  David?  </p><p> BRUNO:  Yes, I disagree that they legally have to do it.  Is it a good  idea?  Yes, I think it's a good idea.  But to file a lawsuit and claim that  this Orlando theme park was negligent in not posting a Spanish sign, I  disagree.  The fact of the matter is, 72 million visitors came to the  Orlando theme parks outside of the United States and they're from all  different languages.  It's not just a Spanish.  In addition, they had an  English warning and there were also pictures that went with that.  It's not  just Spanish.  Pictures probably were enough to give this guy notice.  But  you know what, he was going on the right anyway.  </p><p> BREAM:  Marjorie, I want to give the final word here on this case.  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Well, for me, it's simply an issue of whether or not they had a  duty of care.  What is a point of having a sign if everyone who is  attending this theme park can't read it or interact with it?  The fact of  the matter is, is that there are 41 million Spanish speakers in the United  States, there's over a million who come in from outside countries, mostly  predominantly Spanish-speaking countries.  It's not a one-off that a place  like Universal Studios or a theme park like this one would have a Spanish  sign in Spanish for these kinds of warnings, especially if it's a health  risk.  Safety is a safety issue for everyone, not just for the English  speakers and for -- in addressing this issue that they really should have  it in both languages.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Marjorie and David, thank you for making your  arguments.  We appreciate your time tonight.  We put it to the jury.  Let  us know what you think @FoxNewsNight or @ShannonBream, you'll weigh in.   Thanks, guys.  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Thank you.</p><p> BREAM:  And tonight, we end on a very somber note.  We would like to pay  tribute and say farewell to Bre Payton, she'd been a guest on our program,  she was a very close friend with our lead writer who is obviously, like so  many other people today, devastated by the news that this beautiful 26- year-old woman, brilliant and smart, suddenly passed away today in San  Diego.</p><p> Bre was a writer for The Federalist news site.  Her family, friends, and  colleagues are all shocked at her death.  We're told possibly H1N1 flu or  meningitis was involved.  A little bit early at this point, but our prayers  are with her and her friends and family.  They've set up a scholarship fund  that will go towards those supporting young, rising Christian leaders.  We  remember Bre tonight.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's been an honor and a privilege to guest host  tonight.  But stay tuned for Shannon Bream's show.  You're going to love  it.  Thank you again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  This is a Fox News alert.  This could have  been preventable.  Those words from a grieving California sheriff after an  officer was gunned down in cold blood.  The sheriff says, by an illegal  alien, running from a drunk driving stop.  The sheriff putting part of the  blame on California's sanctuary policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly enjoying the big island of Hawaii  amid the partial government shutdown in the battle over border security.   She's not alone in escaping the beltway but could lawmakers actually get  something done since the president is here and he says he's waiting on  them?  We'll debate.</p><p>And there's a fight over religious liberty and LGBTQ rights over  controversial nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  She  claims she's being unfairly targeted and misquoted.  A Republican senator  says she's against religious liberty.  Tony Perkins from the Family  Research Council will weigh in.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.   We begin with a tragedy sparking a national debate.  In simmering battles  over sanctuary cities and border security.  Chief correspondent Jonathan  Hunt joins us now from Los Angeles.  Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  The  alleged killer of Ronil Singh was apparently trying to make a run for  Mexico.  But officers, aided by aerial surveillance, swept into arrest him  in Bakersfield, that's in central California, some 200 miles south of where  the shooting happened.  The arrest came just 48 hours after 33-year-old  officer Ronil Singh was gunned down.  He leaves behind his wife and 5- month-old son.  </p><p>Today, officer Singh's brother broke down as he thanked police and sheriff  deputies for finding the suspect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, OFFICER RONIL SINGH'S BROTHER:  There's a lot of people out  there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't  know that work days and nights to make this happen.  I'd like to thank you  from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  The suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was in the U.S. illegally,  according to the local sheriff, who angrily denounced California's so- called sanctuary laws, which the sheriff said prevented Perez Arriaga from  being deported for previous DUI convictions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, SHERIFF, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  This is a  criminal illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been  reported to ICE.  We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited  because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh.</p><p>I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Officer Singh was shot dead around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning after  stopping a driver on suspicion of DUI.  Moments later, he radioed, \"Shots  fired.  I've been hit.\"  He was a legal immigrant who had come to the U.S.  from Fiji where he was born.  He studied criminal justice once he got here,  and spent 12 years in law enforcement, seven of those with the Newman  Police Department.</p><p>He even took and paid for extra English lessons to help make himself better  understood by his colleagues.  The Newman Police Department, by the way,  Shannon, has just 12 officers.  A close-knit family, and the words of the  police chief, and a family that will never forget Ronil Singh.  Shannon?</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Jonathan, they got their suspects.  We'll watch this case  very closely.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen is in El Paso, Texas, where  an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy was detained with his father before dying in  government custody after two hospital visits.  Nielsen touring multiple  stations and substations operated by customs and border protection and  meeting with the MTs and other first responders.  Nielsen is scheduled to  move onto Yuma, Arizona, tomorrow.</p><p>Well, judging from his tweets, President Trump is keeping a close eye on  the border as he stays here in D.C., again this weekend.  Though nearly all  lawmakers are out of town, amidst this partial government shutdown.  Rich  Edson joins us now for the latest from the White House and the big island  of Hawaii.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  Too bad I'm  not going live from there.</p><p>BREAM:  I know.</p><p>EDSON:  But we'll make do with this.</p><p>BREAM:  Thanks for being with us though.</p><p>EDSON:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>So, you know, Shannon, there is no indication as partial government  shutdown ends this year.  Congress is mostly out of town.  President Trump  is still here, tweeting, quote, \"We will be forced to close the southern  border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to  finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our  country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve.\"</p><p>The president is also threatening again to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala,  and El Salvador, for failing to prevent their citizens from traveling  illegally to the U.S. border.</p><p>The White House and Democrats are a few billion dollars apart on funding  for border security.  President Trump insists on money for a wall, house  Democrats say the president's wall proposal is immoral, ineffective, and  expensive.</p><p>Republicans are now trying to pin shutdown blame on House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi saying she's refusing to negotiate on wall funding to appear  to liberal House Democrats and to assure their support in her race for  speaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  She does not have the  votes and if she cuts a deal with the president, of any sort before her  election on January 3rd, she's at risk of losing her speakership.  So we're  in this for the long haul.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  Republicans are also pointing to a story published in the  Washington Free Beacon, claiming Pelosi is spending the shutdown  vacationing at a luxury resort in Hawaii.  Pelosi's office has refused to  confirm or deny this story.</p><p>Our Capitol Hill team says leaders from both parties haven't been seen  lately on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Republicans say Democrats have shutdown negotiations, Democrats say the  shut down should have never happened.  New York congressman and Democratic  caucus chairman, Hakeem Jeffries tweets, quote, \"Day seven of the Trump  shutdown, Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage.  We  refuse to pay $5 billion ransom note, in other words, take a hike.\"</p><p>Congressional leaders say they'll give members at least 24 hours notice to  return to Washington to vote on any agreement to fund the government.   Shannon?</p><p>BREAM:  Unlikely before next Thursday.  But we're all be ready if it  happens.  Thanks, Rich.</p><p>All right.  Let's bring in tonight's \"Power Panel.\"  Fox news contributor,  Jehmu Greene.  Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto.  And  Fox News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good evening.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I want to play a little bit more of what the sheriff had today  -- to say today about the fact that California has a sanctuary state  policies and it makes his job tougher.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIANSON:  Suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p>Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals?  Gang members.  It's a  conversation we need to have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Jehmu, your reaction?</p><p>GREENE:  Well, first, and definitely foremost, you think about the family  and prayers go out to the family, to the community.  And it's really  important I think in these times that you don't use a crime like this to  demonize all undocumented immigrants.</p><p>We want this murderer to have justice that is swift and harsh.  But that  certainly does not mean that there is link of criminality to the rest of  undocumented immigrants, as some -- </p><p>BREAM:  And I don't think anyone is making that suggestion.</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No one's heard that.  Where  did that come from?</p><p>GREENE:  Many Republicans want that to be the case, when the reality is,  undocumented immigrants in this country commit considerably less crimes.   Considerably less crimes than native born -- </p><p>BREAM:  But what we're talking about is this one situation where  apparently, according to the law enforcement officials involved that this  man should not have been in the country.  He had previous DUI arrests.   That he came here illegally.</p><p>So in the case of this family and this slain officer, Gianno, we're talking  about somebody that potentially, the state's on policies allowed this or  cases like this, to happen.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes.  I'm incredibly disappointed with my dear colleague Jehmu's  rhetoric on this issue.  This is a safety issue plain and simple.  It's not  a partisan issue.  If you look at the pure numbers, 74 percent of  individuals that were brought in by ICE.  In 2017, had previous felony  convictions.</p><p>We talk about the sanctuary city status of places like Chicago and the  state of California, which don't provide any funding for those that may be  -- that ICE may want to retain.  They may want to detain those individuals.   They can use any personnel for that.</p><p>So, yes, this is making our country less safe and certainly, this is  something that I said two days ago, on this very network, that Democrats  are going to have to own any criminality that's perpetrated by individuals.   They came into this country illegally because they refused to negotiate  what the president of the United States on border security.</p><p>So when you have a Congress, a democratic caucus who refused to negotiate,  when you have local elected officials who refused to follow the trend of --  if individuals are coming over here illegally and they are doing illegal  activities that could possibly harm U.S. citizens, like we just saw, that  they don't -- they don't buy into that.</p><p>So this is as very problematic.  And, Jehmu, I'm just so surprised and  disappointed with what you said.  I'm sorry.</p><p>GREENE:  Well, Shannon, there's the link right there that Gianno is trying  to make between criminality and undocumented immigrants, that is just not - - </p><p>CALDWELL:  I never said that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  Let me bring Art in here.  Because what we're talking about is --  we're talking about -- we're talking about this case and what clearly  happened here.</p><p>Now, Art, a lot of folks would say, both parties bear the blame.  Both of  them have been in control, at some point, the White House, the Senate, and  House, and have not gotten this fixed.  You know firsthand what's going on  at the border.</p><p>DHS Secretary Nielsen is there today to see for herself.  She's been there  many times before.  But Congress, it's up to them to fix this, regardless  of which party is in control, they don't seem to be able to get it done. </p><p>ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Being an  illegal in this country and the security of our nation's border has nothing  to do with what political party you are in.  First and foremost.</p><p>Now, this is a horrific, horrific incident that happened with this officer  dying, and it is 100 percent because of sanctuary cities.  It is 100  percent because what you do when you have these sanctuary cities is you  create a magnet for these individuals that like to break the law, which,  just by the fact that you're illegally in this country, you're already a  criminal, plain and simple.</p><p>People say, oh, well, he's just illegally in the country, he's not a  criminal.  No.  If he's illegally in the country, that makes him a  criminal.  And it is definitely at the hands of any single individual,  politician, or whoever that maybe that supports sanctuary cities.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, Jehmu, where do we go from here?  I mean, the  Democrats take over the House in January, just a week from now and they've  said the first thing they're going to do is refund the government, they're  not going to have any funding for the wall, so that's going to go to the  Senate.  If it makes it through their, to the president, he said he's not  going to sign anything that doesn't have funding for the wall.</p><p>I mean, where does this standoff end?</p><p>GREENE:  Well, I think one place we could go from here is to revisit some  of the policies that we saw in the Obama administration that were very much  focused on criminals that were here undocumented, and how to put in smarter  policies to target them, to track them, to find them, and to get them out  of the country.  When we look at how this administration is dealing with  immigration and throwing out mothers who have been here for 20 years with  no criminal record, and anyone who they come in contact with, that takes  away the focus.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  They're here illegally.  That's (INAUDIBLE) all on its own.</p><p>GREENE:  And so, yes, it would be -- it would be better to focus on those  criminals and get them out.</p><p>BREAM:  Art, I know you had something to say there.  I mean, this is part  of what you do and being a part of border patrol.  I mean, you've seen this  firsthand.  What's the reality?  Because listen, we know under the Obama  administration, he became known as the Deporter in Chief because they were  turning around so many people.</p><p>It wasn't a positive to a lot of people who supported President Obama, but  we know that these policies of turning people back of denying asylum  claims.  I mean, they aren't new.  Why are they reported and treated  differently now?</p><p>DEL CUETO:  Because these people care more about being angry at the  president than they do about the United States and the American citizens.   That's what it is.  That's the way I see it.</p><p>Look, I have skin in the game.  I'm out there in the field.  I'm out there  arresting some of these individuals, and it's easy to Monday morning  quarterback it, you know, behind a desk, and you know, Far East.  It's easy  to Monday morning quarterback it.</p><p>President Trump has done everything possible to make sure that this country  moves forward and that there's border security.  And that's the reality of  the entire situation.</p><p>He's a president that has reached out to the National Border Patrol  council.  He's on point with everything he says.  And everyone needs to get  on the same page because it's getting frustrating to see so many people  that really don't care about the American public or about our borders,  about border security.</p><p>And even with the shutdown.  I have skin in the game, as I said before.  We  don't know when or if our next paycheck is going to come.  And I've been  misquoted and some of the media, or some of my words have been twisted.   And I can tell you right now, the National Border Patrol Council, which I  am a part of, fully support the president and fully support the shutdown,  if that's what the president is asking for.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Gianno, I want to -- </p><p>CALDWELL:  If I can really quickly jump in there.  I know that you --  really quickly.</p><p>BREAM:  Sure.  Go ahead.</p><p>CALDWELL:  So to your same question to him, the reason why we see like  nothing being done, I think Democrats have seen, especially some of our  Latino brothers and sisters that are coming in, as a power base for them.</p><p>So we think about in 2006 when Senator Barack Obama said on the floor of  the Senate that we needed the Secure Fence Act, which 26 Democrats voted in  favor of it.  Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer himself, they talked about  border security in a positive way back then.</p><p>But now that we see that there is an influx and now Latinos are going to be  the new minority, the new major minority, I think they're seeing this as a  potential power block for them so they might as well support anything  that's going to keep these voters happy.</p><p>GREENE:  That is so false.  That is so false and unfair.</p><p>BREAM:  Gianno, the Republicans have control of the White House, the House  and Senate for the last two years and their base wants to know why they  didn't get something done.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And that -- and that's a -- that's a very good question.  I  think we didn't have enough votes in the Senate to actually get something  passed.  Similar to that, you have to work with Democrats on it.  Think  about what President Trump offered the deal in terms of DACA.  Democrats  didn't even take it, they didn't want to take it off the table because they  wanted to keep the issue alive for the midterm elections and that's exactly  what they did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GREENE:  Jehmu, the President keeps reneging on his deals.  First it was  $1.3 billion for a wall, then it's $2.5 billion for a wall.  With DACA,  he's reneged on so many deals.  If this President is about making deals,  you have to be a man of your word.  He sent Vice President Pence out to  front for him and then reneged on that deal.  How can you get to a place of  compromise and understanding if the President can't even keep his word on  this issue? </p><p>BREAM:  Well, he's -- listen, he's asked for a lot more than that.  He and  now several others in the White House say they are offering compromise  deals, they've heard nothing back and don't expect they will from the  Democrats until Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.  So one week from today, maybe  we'll have this conversation again and see if the government is reopened or  what's happening.  In the meantime, Jehmu, Art, and Gianno, thank you, all.   Appreciate your time.  </p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.  </p><p>GREENE:  Thanks.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The Florida Sun Sentinel publishing a bombshell report  tonight on the Parkland School shooting massacre in February this year.   It's headline this, unprepared and overwhelmed.  The paper goes on to  report the two decades after Columbine at five years after Sandy Hook,  educators and police still weren't ready for Parkland.  Surveillance video  and the reports shows the killer Nikolas Cruz in the beginning moments of  the massacre telling another student, \"you better get out of here, things  are going to get messy.\"</p><p>And pulls out the AR-15 and begins shooting.  The video also shows Deputy  Scott Peterson, the school resource officer, the only armed law man on the  campus as he reportedly -- the paper says, failed to go inside the building  despite shots being fired.  He ordered a school lockdown instead of  ordering deputies toward the building.  Later revealed in this report that  officers \"may rush toward gunfire rather than shout\" according to policy  there in Broward County.</p><p>Well, pushback on one of President Trump's nominees to a key federal agency  by a member of his own party.  We're going to tell you why.  Senator Mike  Lee is trying to block the nominee because of what he says is a religious  freedom issue.  And Tony Perkins, president of the research -- Family  Research Council joins and he's going to weigh in on why this nominee is so  controversial. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Republican Senator Mike Lee is taking a stand against one of  President Trump's nominees to a key Federal agency.  The controversy is  pretty much flown under the radar in the middle of the government shutdown  but for the right and the left, there are some big issues at stake here  from traditional marriage to workplace discrimination.  Correspondent David  Spunt is here to tell us why Senator Lee is blocking his own president --  his own party's nominee.  </p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Shannon, it's a quite a story.   As you know, the EEOC is there to protect people's civil rights in the  workplace and Chai Feldblum, she's not new to the agency.  She's been a  commissioner since 2010, receiving support from both Republicans and  Democrats.  In fact, President Trump renominated her to her post just a  year ago.  Tonight she's defending her name as Senator Lee says, he'll  really do whatever he can do to make sure that she is out of a job.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I object to her confirmation.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Utah Senator Mike Lee is making it clear he wants EEOC Commissioner  Chai Feldblum out over concerns about her stance on religious liberty.  He  is prepared for a fight.  </p><p>LEE:  The Federal government should never, Mr. President, be used as a tool  to stamp out religious liberty.  That principle is so central to our  nation's founding and human happiness itself.  It's so important that we've  got to stand behind it.  Mrs. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly  that.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Feldblum is the first and only openly gay EEOC commissioner who was  quoted in a 2006 article as saying she had difficult time finding any case  in which religious liberty should win over sexual liberty.  Feldblum claims  she was misquoted, and put out this written statement over lee's position.   Senator Lee and others may feel they have kept a rabid opponent to  religious liberty off the equal employment opportunity commission.</p><p>They are wrong.  It is true that they have ensured that someone who cares  deeply about both religious liberty and LGBT rights won't protecting those  interests from the perch of the EEOC.  But I have fought from the civil  rights for LGBT people, religious people, and others for years.  I won't be  stopping now.  Feldblum went on to tell Fox News in an e-mail, Senator Lee  refused to meet with me when I asked to do so.</p><p>Perhaps that is why he does not know what I actually believe.  In 2009,  Feldblum defended religious liberty.  </p><p>CHAI FELDBLUM, COMMISSIONER, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION:  I  also have a deep respect for and understanding of religious practice, and a  deep-seated tolerance for religious difference.  </p><p>SPUNT:  Washington Democrat Senator Patty Murray says Feldblum must be  confirmed for the sake of millions of employees across the country.  </p><p>SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D), WASHINGTON:  Because of the objection of a single  Republican Senator, it is possible now that the EEOC will be unable to  deduct some of its most critical work.  </p><p>SPUNT:  But Lee says he'll continue to fight to protect religious liberty,  a concept he believes the EEOC should welcome.  </p><p>LEE:  Who is she to decide whether or not someone should be permitted to  persist in their own religious beliefs?  Simply because those beliefs  happen to conflict with a particular political worldview?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  And speaking of religious beliefs and an e-mail tonight, Feldblum  told me that her late father was a proud rabbi.  Shannon, he said -- she  said he would be very upset to see exactly the way she is being portrayed  right now in the media.  Especially by Senator Lee with this whole  situation going on.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Well, we'll keep an eye on it because I guess her  commission essentially expires New Year's eve if the Senate doesn't do  something and they're not here, so --</p><p>SPUNT:  They're not here and there's a lot of questions about how the EEOC  is going to operate for those millions of people around the country if she  is not in.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  David, thank you.</p><p>SPUNT:  You bet.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Joining us now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research  Council to talk about this.  Tony, welcome.  </p><p>TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL:  Thanks, Shannon.  Good  to be with you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to play a little bit more of Senator Lee's  critique.  And then some response from the Ms. Feldblum.  So here is the  Senator.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LEE:  Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious  belief and LGBT liberty as \"a zero-sum game,\" where \"a gain for one side  necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.\"  I see no  reason why that should be the case, and I think that's fundamentally  incompatible with our nation's long tradition of pluralism and religious  freedom.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So, Tony, here is her response.  In part she says, it's an out  of context quote that suggests I believe there is a zero-sum game between  religious liberty and LGBT rights.  And that LGBT rights must always  prevail no matter what, that is not my position, and never has been.  I  care deeply about preserving religious pluralism in our country even if  that means protecting religious organizations whose views I disagree with.   That is the point of pluralism.</p><p>OK.  What is getting lost in translation here?  </p><p>PERKINS:  Well, I think we've got to put it into context first and I know  Chai Feldblum.  She actually -- she actually spoke at the Family Research  Council.  I invited her one to come and speak on the panel and she made  comments reflecting this coming collision between religious freedom and  sexual liberty.  And she then suggested that she saw that religious liberty  would lose.</p><p>But she is also the architect of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,  which Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.  Now this is -- this is  literally sacrificing our vibrant first amendment on the altar of sexual  libertinism.  And she was unable to get that through Congress.  So Barack  Obama appointed her to the EEOC.  Couldn't got her -- actually get her  through the Senate when Harry Reid was the majority leader so he did a  recess appointment.</p><p>She was subsequently after Harry Reid changed the rules where only a  majority were need for presidential nominees, so she's been controversial  even to her own party.  She has taken positions that are 180 degrees from  the Trump administration when it comes to religious freedom.  And so it is  -- I applaud Senator Mike Lee, spoken with him a number of times about this  particular case and I applaud him for taking a stand in defense of  religious liberty.</p><p>She reflects an era of the past, the Barack Obama era of hostility toward  religious freedom.  We don't need her on the EEOC leading that commission  forward.  </p><p>BREAM:  But Tony, you know how this works obviously.  I mean, the President  has the opportunity to appoint members, the majority of members, three to  two, so you have five members of the EEOC that represent his majority party  but he goes to the Democrats for their nominations and their suggestions on  the other two members.  She is already a current sitting member of the  commission.</p><p>So he's basically following up with what the Democrats want which is to  keep her there.  Now there is this issue as we talk about with David, that  her commission expires December 31st.  If the Senate doesn't take action  clearly it doesn't appear that there is any way they're going to.  Mitch  McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, could force a vote.  Here is what a  statement from (INAUDIBLE) vice president.</p><p>Here's what they say.  Americans need a fully functional EEOC to combat  discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.  And Mike Lee's  anti-LGBTQ views should not stand in the ways of those seeking justice  under the law.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should abide by set  President and immediately hold a full Senate vote on the EEOC nominees were  fair-minded voices will prevail.  Do you McConnell is going to do that?  </p><p>PERKINS:  No, I don't.  I don't think he should.  First off, we have to  look at what the advantage she has as a returning member of the commission.   I served on the Federal Commission, I know those existing members kind of  influence the new members.  But you have to consider the EEOC is actually  lined up in Federal court against the Trump administration's own Department  of Justice on the redefinition of terms such as sexual discrimination, what  sex means.</p><p>Where -- this is furthering the lawlessness of the Obama administration  where they unilaterally change the terms of the 1964 antidiscrimination law  and civil rights law and the 1974 title VII as it pertains to employment.   They have just unilaterally redefined those terms.  She's doing that by  bureaucratic fiat.  So I think Mitch McConnell would be wrong to move  forward with this.  I think Mike Lee is taking the right position.  I don't  think the President really is pushing this.</p><p>I think you're right.  It was giving the Democrats -- somebody in the White  House said let's just give him what they want.  Chuck Schumer wanted her.   I think she needs to be off the commission.  </p><p>BREAM:  Well, having practiced labor and employment law in the past, I know  exactly how much power the EEOC wields.  And, you know, you have to ask  questions about Congress, about how much power has been delegated to these  Federal agencies because they don't answer to the people, they're unelected  and they do have quite a bit of power.  So, we'll keep an eye on it, we'll  track it and we'll have Senator Lee here in the New Year to come talk to us  about it as well.  Tony, thank you very much.  Happy New Year.  </p><p>PERKINS:  Happy New Year, Shannon.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Up next, big tech is in the crosshairs.  Congress  expected her face off against social media prepping new regulations and  potential oversight on content and privacy when lawmakers get back in the  New Year.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have to put some rules of the road in place.  We - - they can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BREAM:  Plus, a look back at the winners and losers on Capitol Hill.   Congress' 2018 year in review.  Chad Pergram's by the numbers when we  return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  No sign that Congress will vote anytime soon on ending a partial  government shutdown.  Reopening the government will likely fall to the new  congress, 116th, which starts next Thursday at noon.  So, what exactly did  the 115th Congress actually managed to get done?  Back by popular demand,  Fox News Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram is here to break it down  by the numbers.  Chad?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Shannon, 2018 marks  the end of one of those rare times Republicans control the House and  Senate.  So, it's a good time to take stock of what the GOP did and didn't  do.  Take the long the longtime GOP promise to repeal and replace  Obamacare.  After one failed attempt, House Republicans finely muscled  through their own health care measure that then died in the United States  Senate.  Republicans re-engineered to the nation's tax system for the first  time in three decades.  </p><p>GDP topped four percent in the second quarter of 2018 for the first time in  four years.  Yearly, economic average growth is now on track to hit three  percent for the first time in 13 years.  Nevertheless, political observers  blame the tax law for Republicans losing house seats in New York, New  Jersey and California.  Residents could no longer deduct high local taxes  from their federal tax bill.  Congress never addressed an infrastructure  bill.  And there were a failed house bills to fund the border wall and  provide pathways to citizenship for some DACA recipients.  The president  had this message for those Republicans during a press conference in late  June.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think that's going to  be a great election point for us.  So, I told them two hours ago, I said,  you're going to do what you want.  And ultimately, we'll come to something,  and perhaps, it will be after the election, maybe it will be before.  But  as of this moment, Democrats are not going to vote for anything because  they really are resisting or obstructing.  OK?  Thank you very much.  </p><p>PERGRAM:  There were bipartisan successes.  Democrats in the House and  Senate finally got together on a long-awaited reform to the nation's  criminal justice system.  The law eliminates mandatory sentences, give  inmates better training to reenter society ready to work.  Lawmakers  approved a major bill addressing the nation's opioid crisis.  And even  though part of the government is now closed, the Senate moved at its  fastest clip in decades on annual spending bills.  That's why this is a  partial government shutdown.  Congress worked out the details on five of  the 12 appropriations bills months ago.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell often declared that the Senate is in the personnel business.  </p><p>The Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees, including the knockdown,  drag out fight over Brett Kavanaugh, also 32 circuit court judges and 51  district court judges.  We all learned in fifth grade that Congress is  designed to pass law -- quite the opposite.  The founders created Congress  to stop law.  Consider this: lawmakers introduced 13,549 bills this  Congress, 338 became law, that's 0.02 percent.  329 bills became law in the  last Congress.  And one bill, not destined to become a law this Congress  legislation, to fund the approximate quarter of the government now held in  limbo during the spending fight on a border wall.  Shannon? </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much.  We'll see you what  2019 brings.  When it comes to cybersecurity, a year in review might  highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even question  over bias and social media content.  And as Correspondent Gillian Turner  reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and  online security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown is an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.  First up,  regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the  big three social media companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google owned  YouTube.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the road  in place.  They can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p>TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news faster than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on:  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.  </p><p>Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about: data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They're taking  cues from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refuse to  decrypt their data for investigators.  </p><p>\"Companies are in the business of generating profit.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns but it's  important to understand that what's good for a technology company isn't  necessarily good for America.\"  Democrats are focused on protecting  Americans privacy.  They worry if investigators can access any encrypted  data they want, it will lead to abuses in the future.  </p><p>2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.  Breaches  of Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Here's hoping  2019 is more secure.  Shannon?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Sounds good, Gillian Turner, thank you very much.  New laws for the  new year, that's where we're headed in tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"   Starting January 1st, Washington State will begin imposing fines on people  who try to pass off ordinary pets as service animals.  Maximum penalty,  $250.  Meanwhile in California, judges will be able to decide who gets  custody of a pet during a divorce proceeding.  Judges will take into  account who takes care of the pet and feeds them.  </p><p>Tough gun control measures will go on the books in Illinois this year, they  include a 72-hour waiting period on all gun purchases.  Another new law  will allow family members or police to ask a judge to temporally remove  guns from someone they think is a threat to themselves or others.  </p><p>In Tennessee, women will soon be required to get an ultrasound before  getting an abortion.  The doctor performing the ultrasound must also let  the woman know the results of the test, namely whether or not a heartbeat  is detected.  Doctors will also be required to put that information into  the patient's medical records.  </p><p>President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria still being questioned by  members of both parties.  But the president now has an unlikely ally -- a  former high-ranking Obama official.  That story is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.   It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.   But as Lucas Tomlinson reports, the Trump administration's new plan has  support from a former senior Obama official.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Syrian forces move to the  outskirts of a Kurdish-held city captured from ISIS, putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's  forces closed in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal  of U.S. forces from the country.  But the Kurds say, they welcome the  Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion  after their U.S. allies leave.  Turkey's president says, he wants the  Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.  </p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave, then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States with President  Trump, whom I spoke to recently, and Russia, continues healthily.  </p><p>TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out: \"Holding Northeastern Syria would  not have been enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams, can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler  about our abilities, especially in the face of sustained, widespread  regional hostility.\" </p><p>Seven years after the start of Syria civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  The Gulf States are long opposed to his rule are coming  back to Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in  Syria, one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.  U.S. officials  tell me, there's no immediate plans to withdraw any American troops from  Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from a country could take months.   Shannon?  </p><p>BREAM:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon, thank you.  Impassioned pleas for  32 migrants who remained stranded in the Mediterranean, that leads  tonight's \"WHERE IN THE WORLD.\"  The German nonprofit sea-watch making an  impassioned appeal to E.U. states after no European nation agreed to take  in 32 migrants who've been stranded at sea for the past week.  The group  rescued the migrants mainly from Nigeria, Libya, and Ivory Coast, December  22nd, just 24 hours after another group rescued more than 300 migrants who  were eventually taken in by Spain.  </p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  pyramid, killing at least three people and wounding ten others.  The  countries battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack  to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.  </p><p>And Cuban officials are preparing to roll out fresh austerity measures as  the cash-strapped nation continues to experience the weak economic growth,  following export revenue and rising debt.  Cuba's economy has averaged a  one percent annual growth over the past three years.  Foreign trade has  also fallen by about 25 percent during that same period.  </p><p>All right, does buying a ticket to a sporting event give you the right to  cuss out the players?  Well, one fan says, security roughed him up when he  used foul language and he is now taking them to court.  Our legal eagles,  Marjorie and David are standing by to present their cases.  You are the  jury.  \"NIGHT COURT\" is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  It is time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\"  Another rocket docket, we're  going to try to get through two cases here.  First up, a Guatemalan family  suing Universal theme park in Orlando.  They say the park needs more  bilingual signs because the family's 38-year-old father died of a heart  attack two years ago after ridding to the skull island attraction.  The  family says a sign in English warning that it's a ride through Kingkong's  natural habitat and people with heart condition shouldn't risk it.  They  said, well, there wasn't a sign in Spanish.  </p><p>Now, the other case, New York Giants fans suing in a San Jose, California  court for the right to curse at players and flip them off.  These fans say  their First Amendment rights were violated last year by police officers and  security there after they flipped off Giants players and told them they  \"blanking suck\" -- that's a quote.  These are Giants fans, they were angry  that their team was losing.  So, tonight's legal eagles to weigh in and  remember you're the jury: Marjorie Mesidor and David Bruno, thank you both  for joining us tonight.  </p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Hello, Shannon.</p><p>MARJORIE MESIDOR, PARTNER, PHILLIPS &amp; ASSOCIATES PLLC:  Thank you for  having us.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK, because we just showed a little video there.  Let's start with  the Giants case.  They were at the game, they were yelling at their own  players because they were so mad that they were losing this game.  The  police say that they were warned, they need to calm down, quit cursing at  the players, without language, the flipping them off and it didn't work.   They eventually ended up getting arrested.  Let's get into a little bit of  this.  </p><p>A report afterwards, \"The Captain Wahid Kazem of the Santa Clara Police  Department saying this, that Patrick Flynn -- one of the plaintiffs in the  case -- was belligerent, intoxicated and clearly violating the stadium's  code of conduct.  Kazem said that Patrick Flynn and Kyle Flynn, his  brother, had been warned about their behavior, they were being ejected from  the stadium when Kazem said they became uncooperative and physically  resistant.  The officers refused to leave their seats.\"  Marjorie, that's  the one side of the story.  How do you respond?  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Well, when it -- when we're talking about issues of drunkenness  and disorderly conduct and the like, that, in and of itself, there's no  first amendment violation they are.  But if we're just talking about the  speech, whether or not they had a right to flip off to the players, et  cetera, essentially, the First Amendment says that all speech, all those  that don't fall into a particular exception, is essentially protected.  </p><p>They interfered with that speech with the arrest, and essentially you have  to then look at whether or not the limitation of that speech was justified  by the fact that they want a safe environment.  I don't think they're going  to be able to show that it fell into one of the five exceptions of speech  that is excluded from freedom of speech.  It's not inciting a riot, it's  not criminal, it's not criminal speech, it's not obscenity in terms of the  way that the law looks at obscenity.  It's not pornography or any one of  those things.  So, I think that they have a decent case here to say that  there's a First Amendment violation.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK, part of their complaint says this, \"The force used against the  plaintiffs was excessive, unreasonable, without cause and with deliberate  indifference to their health and safety.\"  You saw at one point, one of the  guys flips over one of the railings there.  Plaintiffs suffered bodily  injury, physical pain, emotional distress and deprivation of their  constitutional rights.  David, you know, in going through this pleading --  they also talked about the fact that one of the guys was taken into this  holding area, he was put into a body wrap for 30 to 40 minutes, completely  immobilizing him.  I mean, this think really ratcheted up quickly it sounds  like.  </p><p>BRUNO:  I think they have better claims about the injuries and the way that  they are treated by the police than the First Amendment.  Just getting back  to the First Amendment briefly, this is a private place, it's a private  stadium and the officer in that stadium used the word's code of conduct.   Code of conduct prevents these people from acting unruly.  So, security can  detain, they could take them out, they could ask you to leave, they are  allowed to do that.  </p><p>On the injuries, while police have to act reasonable, and I'm sure the  defense of the police officers is going to be -- well, they were resisting.   That's what they were initially charged with.  When somebody is resisting,  it's not a good scene, does not look good, I've seen it on video.  I did  not see this one particularly but that is going to be the perspective and  the defense from the police.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I get a little crazy at college football games myself, never  arrested, though -- just for the record.  OK, to this other case now at the  theme park, I want to work through this.  The family attorney suing  Universal says, \"It's not a crazy request that you would have signs in  different languages, it's actually quite basic in this day age.\"  They  said, \"You're asking for international travelers, this is a mecca for  tourism -- talking about Central Florida -- this is a very basic thing that  should be thought up for the safety of patrons.\"  David?  </p><p>BRUNO:  Yes, I disagree that they legally have to do it.  Is it a good  idea?  Yes, I think it's a good idea.  But to file a lawsuit and claim that  this Orlando theme park was negligent in not posting a Spanish sign, I  disagree.  The fact of the matter is, 72 million visitors came to the  Orlando theme parks outside of the United States and they're from all  different languages.  It's not just a Spanish.  In addition, they had an  English warning and there were also pictures that went with that.  It's not  just Spanish.  Pictures probably were enough to give this guy notice.  But  you know what, he was going on the right anyway.  </p><p>BREAM:  Marjorie, I want to give the final word here on this case.  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Well, for me, it's simply an issue of whether or not they had a  duty of care.  What is a point of having a sign if everyone who is  attending this theme park can't read it or interact with it?  The fact of  the matter is, is that there are 41 million Spanish speakers in the United  States, there's over a million who come in from outside countries, mostly  predominantly Spanish-speaking countries.  It's not a one-off that a place  like Universal Studios or a theme park like this one would have a Spanish  sign in Spanish for these kinds of warnings, especially if it's a health  risk.  Safety is a safety issue for everyone, not just for the English  speakers and for -- in addressing this issue that they really should have  it in both languages.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Marjorie and David, thank you for making your  arguments.  We appreciate your time tonight.  We put it to the jury.  Let  us know what you think @FoxNewsNight or @ShannonBream, you'll weigh in.   Thanks, guys.  </p><p>MESIDOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  And tonight, we end on a very somber note.  We would like to pay  tribute and say farewell to Bre Payton, she'd been a guest on our program,  she was a very close friend with our lead writer who is obviously, like so  many other people today, devastated by the news that this beautiful 26- year-old woman, brilliant and smart, suddenly passed away today in San  Diego.</p><p>Bre was a writer for The Federalist news site.  Her family, friends, and  colleagues are all shocked at her death.  We're told possibly H1N1 flu or  meningitis was involved.  A little bit early at this point, but our prayers  are with her and her friends and family.  They've set up a scholarship fund  that will go towards those supporting young, rising Christian leaders.  We  remember Bre tonight.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's been an honor and a privilege to guest host  tonight.  But stay tuned for Shannon Bream's show.  You're going to love  it.  Thank you again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  This is a Fox News alert.  This could have  been preventable.  Those words from a grieving California sheriff after an  officer was gunned down in cold blood.  The sheriff says, by an illegal  alien, running from a drunk driving stop.  The sheriff putting part of the  blame on California's sanctuary policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly enjoying the big island of Hawaii  amid the partial government shutdown in the battle over border security.   She's not alone in escaping the beltway but could lawmakers actually get  something done since the president is here and he says he's waiting on  them?  We'll debate.</p><p> And there's a fight over religious liberty and LGBTQ rights over  controversial nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  She  claims she's being unfairly targeted and misquoted.  A Republican senator  says she's against religious liberty.  Tony Perkins from the Family  Research Council will weigh in.</p><p> Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.   We begin with a tragedy sparking a national debate.  In simmering battles  over sanctuary cities and border security.  Chief correspondent Jonathan  Hunt joins us now from Los Angeles.  Hey, Jonathan.</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  The  alleged killer of Ronil Singh was apparently trying to make a run for  Mexico.  But officers, aided by aerial surveillance, swept into arrest him  in Bakersfield, that's in central California, some 200 miles south of where  the shooting happened.  The arrest came just 48 hours after 33-year-old  officer Ronil Singh was gunned down.  He leaves behind his wife and 5- month-old son.  </p><p> Today, officer Singh's brother broke down as he thanked police and sheriff  deputies for finding the suspect.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGGIE SINGH, OFFICER RONIL SINGH'S BROTHER:  There's a lot of people out  there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't  know that work days and nights to make this happen.  I'd like to thank you  from the bottom of my heart.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT:  The suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was in the U.S. illegally,  according to the local sheriff, who angrily denounced California's so- called sanctuary laws, which the sheriff said prevented Perez Arriaga from  being deported for previous DUI convictions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM CHRISTIANSON, SHERIFF, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  This is a  criminal illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been  reported to ICE.  We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited  because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh.</p><p> I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT:  Officer Singh was shot dead around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning after  stopping a driver on suspicion of DUI.  Moments later, he radioed, \"Shots  fired.  I've been hit.\"  He was a legal immigrant who had come to the U.S.  from Fiji where he was born.  He studied criminal justice once he got here,  and spent 12 years in law enforcement, seven of those with the Newman  Police Department.</p><p> He even took and paid for extra English lessons to help make himself better  understood by his colleagues.  The Newman Police Department, by the way,  Shannon, has just 12 officers.  A close-knit family, and the words of the  police chief, and a family that will never forget Ronil Singh.  Shannon?</p><p> BREAM:  Well, Jonathan, they got their suspects.  We'll watch this case  very closely.  Thank you very much.</p><p> Homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen is in El Paso, Texas, where  an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy was detained with his father before dying in  government custody after two hospital visits.  Nielsen touring multiple  stations and substations operated by customs and border protection and  meeting with the MTs and other first responders.  Nielsen is scheduled to  move onto Yuma, Arizona, tomorrow.</p><p> Well, judging from his tweets, President Trump is keeping a close eye on  the border as he stays here in D.C., again this weekend.  Though nearly all  lawmakers are out of town, amidst this partial government shutdown.  Rich  Edson joins us now for the latest from the White House and the big island  of Hawaii.</p><p> RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  Too bad I'm  not going live from there.</p><p> BREAM:  I know.</p><p> EDSON:  But we'll make do with this.</p><p> BREAM:  Thanks for being with us though.</p><p> EDSON:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p> So, you know, Shannon, there is no indication as partial government  shutdown ends this year.  Congress is mostly out of town.  President Trump  is still here, tweeting, quote, \"We will be forced to close the southern  border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to  finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our  country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve.\"</p><p> The president is also threatening again to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala,  and El Salvador, for failing to prevent their citizens from traveling  illegally to the U.S. border.</p><p> The White House and Democrats are a few billion dollars apart on funding  for border security.  President Trump insists on money for a wall, house  Democrats say the president's wall proposal is immoral, ineffective, and  expensive.</p><p> Republicans are now trying to pin shutdown blame on House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi saying she's refusing to negotiate on wall funding to appear  to liberal House Democrats and to assure their support in her race for  speaker.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  She does not have the  votes and if she cuts a deal with the president, of any sort before her  election on January 3rd, she's at risk of losing her speakership.  So we're  in this for the long haul.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON:  Republicans are also pointing to a story published in the  Washington Free Beacon, claiming Pelosi is spending the shutdown  vacationing at a luxury resort in Hawaii.  Pelosi's office has refused to  confirm or deny this story.</p><p> Our Capitol Hill team says leaders from both parties haven't been seen  lately on Capitol Hill.</p><p> Republicans say Democrats have shutdown negotiations, Democrats say the  shut down should have never happened.  New York congressman and Democratic  caucus chairman, Hakeem Jeffries tweets, quote, \"Day seven of the Trump  shutdown, Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage.  We  refuse to pay $5 billion ransom note, in other words, take a hike.\"</p><p> Congressional leaders say they'll give members at least 24 hours notice to  return to Washington to vote on any agreement to fund the government.   Shannon?</p><p> BREAM:  Unlikely before next Thursday.  But we're all be ready if it  happens.  Thanks, Rich.</p><p> All right.  Let's bring in tonight's \"Power Panel.\"  Fox news contributor,  Jehmu Greene.  Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto.  And  Fox News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p> JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good evening.</p><p> BREAM:  OK.  I want to play a little bit more of what the sheriff had today  -- to say today about the fact that California has a sanctuary state  policies and it makes his job tougher.  Here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTIANSON:  Suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law  enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because  of political interference.</p><p> Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals?  Gang members.  It's a  conversation we need to have.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM:  Jehmu, your reaction?</p><p> GREENE:  Well, first, and definitely foremost, you think about the family  and prayers go out to the family, to the community.  And it's really  important I think in these times that you don't use a crime like this to  demonize all undocumented immigrants.</p><p> We want this murderer to have justice that is swift and harsh.  But that  certainly does not mean that there is link of criminality to the rest of  undocumented immigrants, as some -- </p><p> BREAM:  And I don't think anyone is making that suggestion.</p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No one's heard that.  Where  did that come from?</p><p> GREENE:  Many Republicans want that to be the case, when the reality is,  undocumented immigrants in this country commit considerably less crimes.   Considerably less crimes than native born -- </p><p> BREAM:  But what we're talking about is this one situation where  apparently, according to the law enforcement officials involved that this  man should not have been in the country.  He had previous DUI arrests.   That he came here illegally.</p><p> So in the case of this family and this slain officer, Gianno, we're talking  about somebody that potentially, the state's on policies allowed this or  cases like this, to happen.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Yes.  I'm incredibly disappointed with my dear colleague Jehmu's  rhetoric on this issue.  This is a safety issue plain and simple.  It's not  a partisan issue.  If you look at the pure numbers, 74 percent of  individuals that were brought in by ICE.  In 2017, had previous felony  convictions.</p><p> We talk about the sanctuary city status of places like Chicago and the  state of California, which don't provide any funding for those that may be  -- that ICE may want to retain.  They may want to detain those individuals.   They can use any personnel for that.</p><p> So, yes, this is making our country less safe and certainly, this is  something that I said two days ago, on this very network, that Democrats  are going to have to own any criminality that's perpetrated by individuals.   They came into this country illegally because they refused to negotiate  what the president of the United States on border security.</p><p> So when you have a Congress, a democratic caucus who refused to negotiate,  when you have local elected officials who refused to follow the trend of --  if individuals are coming over here illegally and they are doing illegal  activities that could possibly harm U.S. citizens, like we just saw, that  they don't -- they don't buy into that.</p><p> So this is as very problematic.  And, Jehmu, I'm just so surprised and  disappointed with what you said.  I'm sorry.</p><p> GREENE:  Well, Shannon, there's the link right there that Gianno is trying  to make between criminality and undocumented immigrants, that is just not - - </p><p> CALDWELL:  I never said that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BREAM:  Let me bring Art in here.  Because what we're talking about is --  we're talking about -- we're talking about this case and what clearly  happened here.</p><p> Now, Art, a lot of folks would say, both parties bear the blame.  Both of  them have been in control, at some point, the White House, the Senate, and  House, and have not gotten this fixed.  You know firsthand what's going on  at the border.</p><p> DHS Secretary Nielsen is there today to see for herself.  She's been there  many times before.  But Congress, it's up to them to fix this, regardless  of which party is in control, they don't seem to be able to get it done. </p><p> ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Being an  illegal in this country and the security of our nation's border has nothing  to do with what political party you are in.  First and foremost.</p><p> Now, this is a horrific, horrific incident that happened with this officer  dying, and it is 100 percent because of sanctuary cities.  It is 100  percent because what you do when you have these sanctuary cities is you  create a magnet for these individuals that like to break the law, which,  just by the fact that you're illegally in this country, you're already a  criminal, plain and simple.</p><p> People say, oh, well, he's just illegally in the country, he's not a  criminal.  No.  If he's illegally in the country, that makes him a  criminal.  And it is definitely at the hands of any single individual,  politician, or whoever that maybe that supports sanctuary cities.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  So, Jehmu, where do we go from here?  I mean, the  Democrats take over the House in January, just a week from now and they've  said the first thing they're going to do is refund the government, they're  not going to have any funding for the wall, so that's going to go to the  Senate.  If it makes it through their, to the president, he said he's not  going to sign anything that doesn't have funding for the wall.</p><p> I mean, where does this standoff end?</p><p> GREENE:  Well, I think one place we could go from here is to revisit some  of the policies that we saw in the Obama administration that were very much  focused on criminals that were here undocumented, and how to put in smarter  policies to target them, to track them, to find them, and to get them out  of the country.  When we look at how this administration is dealing with  immigration and throwing out mothers who have been here for 20 years with  no criminal record, and anyone who they come in contact with, that takes  away the focus.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  They're here illegally.  That's (INAUDIBLE) all on its own.</p><p> GREENE:  And so, yes, it would be -- it would be better to focus on those  criminals and get them out.</p><p> BREAM:  Art, I know you had something to say there.  I mean, this is part  of what you do and being a part of border patrol.  I mean, you've seen this  firsthand.  What's the reality?  Because listen, we know under the Obama  administration, he became known as the Deporter in Chief because they were  turning around so many people.</p><p> It wasn't a positive to a lot of people who supported President Obama, but  we know that these policies of turning people back of denying asylum  claims.  I mean, they aren't new.  Why are they reported and treated  differently now?</p><p> DEL CUETO:  Because these people care more about being angry at the  president than they do about the United States and the American citizens.   That's what it is.  That's the way I see it.</p><p> Look, I have skin in the game.  I'm out there in the field.  I'm out there  arresting some of these individuals, and it's easy to Monday morning  quarterback it, you know, behind a desk, and you know, Far East.  It's easy  to Monday morning quarterback it.</p><p> President Trump has done everything possible to make sure that this country  moves forward and that there's border security.  And that's the reality of  the entire situation.</p><p> He's a president that has reached out to the National Border Patrol  council.  He's on point with everything he says.  And everyone needs to get  on the same page because it's getting frustrating to see so many people  that really don't care about the American public or about our borders,  about border security.</p><p> And even with the shutdown.  I have skin in the game, as I said before.  We  don't know when or if our next paycheck is going to come.  And I've been  misquoted and some of the media, or some of my words have been twisted.   And I can tell you right now, the National Border Patrol Council, which I  am a part of, fully support the president and fully support the shutdown,  if that's what the president is asking for.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Gianno, I want to -- </p><p> CALDWELL:  If I can really quickly jump in there.  I know that you --  really quickly.</p><p> BREAM:  Sure.  Go ahead.</p><p> CALDWELL:  So to your same question to him, the reason why we see like  nothing being done, I think Democrats have seen, especially some of our  Latino brothers and sisters that are coming in, as a power base for them.</p><p> So we think about in 2006 when Senator Barack Obama said on the floor of  the Senate that we needed the Secure Fence Act, which 26 Democrats voted in  favor of it.  Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer himself, they talked about  border security in a positive way back then.</p><p> But now that we see that there is an influx and now Latinos are going to be  the new minority, the new major minority, I think they're seeing this as a  potential power block for them so they might as well support anything  that's going to keep these voters happy.</p><p> GREENE:  That is so false.  That is so false and unfair.</p><p> BREAM:  Gianno, the Republicans have control of the White House, the House  and Senate for the last two years and their base wants to know why they  didn't get something done.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And that -- and that's a -- that's a very good question.  I  think we didn't have enough votes in the Senate to actually get something  passed.  Similar to that, you have to work with Democrats on it.  Think  about what President Trump offered the deal in terms of DACA.  Democrats  didn't even take it, they didn't want to take it off the table because they  wanted to keep the issue alive for the midterm elections and that's exactly  what they did.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GREENE:  Jehmu, the President keeps reneging on his deals.  First it was  $1.3 billion for a wall, then it's $2.5 billion for a wall.  With DACA,  he's reneged on so many deals.  If this President is about making deals,  you have to be a man of your word.  He sent Vice President Pence out to  front for him and then reneged on that deal.  How can you get to a place of  compromise and understanding if the President can't even keep his word on  this issue? </p><p> BREAM:  Well, he's -- listen, he's asked for a lot more than that.  He and  now several others in the White House say they are offering compromise  deals, they've heard nothing back and don't expect they will from the  Democrats until Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.  So one week from today, maybe  we'll have this conversation again and see if the government is reopened or  what's happening.  In the meantime, Jehmu, Art, and Gianno, thank you, all.   Appreciate your time.  </p><p> CALDWELL: Thank you.  </p><p> GREENE:  Thanks.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  The Florida Sun Sentinel publishing a bombshell report  tonight on the Parkland School shooting massacre in February this year.   It's headline this, unprepared and overwhelmed.  The paper goes on to  report the two decades after Columbine at five years after Sandy Hook,  educators and police still weren't ready for Parkland.  Surveillance video  and the reports shows the killer Nikolas Cruz in the beginning moments of  the massacre telling another student, \"you better get out of here, things  are going to get messy.\"</p><p> And pulls out the AR-15 and begins shooting.  The video also shows Deputy  Scott Peterson, the school resource officer, the only armed law man on the  campus as he reportedly -- the paper says, failed to go inside the building  despite shots being fired.  He ordered a school lockdown instead of  ordering deputies toward the building.  Later revealed in this report that  officers \"may rush toward gunfire rather than shout\" according to policy  there in Broward County.</p><p> Well, pushback on one of President Trump's nominees to a key federal agency  by a member of his own party.  We're going to tell you why.  Senator Mike  Lee is trying to block the nominee because of what he says is a religious  freedom issue.  And Tony Perkins, president of the research -- Family  Research Council joins and he's going to weigh in on why this nominee is so  controversial. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  Republican Senator Mike Lee is taking a stand against one of  President Trump's nominees to a key Federal agency.  The controversy is  pretty much flown under the radar in the middle of the government shutdown  but for the right and the left, there are some big issues at stake here  from traditional marriage to workplace discrimination.  Correspondent David  Spunt is here to tell us why Senator Lee is blocking his own president --  his own party's nominee.  </p><p> DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Shannon, it's a quite a story.   As you know, the EEOC is there to protect people's civil rights in the  workplace and Chai Feldblum, she's not new to the agency.  She's been a  commissioner since 2010, receiving support from both Republicans and  Democrats.  In fact, President Trump renominated her to her post just a  year ago.  Tonight she's defending her name as Senator Lee says, he'll  really do whatever he can do to make sure that she is out of a job.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I object to her confirmation.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Utah Senator Mike Lee is making it clear he wants EEOC Commissioner  Chai Feldblum out over concerns about her stance on religious liberty.  He  is prepared for a fight.  </p><p> LEE:  The Federal government should never, Mr. President, be used as a tool  to stamp out religious liberty.  That principle is so central to our  nation's founding and human happiness itself.  It's so important that we've  got to stand behind it.  Mrs. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly  that.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Feldblum is the first and only openly gay EEOC commissioner who was  quoted in a 2006 article as saying she had difficult time finding any case  in which religious liberty should win over sexual liberty.  Feldblum claims  she was misquoted, and put out this written statement over lee's position.   Senator Lee and others may feel they have kept a rabid opponent to  religious liberty off the equal employment opportunity commission.</p><p> They are wrong.  It is true that they have ensured that someone who cares  deeply about both religious liberty and LGBT rights won't protecting those  interests from the perch of the EEOC.  But I have fought from the civil  rights for LGBT people, religious people, and others for years.  I won't be  stopping now.  Feldblum went on to tell Fox News in an e-mail, Senator Lee  refused to meet with me when I asked to do so.</p><p> Perhaps that is why he does not know what I actually believe.  In 2009,  Feldblum defended religious liberty.  </p><p> CHAI FELDBLUM, COMMISSIONER, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION:  I  also have a deep respect for and understanding of religious practice, and a  deep-seated tolerance for religious difference.  </p><p> SPUNT:  Washington Democrat Senator Patty Murray says Feldblum must be  confirmed for the sake of millions of employees across the country.  </p><p> SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D), WASHINGTON:  Because of the objection of a single  Republican Senator, it is possible now that the EEOC will be unable to  deduct some of its most critical work.  </p><p> SPUNT:  But Lee says he'll continue to fight to protect religious liberty,  a concept he believes the EEOC should welcome.  </p><p> LEE:  Who is she to decide whether or not someone should be permitted to  persist in their own religious beliefs?  Simply because those beliefs  happen to conflict with a particular political worldview?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPUNT:  And speaking of religious beliefs and an e-mail tonight, Feldblum  told me that her late father was a proud rabbi.  Shannon, he said -- she  said he would be very upset to see exactly the way she is being portrayed  right now in the media.  Especially by Senator Lee with this whole  situation going on.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Well, we'll keep an eye on it because I guess her  commission essentially expires New Year's eve if the Senate doesn't do  something and they're not here, so --</p><p> SPUNT:  They're not here and there's a lot of questions about how the EEOC  is going to operate for those millions of people around the country if she  is not in.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  David, thank you.</p><p> SPUNT:  You bet.</p><p> BREAM:  OK.  Joining us now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research  Council to talk about this.  Tony, welcome.  </p><p> TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL:  Thanks, Shannon.  Good  to be with you.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  I want to play a little bit more of Senator Lee's  critique.  And then some response from the Ms. Feldblum.  So here is the  Senator.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LEE:  Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious  belief and LGBT liberty as \"a zero-sum game,\" where \"a gain for one side  necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.\"  I see no  reason why that should be the case, and I think that's fundamentally  incompatible with our nation's long tradition of pluralism and religious  freedom.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BREAM:  OK.  So, Tony, here is her response.  In part she says, it's an out  of context quote that suggests I believe there is a zero-sum game between  religious liberty and LGBT rights.  And that LGBT rights must always  prevail no matter what, that is not my position, and never has been.  I  care deeply about preserving religious pluralism in our country even if  that means protecting religious organizations whose views I disagree with.   That is the point of pluralism.</p><p> OK.  What is getting lost in translation here?  </p><p> PERKINS:  Well, I think we've got to put it into context first and I know  Chai Feldblum.  She actually -- she actually spoke at the Family Research  Council.  I invited her one to come and speak on the panel and she made  comments reflecting this coming collision between religious freedom and  sexual liberty.  And she then suggested that she saw that religious liberty  would lose.</p><p> But she is also the architect of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,  which Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.  Now this is -- this is  literally sacrificing our vibrant first amendment on the altar of sexual  libertinism.  And she was unable to get that through Congress.  So Barack  Obama appointed her to the EEOC.  Couldn't got her -- actually get her  through the Senate when Harry Reid was the majority leader so he did a  recess appointment.</p><p> She was subsequently after Harry Reid changed the rules where only a  majority were need for presidential nominees, so she's been controversial  even to her own party.  She has taken positions that are 180 degrees from  the Trump administration when it comes to religious freedom.  And so it is  -- I applaud Senator Mike Lee, spoken with him a number of times about this  particular case and I applaud him for taking a stand in defense of  religious liberty.</p><p> She reflects an era of the past, the Barack Obama era of hostility toward  religious freedom.  We don't need her on the EEOC leading that commission  forward.  </p><p> BREAM:  But Tony, you know how this works obviously.  I mean, the President  has the opportunity to appoint members, the majority of members, three to  two, so you have five members of the EEOC that represent his majority party  but he goes to the Democrats for their nominations and their suggestions on  the other two members.  She is already a current sitting member of the  commission.</p><p> So he's basically following up with what the Democrats want which is to  keep her there.  Now there is this issue as we talk about with David, that  her commission expires December 31st.  If the Senate doesn't take action  clearly it doesn't appear that there is any way they're going to.  Mitch  McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, could force a vote.  Here is what a  statement from (INAUDIBLE) vice president.</p><p> Here's what they say.  Americans need a fully functional EEOC to combat  discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.  And Mike Lee's  anti-LGBTQ views should not stand in the ways of those seeking justice  under the law.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should abide by set  President and immediately hold a full Senate vote on the EEOC nominees were  fair-minded voices will prevail.  Do you McConnell is going to do that?  </p><p> PERKINS:  No, I don't.  I don't think he should.  First off, we have to  look at what the advantage she has as a returning member of the commission.   I served on the Federal Commission, I know those existing members kind of  influence the new members.  But you have to consider the EEOC is actually  lined up in Federal court against the Trump administration's own Department  of Justice on the redefinition of terms such as sexual discrimination, what  sex means.</p><p> Where -- this is furthering the lawlessness of the Obama administration  where they unilaterally change the terms of the 1964 antidiscrimination law  and civil rights law and the 1974 title VII as it pertains to employment.   They have just unilaterally redefined those terms.  She's doing that by  bureaucratic fiat.  So I think Mitch McConnell would be wrong to move  forward with this.  I think Mike Lee is taking the right position.  I don't  think the President really is pushing this.</p><p> I think you're right.  It was giving the Democrats -- somebody in the White  House said let's just give him what they want.  Chuck Schumer wanted her.   I think she needs to be off the commission.  </p><p> BREAM:  Well, having practiced labor and employment law in the past, I know  exactly how much power the EEOC wields.  And, you know, you have to ask  questions about Congress, about how much power has been delegated to these  Federal agencies because they don't answer to the people, they're unelected  and they do have quite a bit of power.  So, we'll keep an eye on it, we'll  track it and we'll have Senator Lee here in the New Year to come talk to us  about it as well.  Tony, thank you very much.  Happy New Year.  </p><p> PERKINS:  Happy New Year, Shannon.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Up next, big tech is in the crosshairs.  Congress  expected her face off against social media prepping new regulations and  potential oversight on content and privacy when lawmakers get back in the  New Year.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have to put some rules of the road in place.  We - - they can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BREAM:  Plus, a look back at the winners and losers on Capitol Hill.   Congress' 2018 year in review.  Chad Pergram's by the numbers when we  return.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  No sign that Congress will vote anytime soon on ending a partial  government shutdown.  Reopening the government will likely fall to the new  congress, 116th, which starts next Thursday at noon.  So, what exactly did  the 115th Congress actually managed to get done?  Back by popular demand,  Fox News Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram is here to break it down  by the numbers.  Chad?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Shannon, 2018 marks  the end of one of those rare times Republicans control the House and  Senate.  So, it's a good time to take stock of what the GOP did and didn't  do.  Take the long the longtime GOP promise to repeal and replace  Obamacare.  After one failed attempt, House Republicans finely muscled  through their own health care measure that then died in the United States  Senate.  Republicans re-engineered to the nation's tax system for the first  time in three decades.  </p><p> GDP topped four percent in the second quarter of 2018 for the first time in  four years.  Yearly, economic average growth is now on track to hit three  percent for the first time in 13 years.  Nevertheless, political observers  blame the tax law for Republicans losing house seats in New York, New  Jersey and California.  Residents could no longer deduct high local taxes  from their federal tax bill.  Congress never addressed an infrastructure  bill.  And there were a failed house bills to fund the border wall and  provide pathways to citizenship for some DACA recipients.  The president  had this message for those Republicans during a press conference in late  June.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think that's going to  be a great election point for us.  So, I told them two hours ago, I said,  you're going to do what you want.  And ultimately, we'll come to something,  and perhaps, it will be after the election, maybe it will be before.  But  as of this moment, Democrats are not going to vote for anything because  they really are resisting or obstructing.  OK?  Thank you very much.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  There were bipartisan successes.  Democrats in the House and  Senate finally got together on a long-awaited reform to the nation's  criminal justice system.  The law eliminates mandatory sentences, give  inmates better training to reenter society ready to work.  Lawmakers  approved a major bill addressing the nation's opioid crisis.  And even  though part of the government is now closed, the Senate moved at its  fastest clip in decades on annual spending bills.  That's why this is a  partial government shutdown.  Congress worked out the details on five of  the 12 appropriations bills months ago.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell often declared that the Senate is in the personnel business.  </p><p> The Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees, including the knockdown,  drag out fight over Brett Kavanaugh, also 32 circuit court judges and 51  district court judges.  We all learned in fifth grade that Congress is  designed to pass law -- quite the opposite.  The founders created Congress  to stop law.  Consider this: lawmakers introduced 13,549 bills this  Congress, 338 became law, that's 0.02 percent.  329 bills became law in the  last Congress.  And one bill, not destined to become a law this Congress  legislation, to fund the approximate quarter of the government now held in  limbo during the spending fight on a border wall.  Shannon? </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BREAM:  All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much.  We'll see you what  2019 brings.  When it comes to cybersecurity, a year in review might  highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even question  over bias and social media content.  And as Correspondent Gillian Turner  reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and  online security.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown is an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.  First up,  regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the  big three social media companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google owned  YouTube.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the road  in place.  They can't just say, hey, trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news faster than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on:  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.  </p><p> Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about: data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They're taking  cues from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refuse to  decrypt their data for investigators.  </p><p> \"Companies are in the business of generating profit.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns but it's  important to understand that what's good for a technology company isn't  necessarily good for America.\"  Democrats are focused on protecting  Americans privacy.  They worry if investigators can access any encrypted  data they want, it will lead to abuses in the future.  </p><p> 2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.  Breaches  of Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Here's hoping  2019 is more secure.  Shannon?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREAM:  Sounds good, Gillian Turner, thank you very much.  New laws for the  new year, that's where we're headed in tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"   Starting January 1st, Washington State will begin imposing fines on people  who try to pass off ordinary pets as service animals.  Maximum penalty,  $250.  Meanwhile in California, judges will be able to decide who gets  custody of a pet during a divorce proceeding.  Judges will take into  account who takes care of the pet and feeds them.  </p><p> Tough gun control measures will go on the books in Illinois this year, they  include a 72-hour waiting period on all gun purchases.  Another new law  will allow family members or police to ask a judge to temporally remove  guns from someone they think is a threat to themselves or others.  </p><p> In Tennessee, women will soon be required to get an ultrasound before  getting an abortion.  The doctor performing the ultrasound must also let  the woman know the results of the test, namely whether or not a heartbeat  is detected.  Doctors will also be required to put that information into  the patient's medical records.  </p><p> President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria still being questioned by  members of both parties.  But the president now has an unlikely ally -- a  former high-ranking Obama official.  That story is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  Troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.   It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.   But as Lucas Tomlinson reports, the Trump administration's new plan has  support from a former senior Obama official.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Syrian forces move to the  outskirts of a Kurdish-held city captured from ISIS, putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's  forces closed in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal  of U.S. forces from the country.  But the Kurds say, they welcome the  Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion  after their U.S. allies leave.  Turkey's president says, he wants the  Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.  </p><p> RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave, then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States with President  Trump, whom I spoke to recently, and Russia, continues healthily.  </p><p> TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out: \"Holding Northeastern Syria would  not have been enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams, can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler  about our abilities, especially in the face of sustained, widespread  regional hostility.\" </p><p> Seven years after the start of Syria civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  The Gulf States are long opposed to his rule are coming  back to Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in  Syria, one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.  U.S. officials  tell me, there's no immediate plans to withdraw any American troops from  Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from a country could take months.   Shannon?  </p><p> BREAM:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon, thank you.  Impassioned pleas for  32 migrants who remained stranded in the Mediterranean, that leads  tonight's \"WHERE IN THE WORLD.\"  The German nonprofit sea-watch making an  impassioned appeal to E.U. states after no European nation agreed to take  in 32 migrants who've been stranded at sea for the past week.  The group  rescued the migrants mainly from Nigeria, Libya, and Ivory Coast, December  22nd, just 24 hours after another group rescued more than 300 migrants who  were eventually taken in by Spain.  </p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  pyramid, killing at least three people and wounding ten others.  The  countries battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack  to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.  </p><p> And Cuban officials are preparing to roll out fresh austerity measures as  the cash-strapped nation continues to experience the weak economic growth,  following export revenue and rising debt.  Cuba's economy has averaged a  one percent annual growth over the past three years.  Foreign trade has  also fallen by about 25 percent during that same period.  </p><p> All right, does buying a ticket to a sporting event give you the right to  cuss out the players?  Well, one fan says, security roughed him up when he  used foul language and he is now taking them to court.  Our legal eagles,  Marjorie and David are standing by to present their cases.  You are the  jury.  \"NIGHT COURT\" is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  It is time now for \"NIGHT COURT.\"  Another rocket docket, we're  going to try to get through two cases here.  First up, a Guatemalan family  suing Universal theme park in Orlando.  They say the park needs more  bilingual signs because the family's 38-year-old father died of a heart  attack two years ago after ridding to the skull island attraction.  The  family says a sign in English warning that it's a ride through Kingkong's  natural habitat and people with heart condition shouldn't risk it.  They  said, well, there wasn't a sign in Spanish.  </p><p> Now, the other case, New York Giants fans suing in a San Jose, California  court for the right to curse at players and flip them off.  These fans say  their First Amendment rights were violated last year by police officers and  security there after they flipped off Giants players and told them they  \"blanking suck\" -- that's a quote.  These are Giants fans, they were angry  that their team was losing.  So, tonight's legal eagles to weigh in and  remember you're the jury: Marjorie Mesidor and David Bruno, thank you both  for joining us tonight.  </p><p> DAVID BRUNO, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Hello, Shannon.</p><p> MARJORIE MESIDOR, PARTNER, PHILLIPS &amp; ASSOCIATES PLLC:  Thank you for  having us.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK, because we just showed a little video there.  Let's start with  the Giants case.  They were at the game, they were yelling at their own  players because they were so mad that they were losing this game.  The  police say that they were warned, they need to calm down, quit cursing at  the players, without language, the flipping them off and it didn't work.   They eventually ended up getting arrested.  Let's get into a little bit of  this.  </p><p> A report afterwards, \"The Captain Wahid Kazem of the Santa Clara Police  Department saying this, that Patrick Flynn -- one of the plaintiffs in the  case -- was belligerent, intoxicated and clearly violating the stadium's  code of conduct.  Kazem said that Patrick Flynn and Kyle Flynn, his  brother, had been warned about their behavior, they were being ejected from  the stadium when Kazem said they became uncooperative and physically  resistant.  The officers refused to leave their seats.\"  Marjorie, that's  the one side of the story.  How do you respond?  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Well, when it -- when we're talking about issues of drunkenness  and disorderly conduct and the like, that, in and of itself, there's no  first amendment violation they are.  But if we're just talking about the  speech, whether or not they had a right to flip off to the players, et  cetera, essentially, the First Amendment says that all speech, all those  that don't fall into a particular exception, is essentially protected.  </p><p> They interfered with that speech with the arrest, and essentially you have  to then look at whether or not the limitation of that speech was justified  by the fact that they want a safe environment.  I don't think they're going  to be able to show that it fell into one of the five exceptions of speech  that is excluded from freedom of speech.  It's not inciting a riot, it's  not criminal, it's not criminal speech, it's not obscenity in terms of the  way that the law looks at obscenity.  It's not pornography or any one of  those things.  So, I think that they have a decent case here to say that  there's a First Amendment violation.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK, part of their complaint says this, \"The force used against the  plaintiffs was excessive, unreasonable, without cause and with deliberate  indifference to their health and safety.\"  You saw at one point, one of the  guys flips over one of the railings there.  Plaintiffs suffered bodily  injury, physical pain, emotional distress and deprivation of their  constitutional rights.  David, you know, in going through this pleading --  they also talked about the fact that one of the guys was taken into this  holding area, he was put into a body wrap for 30 to 40 minutes, completely  immobilizing him.  I mean, this think really ratcheted up quickly it sounds  like.  </p><p> BRUNO:  I think they have better claims about the injuries and the way that  they are treated by the police than the First Amendment.  Just getting back  to the First Amendment briefly, this is a private place, it's a private  stadium and the officer in that stadium used the word's code of conduct.   Code of conduct prevents these people from acting unruly.  So, security can  detain, they could take them out, they could ask you to leave, they are  allowed to do that.  </p><p> On the injuries, while police have to act reasonable, and I'm sure the  defense of the police officers is going to be -- well, they were resisting.   That's what they were initially charged with.  When somebody is resisting,  it's not a good scene, does not look good, I've seen it on video.  I did  not see this one particularly but that is going to be the perspective and  the defense from the police.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK.  I get a little crazy at college football games myself, never  arrested, though -- just for the record.  OK, to this other case now at the  theme park, I want to work through this.  The family attorney suing  Universal says, \"It's not a crazy request that you would have signs in  different languages, it's actually quite basic in this day age.\"  They  said, \"You're asking for international travelers, this is a mecca for  tourism -- talking about Central Florida -- this is a very basic thing that  should be thought up for the safety of patrons.\"  David?  </p><p> BRUNO:  Yes, I disagree that they legally have to do it.  Is it a good  idea?  Yes, I think it's a good idea.  But to file a lawsuit and claim that  this Orlando theme park was negligent in not posting a Spanish sign, I  disagree.  The fact of the matter is, 72 million visitors came to the  Orlando theme parks outside of the United States and they're from all  different languages.  It's not just a Spanish.  In addition, they had an  English warning and there were also pictures that went with that.  It's not  just Spanish.  Pictures probably were enough to give this guy notice.  But  you know what, he was going on the right anyway.  </p><p> BREAM:  Marjorie, I want to give the final word here on this case.  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Well, for me, it's simply an issue of whether or not they had a  duty of care.  What is a point of having a sign if everyone who is  attending this theme park can't read it or interact with it?  The fact of  the matter is, is that there are 41 million Spanish speakers in the United  States, there's over a million who come in from outside countries, mostly  predominantly Spanish-speaking countries.  It's not a one-off that a place  like Universal Studios or a theme park like this one would have a Spanish  sign in Spanish for these kinds of warnings, especially if it's a health  risk.  Safety is a safety issue for everyone, not just for the English  speakers and for -- in addressing this issue that they really should have  it in both languages.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Marjorie and David, thank you for making your  arguments.  We appreciate your time tonight.  We put it to the jury.  Let  us know what you think @FoxNewsNight or @ShannonBream, you'll weigh in.   Thanks, guys.  </p><p> MESIDOR:  Thank you.</p><p> BREAM:  And tonight, we end on a very somber note.  We would like to pay  tribute and say farewell to Bre Payton, she'd been a guest on our program,  she was a very close friend with our lead writer who is obviously, like so  many other people today, devastated by the news that this beautiful 26- year-old woman, brilliant and smart, suddenly passed away today in San  Diego.</p><p> Bre was a writer for The Federalist news site.  Her family, friends, and  colleagues are all shocked at her death.  We're told possibly H1N1 flu or  meningitis was involved.  A little bit early at this point, but our prayers  are with her and her friends and family.  They've set up a scholarship fund  that will go towards those supporting young, rising Christian leaders.  We  remember Bre tonight.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Digitale Geschaeftsmodelle werden immer mehr zum Kerngeschaeft der  klassischen Medienunternehmen, ob am Streaming-, Film- und TV-Markt  oder bei den grossen Social-Media- und Gaming-Plattformen. Auf der  MCB19 diskutieren wir mit den Protagonisten*innen der Branche, wie  hoch deren Einsaetze sein muessen, um am Markt bestehen zu koennen.\"</p><p>\"Es wird ernst im Kampf um Medienvielfalt\", so mabb-Direktorin  Anja Zimmer. \"Auf der MCB19 diskutieren wir darueber, wie wir weiter  in einer vielfaeltigen, demokratischen Gesellschaft leben koennen.  Dafuer braucht es zum Beispiel wirksame Mittel, um die  Meinungsfreiheit zu schuetzen und gegen Hassbotschaften vorzugehen. Es bedarf regulatorischer Mechanismen, um diskriminierungsfreien Zugang  und Auffindbarkeit von journalistischen Inhalten zu sichern. Und  schliesslich brauchen wir Foerderung fuer lokale Medieninhalte und  Journalisten, die lokale Nachrichten in laendlichen Raeumen  veroeffentlichen.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mediaconventionberlin.com\">www.mediaconventionberlin.com</url>        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/MediaConventionBerlin\">www.facebook.com/MediaConventionBerlin</url>        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/MCB_Berlin\">www.twitter.com/MCB_Berlin</url> #mcb19        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.instagram.com/mediaconventionberlin\">www.instagram.com/mediaconventionberlin</url>        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/mediaconventionberlin\">www.youtube.com/mediaconventionberlin</url></p><p>Wir danken unseren Partnern:</p><p>Mediengruppe RTL,\u00a0rbb, ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE,\u00a0WDR, ALEX TV,  FluxFM, Tagesspiegel,\u00a0buzzrank,\u00a0Blickpunkt Film, #DMW\u00a0Digital Media  Women, t3n digital pioneers, Gruenderszene, Berlin Valley, news  aktuell, Creative City Berlin, Die Weber</p><p>Ueber die MEDIA CONVENTION (MCB)</p><p>Die MEDIA CONVENTION Berlin (MCB) ist einer der fuehrenden  Medienkongresse in Europa.

The captains of the New Gilded Age \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2014 will appear together before Congress for the first time to justify their business practices. Members of the House judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee have investigated the internet giants for more than a year on accusations that they stifled rivals and harmed consumers.  The hearing is the government\u2019s most aggressive show against tech power since the pursuit to break up Microsoft two decades ago. It is set to be a bizarre spectacle, with four men who run companies worth a total of around $4.85 trillion \u2014 and who include two of the world\u2019s richest individuals \u2014 primed to argue that their businesses are not really that powerful after all.  And it will be a first in another way: Zuckerberg, Pichai, Bezos and Cook will all be testifying via videoconference, rather than rising side-by-side for a swearing-in at a witness table in Washington. Perhaps appropriately, their reckoning will be broadcast online.Read: \"It has the feeling of tech\u2019s Big Tobacco moment,\" said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the Federal Communications Commission and a fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s law school, referring to the 1994 congressional appearance of top executives of the seven largest U.S. tobacco companies, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive.  The hearing, which caps a 13-month investigation by the House subcommittee, will be closely watched for clues that could advance other antitrust cases against the companies. The Federal Trade Commission, for one, is preparing to depose Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives in its 13-month probe of the social network. The Justice Department may soon unveil a case against Google. And an investigation into Apple by state attorneys general also appears to be advancing.  As a result, preparations for the hearing have been frenetic \u2014 even with the event postponed by a few days this week to accommodate the commemoration of Rep. John Lewis \u2014 as tech lobbyists jockeyed behind the scenes to influence the types of questions that lawmakers might ask.  At the hearing, which starts at noon ET Wednesday, the 15 members of the antitrust subcommittee will have five minutes for each question. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the chairman of the subcommittee, will control the number of rounds of questioning, potentially stretching questioning into the evening.  The length of the hearing may also be prolonged since the antitrust issues facing Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon are complex and vastly different.  Amazon is accused of abusing its role as both a retailer and a platform hosting third-party sellers on its marketplace. Apple has been accused of unfairly using its clout over its App Store to block rivals and to force apps to pay high commissions. Rivals have said Facebook has a monopoly in social networking. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is dealing with multiple antitrust allegations because of Google\u2019s dominance in online advertising, search and smartphone software.  Democrats may also veer off the topic of antitrust and bring up concerns about misinformation on social media. Some Republicans are expected to sidetrack discussion with their concerns of liberal bias at the Silicon Valley companies and accusations that conservative voices are censored.  \"There was an attitude these were great American companies that created jobs and that we should have a hands-off approach and let them flourish,\" Cicilline said in an interview. \"But there are a lot of serious issues we have uncovered over the course of the investigation that weren\u2019t apparent when we first began investigating.\"  Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple declined to comment.  For the chief executives, the hearing will be a test of how they perform under fire. Bezos, 56, has not previously testified to Congress, while Cook, 59, and Pichai, 48, have both testified once before. Zuckerberg, 36, the youngest of the group, has the distinction of being the veteran: He has answered questions at three congressional hearings in the past two years as Facebook has dealt with issues such as election interference and privacy violations.  But none are taking any chances for the event to go awry. Zuckerberg, who had been at his 750-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has been preparing for his testimony with the law firm WilmerHale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. And a small team is working with Bezos for his testimony in Seattle, said people with knowledge of the matter.For weeks, the tech giants have also waged a lobbying battle to soften any blows. All four chief executives planned to call lawmakers on the House subcommittee in the days before the hearing, said three people with knowledge of the preparations who were not authorized to speak publicly.  Apple and Amazon also recently released studies to rebut claims of market dominance and anticompetitive practices. Last week, Apple publicized a study by a consulting firm called Analysis Group showing that the 30% commission it charges many apps for the right to appear on iPhones is close to what other platforms charge for distribution. The study left out that Apple helped popularize that 30% standard across the industry.  Amazon-funded economic consultants have in recent months argued that the e-commerce company\u2019s business model, which is not grounded in selling ads like Google and Facebook, makes it less likely to violate antitrust laws. Last week, Amazon also released a report on small business, saying sales by third-party sellers grew 26% in the past year, outpacing Amazon\u2019s own sales directly to consumers.  Google has said that the search and advertising tech markets that it dominates are changing fast. More than half of all searches for products on the internet originate on Amazon, Google\u2019s lobbyists have said.  And Facebook\u2019s Washington staff has pointed to competition from China, particularly from the popular video app TikTok, as evidence that competition in social media abounds. The Chinese-owned app is in the cross hairs of the Trump administration, which has threatened to ban it for national security reasons.  Big Tech\u2019s rivals have also jockeyed to have their gripes brought up at the hearing, even if for just a few minutes. The House subcommittee has been flooded with proposed questions, documents and letters from the companies\u2019 competitors, according to congressional staff and rivals.  Spotify, for instance, submitted questions about Apple\u2019s dominance of the App Store. GreatFire, a China-based group, sent a letter with nine questions for Cook about Apple\u2019s censorship of certain apps in China. Blix, a company whose email app competes with Apple and that is suing Apple in federal court for patent infringement, sent five questions to the subcommittee, including one on why Apple ranked its own apps ahead of rivals\u2019 offerings in its App Store.  This month, David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management tool, said he briefed lawmakers on a recent public spat with Apple. Apple had denied Basecamp\u2019s new email app from appearing in the App Store because it charged customers outside of Apple\u2019s payment system. After Heinemeier Hansson complained publicly, Apple permitted the app with some minor changes.  The subcommittee\u2019s members, who have already held five hearings about the tech giants, were informed and thoughtful during his briefing, Heinemeier Hansson said.  \"Clearly there\u2019s already a great resonance,\" he said.  Even if the hearing results in more theater than substance, some said the greatest risk to the tech companies was increasing momentum toward regulations.  \"The CEOs don\u2019t want to be testifying. Even having this collective hearing creates a sense of quasi-guilt just because of who else has gotten called in like this \u2014 Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Banks,\" said Paul Gallant, a tech policy analyst at the investment firm Cowen. \"That\u2019s not a crowd they want to be associated with.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42706291722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1951-F07F-805R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Deel 2: Wat merken gebruikers van de nieuwe privacywet? Deel 3: Hoe gaan de grote techbedrijven er mee om?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Het is volgens Facebook de grootste operatie in de geschiedenis van het bedrijf. ,,We hebben het grootste multidisciplinaire team in de Facebook-historie samengesteld om  Facebook helemaal klaar te krijgen voor de naleving van de AVG\", zegt Stephen Deadman, als wereldwijd vice-directeur privacy \u00e9\u00e9n van de hoofdverantwoordelijken bij Facebook.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Het enorme pakket nieuwe privacyregels dat op 25 mei in de gehele EU in werking treedt, voluit de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming, heeft grote gevolgen. Volgens  Deadman zijn er honderden mensen wereldwijd aan de slag om Facebook helemaal klaar te maken: ,,Het databeschermingsteam in Dublin is in een jaar 250 procent gegroeid, we hebben een nieuwe directeur privacy, een nieuwe <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">data protection officer</emphasis>. Van productontwikkeling tot marketing tot cybersecurity-specialisten tot  juristen: iedereen werkt mee.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">De mega-operatie bij Facebook is exemplarisch voor wat er nu gebeurt bij alle grote techbedrijven, waaronder ook Google, Amazon en Microsoft. In de AVG (ook wel bekend onder de Engelse afkorting GDPR) staat dat bedrijven veel transparanter moeten zijn over welke data ze verwerken en ze moeten het gebruikers bijvoorbeeld makkelijker maken om  persoonlijke data mee te nemen naar de concurrentie. </p><p>De verandering  met de meeste impact is het nieuwe boetebeleid. Vanaf eind mei kunnen boetes voor privacyschendingen oplopen tot  4 procent van de wereldwijde jaaromzet. Voor Facebook kan dat oplopen tot zo'n 1,3 miljard euro, voor   Google zelfs 3,5 miljard. Alle zeilen worden bijgezet voor goede naleving.</p><h> Stok om 'Big Tech' mee te slaan</h><p>De AVG wordt door velen gezien als juridische stok van de EU om 'Big Tech' mee te slaan. Facebook stond door zijn monopolie op sociale media al volop in de schijnwerpers van Europese regulerende instanties, en dat spotlight is er alleen maar feller op geworden sinds het dataschandaal rondom Cambridge Analytica. Daarbij werden gegevens van maximaal  87 miljoen Facebookgebruikers misbruikt voor het op maat maken van politieke campagnes voor Trump en vermoedelijk ook de Brexit. </p><p>Facebook moet koste wat kost herhaling voorkomen. ,,We moeten je data beschermen. Als ons dat niet lukt, verdienen we je data niet\", schreef Mark Zuckerberg in een grote excuus-advertentie vlak na het dataschandaal. Met de AVG draait het voor Facebook niet alleen meer om het vertrouwen van gebruikers maar ook om het overtuigen van de handhavers van de EU.

Deel 2: Wat merken gebruikers van de nieuwe privacywet? Deel 3: Hoe gaan de grote techbedrijven er mee om?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Het is volgens Facebook de grootste operatie in de geschiedenis van het bedrijf. ,,We hebben het grootste multidisciplinaire team in de Facebook-historie samengesteld om  Facebook helemaal klaar te krijgen voor de naleving van de AVG\", zegt Stephen Deadman, als wereldwijd vice-directeur privacy \u00e9\u00e9n van de hoofdverantwoordelijken bij Facebook.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Het enorme pakket nieuwe privacyregels dat op 25 mei in de gehele EU in werking treedt, voluit de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming, heeft grote gevolgen. Volgens  Deadman zijn er honderden mensen wereldwijd aan de slag om Facebook helemaal klaar te maken: ,,Het databeschermingsteam in Dublin is in een jaar 250 procent gegroeid, we hebben een nieuwe directeur privacy, een nieuwe <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">data protection officer</emphasis>. Van productontwikkeling tot marketing tot cybersecurity-specialisten tot  juristen: iedereen werkt mee.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">De mega-operatie bij Facebook is exemplarisch voor wat er nu gebeurt bij alle grote techbedrijven, waaronder ook Google, Amazon en Microsoft. In de AVG (ook wel bekend onder de Engelse afkorting GDPR) staat dat bedrijven veel transparanter moeten zijn over welke data ze verwerken en ze moeten het gebruikers bijvoorbeeld makkelijker maken om  persoonlijke data mee te nemen naar de concurrentie. </p><p>De verandering  met de meeste impact is het nieuwe boetebeleid. Vanaf eind mei kunnen boetes voor privacyschendingen oplopen tot  4 procent van de wereldwijde jaaromzet. Voor Facebook kan dat oplopen tot zo'n 1,3 miljard euro, voor   Google zelfs 3,5 miljard. Alle zeilen worden bijgezet voor goede naleving.</p><h> Stok om 'Big Tech' mee te slaan</h><p>De AVG wordt door velen gezien als juridische stok van de EU om 'Big Tech' mee te slaan. Facebook stond door zijn monopolie op sociale media al volop in de schijnwerpers van Europese regulerende instanties, en dat spotlight is er alleen maar feller op geworden sinds het dataschandaal rondom Cambridge Analytica. Daarbij werden gegevens van maximaal  87 miljoen Facebookgebruikers misbruikt voor het op maat maken van politieke campagnes voor Trump en vermoedelijk ook de Brexit. </p><p>Facebook moet koste wat kost herhaling voorkomen. ,,We moeten je data beschermen. Als ons dat niet lukt, verdienen we je data niet\", schreef Mark Zuckerberg in een grote excuus-advertentie vlak na het dataschandaal. Met de AVG draait het voor Facebook niet alleen meer om het vertrouwen van gebruikers maar ook om het overtuigen van de handhavers van de EU. Facebook zal onder het nieuwe regime vooral te maken krijgen met de Ierse privacytoezichthouder, aangezien Facebooks internationale hoofdkantoor in Ierland staat.</p><p> Donderdag ontdekte persbureau <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reuters</emphasis> dat Facebook  zijn voorwaarden voor de 1,5 miljard gebruikers buiten Europa, de VS en Canada heeft aangepast, zodat zij n\u00edet onder de AVG vallen - terwijl dat eerst wel zo zou zijn. Bij zijn hoorzitting in de Amerikaanse Senaat eerder deze maand suggereerde Zuckerberg nog dat de 'geest' van de  AVG het uitgangspunt zou zijn voor Facebooks wereldwijde privacy-beleid.

View original post here[2]. Via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,[3] Bulls Make A Charge For The Highs Last week,[4]we discussed how the market managed to clear the'Maginot Line'which brings January highs into focus. The chart below is the updated analysis from last week.  Given this is a'weekly'chart, it takes much more time for signals to register. The advance over the last few weeks has taken the market back into overbought territory and was apoint made last week: 'The market can most assuredly get even more overbought from current levels, but does suggest that upside is becoming more limited from current levels.However, with the weekly 'buy signal'triggered this past week, we must give the bulls some room to run.' </p><p> Currently, the'bulls'remain clearly in charge of the marketfor now. While it seems as if much of the 'tariff talk' has been priced into stocks, what likely hasn't as of yet is rising evidence of weakening economic data(ISM, employment, etc.), weakening consumer demand, and the impact of higher rates. While on an intermediate-term basis these macro issues will matter, it is primarily just sentiment that matters in the short-term. From that perspective,the market retested the previous breakout above the March highs last week(the Maginot line)<url normalizedValue=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/bulls-clash-at-the-line-07-20-18/which\">https://realinvestmentadvice.com/bulls-clash-at-the-line-07-20-18/which</url> keepsPathway #1intact. It also suggests that next week will likely see a test of the January highs.  With moving averages rising, this shifts Pathway #2a and #2b further out into the August and September time frames.The potential for a correction back to support before a second attempt at all-time highs would align with normal seasonal weakness heading into the Fall. Currently, there is a very low risk of a deeper correction(Pathway #3).However, it is a possibility that should not be ignored at this juncture.With the administration gearing up for further tariffs against China, and China retaliating in kind, at a time when the Fed is already more aggressively tightening monetary policy, it would be remiss to ignore the risk of'something going wrong.' It would also be remiss to not remind you that despite the'bullish short-term view,'the long-term outlook remains decidedly bearish. With valuations elevated, price extended, and deviations near historic records, the potential for a more severe correction in prices is an absolute certainty.  The issue is that these cycles can remain both fundamentally and technically overvalued for longer than logic would dictate particularly when there are artificial influences at play.However, the message is clear for those that choose to listen.This is why it is crucially important to have a discipline and strategy in place which will manage the exposure to risk when things change in the market. Weekly Buy Signal Is In, But Don't Jump In the 401k Plan Manager at the bottom of this newsletter each week, I publish the model that drives our portfolio allocations over time.  There are two important concepts to understand about this model. Risk knows no age:Risk doesn't care how old you are. It is often said that if you are 20, you should take on a lot of portfolio risk. However, if that risk is taken at the top of a market cycle, the damage to the long-term financial goals can be disastrous. We believe that our allocation to risk has nothing to do with our age, and everything to do with the potential for the loss of capital. Therefore, our allocation model is broken into two parts. Allocation model is based upon current valuation levels. If valuations were 10-12x earnings the target allocation levels would be primarily weighted towards equity (i.e. 80% Stocks / 20% Bonds)  As valuations rise behind historical extremes, target equity levels are reduced. (i.e. 60/40, 50/50, etc.)  The EQUITY portion of the allocation is also adjusted based on current market risk.Earlier this year, the equity risk portion of the allocation model was reduced from 100% to 75% due to a triggering of a confirmed 'sell' signal. There are 4-primary indicators to the model: 1st signal-short-term warning signal. Only an alert to pay attention to portfolio risk.  2nd signal-reduce equity by 25%.  3rd signal-(Moving average cross-over)reduce equity by another 25%.  4th signal-(Trend change) - reduce equity by another 25% and short the market.   The 4-signals above also run in reverse. So, when a signal reverses itself, equity risk is increased in the model as is the case this week. With that signal in place, we must now increase our portfolio allocation model to 100% of target. However, it is important to note these signals are based on'weekly'data and are intermediate-term in nature.Therefore, by the time these longer-term indicators are triggered, the very short-term conditions of the market are generally either very overbought, or oversold. So, Do I Buy Or Not? At this juncture, most individuals tend to let their emotions get the better of them and they make critical errors with their portfolios. Emotional buying and selling almost always leads you into doing exactly the opposite of what you should do. Currently, the market has registered a'buy signal,'which means we need to be following our checklist to ensure we are making sound investment decisions: What is the allocation model going to look like between asset classes?  How will those choices affect the volatility of my portfolio relative to the market?  What is the inherent risk of being wrong with my choices?  What is my exit point to sell as the market goes up?  Where is my exit point to sell if the market goes down?  What specific investments will I use to fill each piece of my allocation model?  How does each of those investments affect the portfolio as a whole as well as each other?  Where is my greatest and least amount of exposure in my portfolio?  Have I properly hedged my risk in my portfolio in case of a catastrophic event?  If you can't answer the majority of these questions - you should not be putting your money in the market. These are the questions that we ask ourselves every day with our portfolio allocation structures and you should be doing the same. This is basic portfolio management. Investing without understanding the risk and implications is like driving with your eyes closed. You may be fine for a while but you are going to get seriously hurt somewhere along the way. There isNO RULEwhich states you have to jump into the market with both feet today. This is not a competition or game that you are trying to beat. Who cares if your neighbor made 1% more than you last year. Comparison is the one thing that will lead you to take far more risk in your portfolio than you realize.While you will love the portfolio as it rises with the market; you will rue the day when the market declines. Being a'contrarian'investor, and going against the grain of the mainstream media, feels like an abomination of nature. However, being a successful investor requires a strict diet of discipline and patience combined with proper planning and execution. Emotions have no place within your investment program and need to be checked at the door. Unfortunately, being emotionless about your money is a very difficult thing for most investors to accomplish. As humans, we tend to extrapolate the success or failure within our portfolios as success and failure of ourselves as individuals. This is patently wrong.As investors, we will lose more often than we would like - the difference is limiting the losses and maximizing the winnings.This explains why there are so few really successful investors in the world. With this in mind, it doesn't mean that you can't do well as an investor. It just means that you must pay attention to the'risks'inherent in the market and act accordingly. \u2022 Yes, the market is on a 'buy' signal. \u2022 Yes, we need to add exposure as shown in the 401k plan manager below. \u2022 No, it doesn't mean that you need to act immediately However, it does mean that we need to pay close attention to developments over the next couple of weeks to be sure the'intersection'is clear and that we can proceed to the next traffic light safely. Hopefully, we can catch it'green'- if not, we will obey the signal, stop, and wait for our turn once again. While the model is being increased back to 100% of target, we will selectively add equity exposure during short-term corrective actions in the market. As I noted last week: 'With our portfolios nearly fully allocated, there are not a lot of actions we need to take currently as the markets continue to trend higher for now.We will continue to monitor our exposure and hedge risk accordingly, but with the weekly 'buy signal' registered, we are keeping our hedges limited and are widening our stops just a bit.  As noted above, a short-term correction is needed before adding further equity exposure to portfolios.That correction likely started on Friday, and I will not be surprised to see it continue into next week. A retest of 2800 is likely at this point, which would keep Pathway #1 intact. However, a violation of that level will likely trigger a short-term sell signal, which could push the market back towards previous support at 2740.  There is a lot of support forming at 2740, which should be supportive of the market over the next couple of months. A violation of that level suggests something has likely broken and more protective actions should be taken.'  Until that happens, we will give the markets the benefit of the doubtfor now. All FAANG'ed Up Doug Kass had an interesting point on Apple's surge to $1 Trillion in market cap. A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration - in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits - is real and may be long-lasting. 'The number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,' said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon'Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.'-New York Times,Apple's $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies[5]  With much justification, a small group of stocks, referred to as FAANG, has dominated the U.S. stock market and U.S. economy. Nearly half of this year's gains in the S...00 Index have come from the five component stocks of FAANG (Facebook (FB) , Amazon (AMZN) , Apple (AAPL) , Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet \u2014 aka Google (GOOGL) ). Lance here:  A couple of week's ago I addressed this market capitalization issue,to wit:[6]  'The current environment has the look and feel of a late-stage market cycle. This is particularly the case when you have 20-stocks making up more of the overall S...00 index than the bottom 400 combined.'   'Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue-chip names.'-Bob Farrell's Rule #7[7]:  Back to Doug: Indeed, FAANG stocks have fueled much of the near-decade-long bull market since March 2009. The rise of FAANG has contributed and influenced our domestic economy, in a not-so-good way. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's unfettered growth has manifested in declining levels of unionization and contributed to the disruption of numerous industries, thus influencing the general trend of weak wage growth and impacting the rise in income inequality. As the technology of FAANG has rapidly eclipsed the influence of regulatory supervision and an antiquated antitrust legislation, their sales growth and market dominance have gone nearly untouched by the hand of government. The business media has rejoiced in Apple reaching a $1-trillion market cap and, not surprisingly, has embarked on a trivial, simplistic and superficial discourse, questioning how much further Apple can rise, which will be the next $1-trillion company, and so forth. Rather, one should consider the consequences of the concentrative issues relating to FAANG and consider what happened to the U.S. and global economies when our banking industry grew exponentially by leveraging itself into oblivion, proving that it was not too big to fail in 2008-2009. 'A year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable; today, they seem not to be.' -Luigi Zingales, University of Chicago  To me, the existential risk to FAANG is that their growth is dulled by the above realities and the U.S. government takes a more aggressive position toward FAANG's domination. After all, in an age of populism seen both on the political left and the right, assaults by legislators and government regulatory bodies seem likely to intensify. As well, should the current phase of protectionism continue and the possibility of trade wars intensify even further, it could result in the disruptors being disrupted. After all, nearly 19% of Apple's sales are derived from China.  By contrast, the existential risk to our economy is that their growth is allowed to continue at a helter-skelter pace, with some of the downside factors mentioned in this morning's missive multiplying should the growth snowball be permitted to roll further down the economic hill. ******* Doug's point is interesting as it dovetails into an article thatDavid Robertson, CFA wrote for RIA[8]this past week wherein he noted: 'Such competition moves the tradeoffs of centralization vs. decentralization to the geopolitical stage: 'The AI competition may be better viewed as part of a broader struggle between a decentralised democratic model and a digital authoritarian system.'  So are technology companies breaking bad?That would probably be an overstatement, but it is very fair to say that many of the elements crucial to harness the full potential technological innovation are underrepresented in today's environment. Knowledge of technologies is insufficient, governance is slow and weak, and public engagement is low. This creates a weak position from which to wrest power from companies with strong economic incentives. This is important for investors. Unless things change, there is a good chance that not only will the great potential of technological innovation fail to be realized, but also that such innovations will continue to be exploited right up until things break.'  The risk of concentration into the few stocks poses an enormous risk to investors when, not if, something inevitably goes wrong. As we saw just recently with plunges in $FB and $NFLX, given the massive levels of leverage currently built into the system a concentrated sell-off in the FAANG stocks could lead to a rather disastrous unwinding for investors. While such an event is widely dismissed as impossible, it is important to remember it was deemed to be that way previously. This tweet from David Rosenberg sums it up succinctly. Big and bigger. As Apple becomes the first to join the trillion-dollar club, Nasdaq's market cap-to-GDP ratio is now rapidly approaching the bubble peak during the dotcom era. pic.twitter.com/U0Z0X6NmHj[9]  \u2014 David Rosenberg (@EconguyRosie) August 2, 2018[10]   As I noted last week, the underlying economic environment, and the associated structural deformations pose a substantial risk to investors longer-term.  'While fighting trade wars, pushing tax cuts and increasing government spending may provide short-term boosts to the economy by pulling forward future consumption - they do not address the issues which are detracting from longer-term growth.'  Debt  Spending Hikes  Demographics  Surging health care costs  Structural employment shifts  Technological innovations  Globalization  Financialization  While Doug's, David's and Rosie's points are valid, these are issues that will take time to develop. As such, the ongoing performance of FAANG stocks will continue to lure unwitting investors into the trap which will eventually lead to their demise. But such is the nature of markets historically.

Sir, the floor is yours. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Steve Calk</emphasis> (IR): <br/> Thank you, Operator. <br/>By now, you should have received a copy of the Company's first-quarter 2016 earnings release. If you have not, please call FTI Consultingat 212-850-5721. O <br/>n the call today we have <person><nameText>Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; </nameText></person>Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of LoyaltyOne. <br/>Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call, and some of the responses to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. <br/>Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call. <br/>Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com. <br/>With that, I would like to turn the call over to <person><nameText>Ed Heffernan. </nameText></person>Ed? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Thanks, Steve. With me today, as mentioned, is Charles Horn, our CFO; and Bryan Pearson, Head of our LoyaltyOne business. That includes both the AIR MILES business in Canada, as well as the BrandLoyalty business headquartered out of the Netherlands. <br/>Charles will update you on the quarterly results, then Bryan will give you some color into the various businesses at LoyaltyOne, and I will wrap it up with the scorecard for Q1 results, as well as my outlook for the full-year 2016. Based on past comments, we are going to move with pace so we can have more time for questions at the end. <br/>Take it away, Charles. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Thanks, Ed. <br/>Turning to slide 2, we will talk about the first-quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5%, to $1.68 billion, and core EPS up 5%, to $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign-exchange rates, reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized, and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016. <br/>Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2, and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. Now, why do we believe this? <br/>Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there were several reasons. <br/>First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. <br/>Second, loss rates are expected to drift downward from first-quarter highs. <br/>Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember, in the first quarter of 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant-currency basis. <br/>Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record CRM backlog for second-half delivery. <br/>During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $414 million. The buy-back program remains our top capital allocation priority, and we expect it will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3 times. <br/>With that, let's go to the next slide, and Bryan will walk you through the LoyaltyOne results.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bryan Pearson</emphasis> (President and CEO of LoyaltyOne): <br/> Thanks, Charles. <br/>LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter, as revenue decreased 2%, to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, to $85 million, on a constant-currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES, our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant-currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost control. As expected, at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant-currency basis, due to program timing differences. <br/>Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant-currency basis, due to higher-margin programs that were driving a 300-basis-points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins. AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5%, or 57 million miles, over the same quarter from last year. <br/>Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical, as we continue to convert Vimeo MasterCard  holders to the premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer. <br/>This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that is the result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia. Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth for the second quarter, due to reduced promotional activity and the one-time conversion of the [Sobe's] Legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated. As we've stated previously, quarterly results can vary based upon the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full-year issuance growth of mid-single digits. <br/>AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with our AIR MILES cash program -- that instant reward option -- driving approximately half of the increase, as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment. For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. For the year, we anticipate full-year constant-currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range, as well. <br/>Now, turning to BrandLoyalty, we anticipate a very strong second quarter, whereby revenue could be up as much is 50% on a constant-currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada, with six promotions that have been planned for 2016. And this represents a significant increase in sales over last year. In addition, we launched our first pilot, in the US, late in the first quarter. <br/>We are pleased with the results to date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full-year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as compared to 2015, on a constant-currency basis. <br/>Lastly, let me update you on dotz and Precima. Starting with dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro, with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner. Cencosud is the third-largest grocer in Brazil, and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrison's -- one of the UK's top-four grocers -- where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrison's more effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach. <br/>In closing, LoyaltyOne achieved solid first-quarter results, with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter, and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne. Awesome job, everyone. <br/>I guess it's back to you, Charles. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Thanks, Bryan. <br/>Let's turn to slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2%, to $493 million, and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22%, to $81 million, for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed, as three-fourths of the business -- digital and technology platforms -- grew a robust 8% during the quarter, while the remaining one-fourth -- agency -- underperformed, where the revenue declined by 23% versus the first quarter of 2015. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs, stacking levels increased in anticipation of revenue that has yet to occur. <br/><br/>Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We felt that the old formats where we used to talk about database and data, and so forth, really is not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically, as the broad portfolio of offline/online services Epsilon delivers are packaged or bundled omni-channel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to give it to you in that format. So what we've done is, we've put it together where we're going to highlight two categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. <br/>The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and/or technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate the usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through a loyalty program, within an e-mail communication, or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices. <br/>The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consists of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector. Both media services deliver to agencies on behalf of their clients, as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients. <br/>Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year over year, or about 8%, mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 15 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30 all of last year. <br/>The 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach , and Sears , and is a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients, along with others, such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining anonymized first-party with third-party data and 80 billion daily online interactions, to develop a persistent consumer ID. <br/>Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon's traditional agency business, we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG, and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business at Conversant, which is the non-data-driven traditional display business, was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs. <br/>We don't know if this bubble is a bubble within agency or more structural, and needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we will have to be more aggressive on going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although we will likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process, which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships. <br/>Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by a 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision build. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance. <br/>Focusing on the key drivers for our growth, credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to build customer loyalty for both our longstanding and newest brand partners, as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us for four years or more, continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. <br/>Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter, by leveraging our large understanding of our brands, along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear. <br/>Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members who have been engaged with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured card members with a proven spending and payment history, and they're demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our longstanding partners. It is also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners. <br/><br/>Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17%, driven by the strong AR growth. Importantly, we realized strong operating expense leverage, as we are able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. As expected, gross yields experienced some compression, driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files, and lower late fees, as we have seen several declines for several months in our first-stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items. <br/>Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses, delinquency levels, and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew two card (inaudible) renewal at year end. The related receivables, net of the allowance for loan loss, have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables, and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss. <br/>Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter, with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year, in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships. <br/>With that, I'll turn it over to Ed. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Great. Thanks, guys. Why don't we turn to first-quarter scorecard? <br/>And the goal, of course, is to have more green than yellows and reds. And right now, we are tracking with [the majority] being green. I would say, in terms of Q1, a couple of general comments. One is, as Charles mentioned, this was, obviously, our toughest quarter, and comp versus last year was very difficult. And, putting in a plus five top, plus five earnings was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it is good to get that behind us. <br/>Also, you will find that it was a mixed bag, in terms of what had got us from A to B. But, at the end, the pluses outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be. As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. <br/>We have good line of sight into the rest of the year. From a first-quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said, in terms of guidance, at about $1.7 billion top, at about $3.84 on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side with about $26 million in top, at about $0.05 on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half. <br/>We talked about the toughest comp of year is now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap. So, overall, consolidated, we got where we wanted to be, and remain on track for the year. And Card Services -- just the highlights, of course -- the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then, obviously, due to the fact that we are growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves, and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, that did grow 9%. <br/>Yield gets the yellow. It was little over 200 basis points, due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it is already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year. And we have pretty good visibility into that, as well -- so, more of a Q1 issue. The loss rate, we spent the first three months of the year here dealing with two questions that people were spooked about, the first being credit quality and the second being Canada going into a depression. <br/>And what's interesting is, those are the two items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. <br/><br/>We now expect it to drift downwards, as the year progresses, from a seasonally high Q1. And, similar to what we said three months ago, we will say the same thing now, we check with all our collectors and everyone else. There is zero pressure that we are seeing coming in that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So, we're just not seeing it, we did not see it before. And again, we are just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we are tracking nicely to that. <br/>I will emphasize the next point, which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth, and are you growing too fast, too slowly? How are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality, and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it is 32% -- and that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And, in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailer is growing 2%, 3%, we are growing 10%. <br/>And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point, to me, really brings it home, that 80% of this tender share gain, they are coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they've passed the peak loss point and they are very mature, and our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it is all about. And that's the data-driven targeted marketing. <br/>And I think that's probably the most important takeaway, is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that. It is coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So, that continues to work out well. <br/>The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, have not been released, and they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So, the pipeline looks good. <br/>And, as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into -- probably, if you were to ask me about where the concern is for the year, it is certainly not on the credit side, it is certainly not on the Canadian side, it is certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon and Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about one-quarter of Epsilon and Conversant. And what we saw there was a general pullback in a number of the verticals, and we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said. <br/>We don't know whether that's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter, given the turmoil, or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. But we don't know right now, and we are not going to knee-jerk it at this point. <br/>On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's three-quarters of Epsilon and Conversant, and we continue to see very, very strong take-up, in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant. <br/>The number of wins that we are seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year. And then, from an expense perspective and flexibility perspective, our India office is up and running, and we are hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses. And that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year. <br/>LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had, frankly, a little bit better Q1, from the EBITDA perspective, than we had initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2 this year, it will be more of the reverse, where you will have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it is all driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar. Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well, and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the US, actually, we are beginning to make some nice inroads there, as well. So good news on that front. <br/><br/>Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was that issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance was very strong, and specifically issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before, actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking, and doing quite well. Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4%, plus 11%, frankly, on a constant-currency basis, was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. <br/>Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it is a typical ADS quarter. You have got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected, you had some things that went worse than expected, and the end result is they even out, and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward, as well. If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses were little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track. <br/>We talked about agency and media was weak. That was offset by the fact, in LoyaltyOne, that AIR MILES was better, while BrandLoyalty was tracking. So, again, with us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want, but at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses hopefully even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full-year guidance, that's exactly what we are saying. It is very straightforward. <br/>Now, with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence in how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full-year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10%, and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind this. We're going to ramp up to high-single digits in the second quarter, and then we will do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump-off into 2017. <br/>Visibility is quite strong. Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8%, and earnings also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration. From a Card Services perspective, you will see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And, lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect, for the year, Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net of funding. <br/>Yield compression, which I'm sure we will get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest compression, which is how we want to take it into 2017. And then we said the pipeline is very robust, and that will get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain a 20% plus growth rate in the file. And that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas, and we don't renew certain folks. <br/>So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are three-quarters of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high-single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall, last year, was about 30 wins and a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus, once they fully spooled up. We expect at least that this year, if not a little bit better, which would be great. <br/>And then the agency stuff, look, we are going to watch it, and we are going to see it is a people intensive business. It is at about one-quarter of Epsilon and Conversant. From what we are seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it is lessening, in terms of the softness, as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year. <br/><br/>Okay, last slide, full year, LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect a very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then, in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there -- it is how we get paid -- is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive, on a constant-currency basis, low-single-digit revs and EBITDA full year, which again would fly in the face of the weakening consumer in Canada. Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We're seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those two data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. <br/>I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for 2016 and 2017, as losses normalize, and with the huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses. What you're essentially doing is, you're knocking that growth rate down a bit, but you are still looking at low end double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year, we are looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes [some drag] from FX. <br/>And then, in 2018, if in fact we are right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model, and you'd have a re-acceleration in growth rates. So, if you look at long term for the Company, you are looking somewhere mid-teens to high teens, revs and core EPS. Then, when you are in a period of normalization and building reserves, you are probably looking at low end, top and bottom, double digit, and then you snap back mid-teens when that normalizes. <br/>So, overall, not too shabby of a model. You will also find with us that we tend to have different levers and different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But, overall, the model holds together quite nicely. For guidance, on the last slide, we're keeping it the same. And we are not going to spend a lot of time going through the [nits and nats] of how we get there, but it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3 times GDP target. <br/>We looked at cash flow, looks very nice, very strong this year, at about $1.4 billion. Look, when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we will adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. <br/>But, again, we are not going to be tweaking everything every quarter. We are going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis. <br/>So, that's all I had. Why don't we open it up for Q&amp;A? Operator? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> (Operator Instructions) <br/>Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW . <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sanjay Sakhrani</emphasis> (Analyst - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc): <br/> My first question is on the agency side of Epsilon. Charles, you mentioned that you are not sure if it is structural or not, in terms of the weakness there. And maybe Ed or Charles, you could talk about it a little bit more. <br/>Is that weakness specific to Epsilon? Or are others seeing similar weakness? Obviously adjusting for maybe one or two large clients that have unique issues? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> It is a good question. Don't know enough yet at this point. We do know -- I can only say what happened in our business, which was, across a number of our verticals, CPG and Telco and retail, it was interesting, we also have pulled back in Q1. It looks like it is beginning to trickle back in, as we start moving into Q2, but it still little bit soft. <br/>So we don't want to call it yet, but it seemed like a lot of people just stepped on the brakes in Q1. So I just don't know what the others are seeing out there right now, Sanjay. But from us, it looks like Q1, people just pulled back. And then as we're looking at Q2, it looks like it is beginning to loosen up a little bit. And so if it continues to loosen up, we are not going to need to take any action. If it continues to stay soft like this, we are going to have to take some internal actions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sanjay Sakhrani</emphasis> (Analyst - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc): <br/> And I assume you are assuming continued softness for the rest of year in your guidance? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> We are assuming, for the three-quarters of Epsilon and Conversant that's the tech and digital and everything else, we assume they're going to continue to be quite strong at about plus 8. And then on the agency side, to your point, we are assuming in our guidance that it will be soft, but not nearly as soft as Q1. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sanjay Sakhrani</emphasis> (Analyst - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc): <br/> Got it. And than just second question, my final question. Just on those two portfolios that you chose -- or that are not renewing in card, could you just talk about how that unfolded? Why? And how tenured were those relationships? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes, this gets. It is a good question, and we are at the point now where we've got the business growing, the files growing 25% a year, which is pretty much -- we don't want to drift much higher than that. But we are also finding that the pipeline -- the number of opportunities that are out there, as people shift their dollars to the data-driven targeted spend, frankly, there's a whole bunch of business out there. And there are times in the past where we've had some clients who have decided not to pour all their energy and efforts into driving tender share growth and card growth. <br/>That usually comes with a change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we've just said, that's fine, we will go with the flow. Right now, we are dealing with, how do we allocate our capital? And if we want to continue to grow the business, the file 20% plus of the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect? And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon -- how do we say it -- the comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it did not look like the best use of our capital. <br/>And so we have reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are -- I think more down the fairway for us. So it is a nice -- I'm trying to be a polite way of saying, there is going to be some times where the capital is better used elsewhere, and this is one of those times. We've just never been capital constrained, but we are at the point now where the growth rate in the file is pretty much at our max level. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sanjay Sakhrani</emphasis> (Analyst - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc): <br/> And how does it affect the growth assumption for that business? Does it? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> It doesn't affect -- no, there's no effect at all. It's already been spoken for. And I know we had some -- already some questions about whether it was -- which client it was. And obviously, we haven't negotiated anything in terms of where we are going to put the file. But it is just FYI, it is not any client on the left coast. So that's all I can say on that one. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sanjay Sakhrani</emphasis> (Analyst - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc): <br/> Okay, great. Thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Darrin Peller with Barclays. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darrin Peller</emphasis> (Analyst - Barclays Capital): <br/> Thanks, guys. Let me just quickly follow-up on the Epsilon side. If you can give us a little more granularity, first into the strength of the tech and data side there? And I know Conversant, in the pipeline, looks strong still. But -- I guess I just want to make sure that's sustainable, in terms of, you're not seeing any of the same clients on the agency side pull back at all on the tech side. Obviously, the growth doesn't show that yet. <br/>And then if you can give us a little more color on the levers that you have capable of pulling, from a cost standpoint, at Epsilon? And if it has to start next quarter, I guess how much room do we have? It just feels like an area that you've tried to cut costs in the past, and outsourced things to India, et cetera. So I'd love to just hear more color on how much room there is.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes, right now, what we are seeing is the continuation of strong demand for the digital products at Conversant, specifically the SKU level, data driven targeted display offerings. Very strong. In general, the more core Epsilon, big loyalty and customer database builds are strong, and data offerings are strong. So all the heavy tech stuff demand continues to be strong. We expect that to continue for the rest of year. <br/>On the agency side, look, we need to be very careful we don't knee-jerk this thing. If it is an air pocket, then great, and we are back in business. If it looks like it is softer than we expect, then it is a very project-intensive, people-intensive business. You would have to move quickly to make sure that revenues and expenses sync up. But what we're seeing right now is, the softness in Q1 is already lessening a bit as we move into Q2. So we're going to hold off knee-jerking this thing. <br/>And if, in fact, Q2 comes in very soft on the agency side, we will still make our [nums] for the Company, from a guidance perspective, for sure. But we will have to take some expenses out, to make sure we make our nums for the year. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darrin Peller</emphasis> (Analyst - Barclays Capital): <br/> Maybe I just missed it. But in terms of the 5%, what was your overall Epsilon outlook for the year now, in terms of organic growth, for the whole segment? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> What we talked about for Epsilon is mid-single-digit plus on top and bottom. I think we'll stay there. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darrin Peller</emphasis> (Analyst - Barclays Capital): <br/> You're staying there now, okay. All right. Thanks. Let me just shift, and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the private label, on the card services side. I guess first on growth, do you agree -- co-branding, I know, is tougher now from a competitive standpoint. So just revisiting the addressable market, in terms of opportunities, obviously, given your divesting, I think this is the first time I remember hearing you guys divesting a couple of portfolios, based on better opportunities for probably more profitability elsewhere. <br/>But either way, I guess just revisiting the addressable market would be helpful, given it seems like it is more private label focused than co-branding now. And then on that note, the yield compression is a combination of things, like you guys mentioned automated payments and new vintages, but also co-branding. With all of those things anniversarying and co-branding potentially moving lower now as a percentage of the mix, should the yield potentially rise in 2017? Or at least be stable? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> I think the yield will be relatively stable in 2017, exactly to your point. As we are burning through these compression issues and the (technical difficulty) anniversary, and to your point exactly, a little less emphasis on the co-brand side, you won't have that large compression that you've seen the last couple of years of 100 basis points or so on the yield side. [It will be] significantly less than that. <br/>And that has to do, again, with, we are looking to optimize the portfolio, which means that at this part of the cycle, you've got an awful lot of mouths to feed when it comes to co-brand. So that isn't quite as exciting to us at this point in the cycle. We've seen this play out before. So we are looking to optimize the files, continue the growth at 20% plus, and keep the compression much more modest on a go-forward basis. And based on the pipeline and what we are signing and what you will see released later this year, we feel pretty good with it. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darrin Peller</emphasis> (Analyst - Barclays Capital): <br/> All right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Does that complete your question? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darrin Peller</emphasis> (Analyst - Barclays Capital): <br/> Yes. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin McVeigh</emphasis> (Analyst - Macquarie Research): <br/> Great, thanks. Nice job, guys. In terms of -- Charles, the improvement in credit to 10 bps, what drove that? And how should we think about that over the course of the year? Still sticking with the [5.5%]? Or should we expect some improvement there, as well? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> What we gave guidance to is a [5.0] loss rate for the year. (multiple speakers) We came in a little bit better in Q1. I think you will see we could come in a little bit better in Q2 and Q3, could be up a little bit in Q4 compared to original guidance. But I would say we are right on track to hit the 5% for the year. In terms of [missing] -- doing better by 10 bps of the first quarter, some of its timing. But I would say for the year, we're tracking right to the [5.0] loss rate that we gave as guidance.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin McVeigh</emphasis> (Analyst - Macquarie Research): <br/> Got it. And then as we think about the mix of private label versus co-brand, going forward, we are still in the range we talked about historically? Or more of a shift on the private-label side? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> I would say we're still around 80/20, 80% private label, 20% co-brand. To Ed's point before, we're doing less co-brand. That's where most of the competition is, so we're focused more on private label. You know us. Private label is our secret sauce. That's where we have all the expertise. And so you will see more growth coming there, which, long-term, should benefit the yields, going back to Darrin's question before. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin McVeigh</emphasis> (Analyst - Macquarie Research): <br/> Awesome. Thanks. I will get back in queue. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Bob Napoli with William Blair. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bob Napoli</emphasis> (Analyst - William Blair &amp; Company): <br/> Thank you, good morning. Hey, Ed and Charles, are the additional buybacks in your guidance? You bought back about 400 million. You said you had 500 million, and I think you expect to buy back closer to 800 million to 1 billion? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> So the second piece of our authorization is not considered, Bob. So the initial 500 million was considered. The second 500 million is not considered in guidance. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bob Napoli</emphasis> (Analyst - William Blair &amp; Company): <br/> Okay. Thank you. Then on the tender share improvement, the 80% from mature accounts, that is very helpful ago. But are you -- is that piece being driven by increasing credit lines for those individuals that are using the line? And obviously, since they're mature accounts, they -- I'm sure they are performing well, credit wise? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes. We are not popping up lines. We've never had, really, an issue with an open to buy. I think, Charles, you may know better than I. But if we have a $500 balance, we may have an $800 line. So there is plenty of room on the open to buy, and we re-score all 40 million accounts every quarter. So it is not a credit line issue. It is more of if I have an 800 line and a 500 balance, and I'm growing it normally 5% a year, how do I get it to 7% or 8%? <br/>And that's basically the whole tender share game, which is, how do I get her to make one more visit if they are not visiting the store itself? A lot of our tender share gains, or I'd say the bulk of it, is coming through online sales, where we reach out to her and make some type of compelling offer to her, and she will go online to buy it. And a lot of this is, to use the lingo, she's snacking online. Meaning that we're seeing a lot of incremental purchases that are relatively small in size, but they are happening very frequently. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bob Napoli</emphasis> (Analyst - William Blair &amp; Company): <br/> Great, thanks. And then just last question. On the agency business on the Epsilon business, is that -- have you lost -- is this just pullback by client? Have you lost some clients? Are you losing share of a client to another competitor or piece. So what's going on there? I don't think the industry has pulled back as much as we saw in your business in the first quarter. And who are you primarily competing with today in those sectors? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> It is a good question. We don't -- one quarter doesn't a trend make, so it still up in the air, in terms of what exactly is [moving on]. All we did see was, we saw project business basically dry up in the first quarter that we had counted on. And as a result, the business we needed to close to make agency hit Q1 did not happen. Now, are those projects beginning to drift back in? It looks like they are slowly drifting back in. So that's all we know at this point. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bob Napoli</emphasis> (Analyst - William Blair &amp; Company): <br/> And who are you seeing as your -- by sector, agency versus tech, who would you point out as your two or three largest and toughest competitors? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> I think it is all over the board, in terms of when it is pure agency, you could have the big Madison Avenue players involved there. You could have some of the other digital smaller agencies involved there. But for the most part, what we do is, we like to link the agency as the tip of the arrow, to get in the door with the CMO to flow through to the big heavy-duty, high-visibility tech platforms that we build for them. The project-based stuff on the agency side, as you can tell, is the stuff that can jerk around quite a bit on a quarterly basis. <br/><br/>So that's what we are seeing. The big tech platforms continue to be built, and it is just these projects on the agency side that we just saw softness in Q1. So we just don't want to get out in front of this thing and start saying, my gosh, we've got long-term weakness in agency, when it could very well just be a one quarter phenomenon. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> So Bob, the only thing I would add is, it's not a case where we're losing clients. It's not a number of clients going away, it's just less spend. So in the first quarter, we really saw less spend going back to its point where on a project basis, CMOs cut their budgets with us for whatever reason. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bob Napoli</emphasis> (Analyst - William Blair &amp; Company): <br/> Great, thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew Jeffrey</emphasis> (Analyst - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey): <br/> Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I guess I want to ask a big pictures strategic question with regard to Epsilon. Is there -- as you think about agency, irrespective of the quarterly volatility in that business, is there still the same competitive strategic rationale for having agency as part of Epsilon as you might have thought there was five years ago? Has your thinking changed on that at all? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> No. I think it is absolutely critical that we have that skill set, because that's the skill set that can get in the door, have the conversation with the CMO. And that will then lead to the pull-through to the big client database work, the big loyalty platform builds, the big CRM business at Conversant. So no, it's -- I think the skill set there is critical, in order to pull through for the other parts of Epsilon. It is almost like even though it is a bit soft this quarter, my view is, if you take it away, what you're going to wind up with is, you are going to cut the head off the rest of the big tech pull-throughs at the rest of Epsilon, and the whole thing will eventually slow down. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew Jeffrey</emphasis> (Analyst - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey): <br/> Okay. And is there -- with regard to, again, agency, is there a customer concentration issue, do you think, within that business? Is that part of the reason we see the volatility? And is there anything you can do about it if there is? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> It is part of it, Andrew. If you look, our biggest clients in Epsilon are all on the agency side of the business. So when they pull back on any project or maybe not supporting a particular offering, they can move the needle quickly. And being project-based, they can do volatility intra-quarter quite a bit for the year. You can pretty well estimate what they are going to do. <br/>But they can basically open up the faucet or close it quite quickly, based upon what they're wanting to do with their marketing spend. And so what we saw in Q1 was, they basically closed the spigot. We think that they will open it up as the year progresses, so we are not sounding alarm bells. But it is big companies, big budgets, and they can flex it quite quickly. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew Jeffrey</emphasis> (Analyst - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey): <br/> Okay. And then quickly, with regard to your outlook for what may be a loss rate plateau in 2018 and beyond. Can you dig a little bit into the rationale or the thought process that gives you confidence that we might see something that's pretty unprecedented, historically, in terms of stable charge-offs? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes, if you look at it, it is a great question. The fact that, as we talked about, the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing, is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well seasoned, well past the peak charge-out cycle, we are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe two more stats might be helpful, which is look, we thought, before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We are saying it is 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that's our long-term run rate? <br/>And that's what we are normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is, with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher-scoring customer, as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we are attracting card holders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today, on average, are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts that we've added recently. <br/><br/>So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also, if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those two together, and that's how you get to, we are not going to normalize out at 6.5% -- we are going to normalize out of 5.5%. But look, it is not like we are trying to keep it lower. The fact is, you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it is a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew Jeffrey</emphasis> (Analyst - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey): <br/> Okay. Appreciate it, thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ashish Sabadra</emphasis> (Analyst - Deutsche Bank): <br/> Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the agency weakness here. So the agency has (inaudible) worsened as well as core Epsilon. I'm just wondering if the 23% decline that you saw that was consistent across both those segments? And then Charles, you mentioned that there is intra-quarter volatility there, depending on the projects. <br/>Is there something you can do strategically, going forward, to lower that volatility? Or is it just that as tech continues to grow faster, it will be a bigger portion of the revenues? I was just wondering, how should we think about the volatility coming down in the agency? Because it has been a volatile over the last several quarters now. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> You are right, Ashish, we are going to have grow the technology piece of the business quicker. That's just frankly where it's going to be. Agency, in a good year, is going to grow 3%. Technology, in a good year, is going to grow 10% plus. So from a mix standpoint, you will basically take some of the volatility away from it. If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon, where we saw we weakness across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint it to any one client, because it was broad-based. <br/>On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we definitely have seen fewer people trying to use their private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic buying through their own trading platforms. So regardless of the quality of the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system. And we just saw a general pull-back there. So that was a little bit unexpected. So I would say it was both sides of it. We do think we will get some stability as the year goes on, but there's really, going back to Ed's point, nothing in particularly we can point to, aside from it just seemed like there was soft spend in Q1. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ashish Sabadra</emphasis> (Analyst - Deutsche Bank): <br/> Okay. Just quickly, on the margins for the Epsilon business, you highlighted a couple of reasons for the margins being lower. But how should we think about margins, going forward? Technically, if agency tends to be a lower margin, tech was higher-margin business. And as tech is growing faster, you would expect the margins to go up, going forward. So just wanted to better understand, how should we think about the dynamics for Epsilon margins over the next several quarters, but also the longer-term? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> So the way you would look at is basically, you are right. Agency will grower slower. It's the lower EBITDA margin. Your technology will grow quicker. It's the highest EBITDA margin, so just from a pure mix standpoint, you should get some EBITDA margin expansion in this year and in the future. Clearly, we will have to look at the agency and play through it. Is this the short-term hiccup or air pocket, as Ed said before? Or is it a case where we have to structurally cut back on cost to get our margins back where they need to be? That's a little bit of the unknown at this point. But long-term, I would expect the margins to expand slightly, based on mix. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ashish Sabadra</emphasis> (Analyst - Deutsche Bank): <br/> Okay, that is very helpful. And one final question, on the gross [and compression]. So the late fees have been weighing on -- the lower late fees have been weighing on. Which is actually better, because it helps you -- or [it's reflective] of the better consumer environment. But just how should we think about that compression? How much visibility or how much confidence do you have that comes off in the second half and going into 2017? Thanks.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes, we have very good visibility into this, as we go into the second half. A large chunk of it, probably half of it, relates to what I call consumer-friendly programs, which I probably should define. It basically means we looked at all of our practices and basically said, how do we continue to be the premier provider in the marketplace, the most customer friendly provider in the marketplace, as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place, as we went into the back half of last year. <br/>So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle, in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we have done is, we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month if they wanted to. And that -- again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. And -- but at the same time, it also helps our OpEx, as you see with the leverage, because we have much lower talk time of people calling up saying, I need a couple more days. So you have that. <br/>You have people who are calling in, where they used to be a fee if you are paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out, as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx, in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. <br/>It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half, is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully that will pay dividends down the line. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ashish Sabadra</emphasis> (Analyst - Deutsche Bank): <br/> Thanks, Ed. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> One more? Okay. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> David Scharf with JMP Securities. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll apologize in advance, Ed, because it is a repeat of some that have been asked, but I just want a clarification. On the agency side, can you give us a sense for how much of the business for agency is so-called project-based? Versus, I guess, work that you would deem to be, while not an annuity, pretty reliable and recurring? <br/>Obviously, it is all based on CMO budgets. But is the vast majority of the business things that you would deem to be quarter-by-quarter project-based, where there isn't necessarily great visibility? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Definitely on the Epsilon side of it, that's the case, where it is -- you've got one or two year contracts, but it is project to project. On the Conversant side, it is going to more volume driven, because it's basically [site display]. Basically, you have got a lot of unpredictability when you get to agency. You can have a longer-term contract, but if it flexes based on volume, predicting what it's going to be on a quarter-to-quarter basis is just a difficult thing to do, David. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Got it. And when we think about the cost structure -- and obviously, the agency business has always had the least amount of operating leverage, given it's people intensive. But can you -- you've talked about, in the disclosure, that agency is roughly maybe one-quarter of the Epsilon segment, the traditional Aspen business plus Conversant. But from the standpoint of the percentage of fixed cost, how should we think about it? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> I would say your premise is right, David, it is a higher fixed cost business. It's more of a people driven business, so variability is pretty low. Part of the reason why you saw that our EBITDA was down quite a bit in the quarter was because the revenue was down on agency, and it doesn't flex very much. <br/>So you are right, I don't have an exact percentage. But you can assume it is our highest fixed cost business would be within agency. So if we see it's a structural issue in the market, then we'll have to go through and address the fixed cost. And we can do so pretty quickly if we need to.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Okay. And as we think about the description of a lessening degree of revenue decline in Q2, 23% is a big number. Should we be thinking 15% to 20% down, or more closer to 10%? Just trying to get a little bit of context. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Yes, I don't think we are in a position to really say that at this point, as to what it is going to be. We do feel good that it's going to get better. We had a difficult comp in Q1, so we know it's going to be less than Q2. But at this stage, it would be very difficult for me to quantify it for Q2, Q3, Q4. <br/>As you know, David, we look at our guidance in total, not in any single piece. So just like in the first quarter we had over-performance in some areas and weakness in other, we would look for the year to be the same way. So it's very difficult for me to quantify that for you by quarter, David. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Got it. And as you referenced, a little bit of loosening in Q2, maybe some of the project-based expected or hoped for backlog is starting to materialize again. Are those coming specifically from those larger clients that may have pulled back unexpectedly? Or are these new wins, new contracts? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Charles Horn</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> I would say it is a little bit of both. You do have some new wins coming through, and we'll look to focus on that during the course of the year. And I do think you're going to see budgets open up a little bit with us as the year progresses, as well. <br/>As Ed said, before, we think there was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction with CMOs in Q1. I know I was told over and over we heading into a recession quite quickly in the US. So I think many people listen to the rhetoric, and I think on project-based, discretionary-based marketing, I think pulled back a little bit in Q1. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Got it. And then just lastly, on the card side. It sounded like some pretty guarded or crafted language regarding the two programs that won't be renewed. But is it fair to say -- should we think of that as two retailer partners that perhaps are not willing to commit as much marketing push behind the product as before? Basically deemphasizing the store card as one of their marketing tools? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Yes. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Scharf</emphasis> (Analyst - JMP Securities): <br/> Got it. Okay, thanks very much, guys. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Heffernan</emphasis> (President and CEO): <br/> Okay. All right, everyone, thank you. We will see you next quarter. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. <br/>All rights reserved (c) 2014 TheStreet, Inc.<br/>Please feel free to quote up to 200 words per transcript.

Obviously, the Company combines digital marketing with loyalty and private label. While there is obviously a number of moving pieces across all of their businesses, clearly, the Company is set up for a very strong finish to the year and into next year. So please join me in welcoming <person><nameText>Ed Heffernan. </nameText></person>Thank you, Ed, for participating again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to start off with my seven years experience of ADS. I feel like there has been no shortage of excitement and controversy in the name. Historically, it centered around one segment, maybe two. Last year, it plagued all of your businesses, some not within your control, so to speak, but I think it has left investors wondering whether it's an indication of the pieces not fitting together and perhaps you could just talk about why you continue to believe the pieces fit together and what's going to prove that thesis out.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ALLIANCE DATA </nameText></person>SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Sure. Again, with Alliance, it is a business that is very different. If you start with -- I know this is a heavy reliance on financial services, but we are not a bank. It's a non-bank holdco that allows us to have both a financial institution that is regulated, as well as a number of other assets that a traditional bank can't own like all the data-driven and analytical stuff that we do.</p><p>And so it comes back to the founding of the Company way back when when we started it back in the late 1990s. The whole thesis was that there should be a way to take data that is flying around all these networks and transaction processors and use that information to gain insight into the consumer, which will then allow you to market in a very precise fashion to those consumers.</p><p>And what we did is we essentially said, all right, our job is to build a bunch of platforms and they are going to appeal to different verticals. And so in areas such as specialty apparel, specialty retail, so apparel, jewelry, high-end home furnishings, things like that, the private label card, so it's a loyalty platform with liquidity attached to it, is very appealing.</p><p>If you move into the auto space or financial services and other verticals, they might not want that piece and they just want the loyalty platform, so we will be the Citibank Thank You platform; we will build Hilton Honors and the Walgreens. Those are huge loyalty programs.</p><p>In other parts of the world, like in Canada, it was deemed more appropriate to have all the big verticals come together and build a coalition loyalty program. So the bottom line of the Company is that we have a bunch of collection devices, which are platforms.</p><p>Some of it offers up a liquidity component, which is the credit card. Some of it is just the loyalty component. Some of it is just a coalition loyalty, but the whole point is to extract the data and information and use that to do targeted marketing and that's where it all fits together and it's more challenging when we describe it to investors and Wall Street because people tend to be a bit more focused on I'm in financial services, or I'm in marketing, or I'm in e-commerce or something like that.</p><p>We cut across it, so it does make sense from the viewpoint of build platforms to collect information, use the information to market to the customers' clients. That's what we do.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: I appreciate that. From your discussions with investors, what do you think they need to see to regain confidence in the story and get the stock back to historical valuation levels?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think for those of you who know me, I'm certainly not shy about being fairly blunt. I think we've gone through different cycles in all the years that I've been there and sometimes there are macro issues. Sometimes there are legal issues or regulatory issues. Sometimes there are client issues that all can knock you off course. And I think we've certainly had our share of those over the past couple of years and our goal is to basically use this year as the year where we don't have any of those little surprises. We think we have essentially tripped over every single one that is out there and we've set up the Company at this point where it's no longer going to be a macro issue or a regulatory issue. We either execute or we don't.</p><p>We have three businesses. All three businesses have very specific targets and goals that must be met for this year and those are all internal. There are no real external things that we are worried about and as a result, if the three businesses execute, what you'll see is you will move to a strong double-digit growth as we enter Q3, Q4 and then the acceleration for 2018, you are looking at essentially doubling the growth rate of the Company for 2018, what we call our slingshot effect.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: I think you have been clear in that you think the stock is undervalued given the fundamentals you've just outlined. You have mentioned you are going to remain aggressive with the share buyback. You have a $500 million authorization. How should we think about the remaining uses of free cash flow?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. If you look at our Company and if you look at the card business, if we grow the card business $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year in the portfolio, then you are going to need to set aside capital equal to roughly 15% of that growth. So that's the first use of capital.</p><p>The next piece would be, at least in today's environment, we have allocated a fair amount to share buybacks to the tune of I think we did about $800 million last year. Our first leg up this year is $500 million and that has taken precedence.</p><p>The past couple years, we instituted a dividend at the end of last year, which seemed to be something that folks were looking for. But, at the end of the day, we are a growth company and if you looked at our track record over the last 10 years, we've grown both top line and earnings double digit for the last 15 years.</p><p>So I would like to get back to enhancing the organic growth rate, which is probably in the high single digits with a little bit of M&amp;A. Once we get out of this funk here and get moving and grooving in the back half, you look at a combo of capital for growth in the card business in terms of the portfolio. You will have capital for stock repurchases and you will have capital for very modest M&amp;A. If I could do a third, a third, a third, that would be great given our operating cash flow is well north of $1 billion.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And when we think about M&amp;A, what are you looking towards, which segments?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: We very much like the business in brand loyalty, which is based out of the Netherlands, which does loyalty programs for grocers. That's been growing steadily at I'd say 10% a year. We think that can expand even faster, so we would look for something there.</p><p>We would also look to enhance our digital and data capabilities at both BrandLoyalty and our business in Canada and at Epsilon. And there's nothing big hanging out there.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And would it be in the US or broad -- it could be broader?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It could be either.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Got it. Maybe shifting gears to private label first since it's a card conference. For 2017, there was some moderation in receivables growth expected, 15% versus the 20% in 2016. You've talked about same-store sales comps being weaker. Maybe you could just talk about the trajectory of that growth going forward given this backdrop because I think it caught some people by surprise.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I don't think it's to anyone's surprise as to how soft the holiday season was for your more traditional retailers and that has a direct impact on us. So typically, retailers would grow let's say 3% comps year-over-year and the way our business is set up, our goal is, or our whole mousetrap is our ability to get deeper and deeper into the consumer's mindset and increase their spend. And so if the retailer did 3%, our growth rate from that retailer could be more like 8%.</p><p>So that's called tender share gain and that is essentially after she has purchased one item, our ability to know about that item down to the SKU level and then go back and reach her and convince her that the shoes and the belt and everything else would be an ideal complement to the initial purchase has been very successful.</p><p>So our goal is our first 8 points of growth traditionally came out of that core business. That core business is now running at minus 1%, minus 2% from holiday and that essentially means that we will still add 5 points onto that, but you go from minus 2% to plus 3%, not plus 3% to plus 8%. So our whole core has shifted down by about 5 points and as a result, we need to figure out, okay, should we figure out a way to board another -- it would take us probably another three new clients a year to make up that difference and the answer right now is, yes, we think that offsetting that has been this massive secular trend that has moved the dollars and marketing budgets away from TV and newspaper and mail inserts and circulars and all that other stuff and has shifted it over to this data-driven targeted marketing.</p><p>So you have a negative on comps, but you have a positive on the secular trend. The net result is we are going to be able to hold serve, so to speak and the growth rate of the file between 15% and 20% a year seems very sustainable for the next several years based on the pipeline. We've got about 350 potential clients that we think fit our sandbox. We have 155 of them today, so we are about halfway through and the vast bulk of the majority don't have a program. It's not like they are with someone else. They just allocated their dollars traditionally to other areas of marketing and now they are all shifting back over to compete with some of the pure online players.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: You alluded to this before, but a lot of the pressure that we are seeing in retail is in apparel and at malls. Could you just talk about why you might not necessarily be as concerned, why you think you can still post double-digit growth in that backdrop outside of just the -- spooling new relationships?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I think there are areas that are growing quite well. So the specialty beauty places are doing quite well. Fast fashion is doing quite well and then the pure e-commerce players are doing quite well.</p><p>So what you are seeing is you are almost looking like at a fragmentation of the department store. So for those of you who have been in department stores, there are sometimes three or four different specialty brands that sell their products within the overall department store and what they're doing is they are breaking away and they are creating their own e-commerce sites. And so this fragmentation is taking sales away from your more traditional players and that is where we need to step in and say, hey, our ability to board and to spool up these smaller specialty pure play type retailers, that's going to be a key piece of our focus going forward.</p><p>The second thing would be on the digital side and of course, everyone talks all digital all the time, but we view it as a nice complement to the bricks. And so you are going to hear more and more about what we call bricks and mobile. That is going to be the new thing that you are going to hear about. No one shops anymore without first being on their mobile device looking at pricing and that's what's causing all the compression in the margins. But don't forget, 85% of sales are still done at the physical store itself and 15% is online.</p><p>For us, almost 40% of our sales are online, which essentially means that we are taking the information from the store purchase, looking at it, figuring out how do we get the next incremental purchase out of that customer and using that intel to go out and reach her and provide her with an offer that she can get excited about and that will drive these incremental sales over and over and over again and that's how we build up our tender share that frankly at some of our clients we are at 50% or 60% of sales are flowing through our product and overall for the Company, we are only at 30%.</p><p>So there's quite a ways to go with tender share and the more focused on data and digital and identifying who she is, what she bought down to the SKU level is only to our benefit.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: I'm glad you knocked out my tender share question.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I tried.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Appreciate it. So one more on just the pipeline and I guess the sandbox. I think that you have talked historically about the numbers of opportunities there are and how big you are today. Could you just refresh us on that and maybe just talk about your comfort in expanding the pot?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Look, at the end of the day, you've got -- the card market, as people know, is primarily Visa/MasterCard. It's massive portfolios with huge clients. That's not us. We tend to be very focused. Our average portfolio size is about $60 million or $70 million. Our typical customer or client's customer is -- 93% are female and they typically have this as not their primary card. They use one of the big Visa/MasterCard products or a co-brand product and that's fine with us. We want this to be her favorite brand and view it as a loyalty program.</p><p>So you have $500 balances and $800 credit lines that are just a fraction of the big co-brands and that's fine with us. Most of the other, I think, folks that you are going to hear are talking about these multi-billion dollar files and everything else. We are not competitive frankly in those areas. We are not competitive in co-brand. We are not really competitive with a general-purpose bankcard and the reason for that is pretty straightforward, which is our whole model is based upon someone who has multiple transactions, 8 to 10 trips a year whether it's to the mall or to the computer and using that information to drive very targeted sales.</p><p>And we find that those are usually areas where you have retailers with very, very strong brand presence and view their brand as everything and so they are willing to spend a lot to build up these brands and for us, that's our specialty, that's what we are good at. Everything is done in house from the underwriting, to the network and processing, the closed loop is within our house. The customer care is US-based and all the data and marketing is done in-house as well.</p><p>So everyone must sign up for all of this and for us to do that, we can't accept a return that you are seeing today on some of these co-brand deals of a couple of points, ROAs and stuff like that; that doesn't work for us. And so we go for smaller clients, have a very deep vertical relationship with those clients and as a result, we tend to have returns, ROEs that are 30% plus; ROAs in the 800 basis points, 700 basis points. It's just a very unique product and that's what we are focused on.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And your competitors talk about doing more of that and I guess I was just wondering how you feel about the competition and their relative positioning compared to previous years.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think from a competitive perspective, what I have seen is, again, we have 20% of our book is co-brand, but 85% of that is an add-on to an existing private label relationship.</p><p>So I think the competitive set that outsources a lot of other functions, they are focused on big balances, big portfolios because they are big. To move the needle, you need big numbers. When you start getting into personalized service for a $70 million file, it's harder and harder for the real big banks to do that and as a result, we carved out our area.</p><p>Now everyone is going to talk about digital this and data that and that's fine, but our name is Alliance Data and of our 18,000 people, we probably have 12,000 of them that are focused on data in marketing as opposed to it's more of a nice to have, we want to grow that piece of the business. That is our business and the credit piece is merely a means to an end to get to the data.</p><p>So our whole heritage comes from the retailer side when the Company was formed in the late 1990s through some assets from The Limited and from JCPenney and so it's a very different sort of founding and growth from a traditional bank.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: So my final question on private label and I would be remiss not to talk about it is credit quality.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Really?</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Obviously, you guys have gone on a limb and given us a projection of how you expect credit to trend over the course of the year. What gives you the confidence that you will execute against those goals?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, it's two things. The first thing we do is, again, with 155 clients, what we do is we will go portfolio by portfolio, vintage by vintage and do a bottoms-up approach across every single file and see how things are trending. We knew at the beginning of 2016 that this so-called normalization process, whereby loss rates which were abnormally low by historical standards, were beginning to normalize to a run rate more consistent with what we are used to.</p><p>A lot of that had to do with coming out of the Great Recession. All you had were these super high FICO or scored accounts that were acceptable and now people have repaired their credit and you're getting to a more normalized level.</p><p>What that effectively did last year and this year is it knocked 10 points of growth off of our growth rate. We will still grow double digit, that's against a headwind of 10 to 12 percentage points on your earnings per share from this normalization process when you are also growing so quickly.</p><p>So you've got those two big things. So the concept is gosh, when that finally stabilizes and normalizes, the math gets very simple. Your growth rate doubles. You eliminate 10 to 12 points of drag. It's that simple. It's just math. And so the question is when is that going to happen and so what you are going to see this year -- let me talk about losses and delinquencies.</p><p>From a loss rate perspective, you had a business that was growing 27% last year and at that growth rate, those were when the losses started to get generated and they are flowing through in the first half of this year and that's why the loss rate for the first half of the year will have a 6 handle or a 6 as the first digit and then by Q3, you are actually going to drop below 5.5 because that piece has been cleaned out of the system because you are going from a 27% growth rate to a 15%.</p><p>What that does is you have the denominator effect that causes those losses to seem higher than they normally would. That result is that flows through the system in the first half. Back half, Q3 will below 5.5 and by that point, we are basically at that, hey, we are normalizing out here.</p><p>What gives us the comfort that that normalization is going to happen? To us, it's all driven by delinquencies. The correlation between delinquencies are when an account gets behind on their and when the actual loss hits your P&amp;L is 180 days. So you should be able to look out 180 days and figure out what your loss rate will be.</p><p>And so as we look at these delinquencies, you would see last year they were going up 50 basis points, 50 basis points, oh, and the loss rate went up 50, 60 basis points. This year, it looks like the same thing. They are beginning to go up 50, 60 basis points, something like that and then what we are saying is then it's going to start to narrow and that's called the wedge.</p><p>And so as we move into the middle of the year, what you are going to see are those delinquency rates getting closer and closer together so that by the fall they will actually touch. And when they touch, that means you fully normalized, which therefore means the losses that will flow out three to six months after that will be at the same rate as the prior year. That will cause your growth to accelerate by 10 or 12 percentage points. That's the slingshot.</p><p>So the question right now is, okay, we need to watch this wedge close as the year progresses and that's essentially there is nothing more we can do at that point is just put the numbers up and see that it closes. I will say that I think we are going to be pretty darn close to the wedge. I will say -- I do have to say that there's been a big delay in the tax refunds for -- help me out here -- with the childcare credit.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: There's just been an overall delay in getting people back their refund.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, there's like a 45-day delay so that delinquency levels, which normally would be relatively flat, will blip up about 20 basis points in February and then start dropping back down again. So it's transitory. It doesn't change the loss profile. It doesn't change where the wedge is going, but everyone should be aware that there's about $100 billion that the government delayed from early January to late February and these were usually used to cure delinquent accounts. That's going away starting the latter part of March.</p><p>We saw -- actually we heard last Wednesday -- you will hear this from other companies -- last Wednesday is when we started to see money in the system. So it looks like it was almost precisely a 40-day delay on that, but otherwise the wedge looks good. We will get to where we need to be and then have a slingshot into 2018.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. I'm going to shift gears to Epsilon because I think it's an equal, if not -- it's an equally important topic for this year. You have talked about accelerating revenue growth towards the back part of the year, turning around specifically from the technology platform's offering. Maybe you could just talk about what the execution risks are there because I think it's obviously a big part of the turnaround there.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. So Epsilon, which has a number of different data and digital products, probably 70%, 75% of Epsilon is currently growing at 6% or 7% and looks like that's in pretty good shape.</p><p>The area where we got tripped up on is our big tech platform business, again, the business that builds those massive loyalty programs like Hilton Honors and Citi Thank You and everything else. For as long as I could remember, that used to grow 8% a year year after year after year. Last year, it declined 5%. And that's what dragged down all of Epsilon.</p><p>And as we dug into it, what we found was that the market had shifted dramatically and we were off on two things -- price point and time to deliver. And specifically, we or the DNA of Epsilon with 8,000 engineers is to build the coolest thing out there. And for those of you who are engineers, you can't stop tinkering with anything until it's basically, hey, pencils down.</p><p>So that was the case at Epsilon and we built the fanciest things out there, these platforms with bells and whistles and they are still awesome and they cost a lot of money and they took 12 months to deliver. Well, what we found out from CMOs is, hey, 12 months, that ain't going to cut it anymore; I need it in three and I need it for 20% less because they are after my budget.</p><p>And that is not our DNA and we had a very difficult time adjusting to it to be quite honest. To get the price point fixed, we needed to, for the first time, open up a very significant office in India with engineers over there. We have about 1,000 people there now. We have our labor costs now in line where the price point is right. Now we essentially need to come up with a shrink-wrapped product that has maybe 80% of the functionality and can be delivered in three months and doesn't have all the bells and whistles and that's what we are working on right now.</p><p>And we expect -- we are already selling it into the marketplace. We expect deliveries to start in July and that's basically what we are doing to fix the issue. So if we go from minus 5% or 6% decline to just flat by the end of the year, that's when you'll see all of Epsilon then start growing at that 6% or 7% growth rate on a go-forward basis as we move into maybe plus 2% in 2018.</p><p>So they are not huge hurdles that we are trying to hit, but from a DNA perspective, from a cultural perspective, you are basically asking people to stop building the Ferrari and deliver to the market something that is less expensive and doesn't have all the bells and whistles that it used to have and that's what we are working through right now.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: So the execution risk for this year, is it that you are not able to sell it into the market, or is there a pipeline that helps the second half of the year?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: The pipeline actually looks pretty good. Our biggest question to CMOs had to do with is this something you really want to do in-house? Do you want a SaaS-based solution where you hire 100 analysts and run the thing in-house, or do you want us to do all of that and it's really just a question of price and delivery time. And the answer came back a little bit of both, so I think there's going to be markets where I think you are going to have a number of CMOs who want control of it and will have a SaaS-based solution in-house with 100 analysts and then there will be our solution where we will do everything and the CMO can sit there and run the business and sell cars or whatever they are supposed to sell.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: So you suspect that will continue to evolve within your own customer base as well?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And so you are going to have to attract other people that use SaaS-based platforms as well?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, the good news is everyone is shifting all their money over to this stuff. Everyone out there -- you talk to any CMO, their marketing dollars are going dramatically faster towards this anything data-driven that can give insights into who their customer is, how do I get hold of a prospect, how do I reach them over all these different channels and that means that the overall sandbox is growing and all we want is our piece of the full-service offering and then you'll have the SaaS-based offering over here.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: I'm going to get one in on loyalty and then I'm going to go to the audience. So put together your questions, audience. Obviously, with loyalty, the no-expiry model is back into play. Some of it is beyond your control based on what happened legislatively there.</p><p>But I guess the key here is customer engagement going forward as you guys evolve the business model. How do you foresee that evolving? What are the risks that those customers don't engage as they did before?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: For those of you who missed the end of last year, it got pretty entertaining around Thanksgiving when the Parliament in Ontario decided to outlaw what we did for a living and that was essentially disallowed our ability to expire points after five years and therefore, we couldn't recognize those earnings.</p><p>So after that took place, we obviously needed to think about how do we retool this model to get back to a level of profitability where we were before and that's what we are doing right now. It's really not the most ideal way of going through the transition, but essentially what we are doing is this is a massive coalition program with two-thirds of Canadians enrolled in this program, so it's the national consumer coalition program for all of Canada and what we are doing is, for the first time, we are working with suppliers; we are working across the various reward categories to find ways whereby we can recapture that margin that was lost through the change in the law.</p><p>Said differently, we fully expect to be back to an EBITDA margin of 25%, 26% by Q3 of this year with the changes we are making to the model. That should be pretty straightforward.</p><p>The second thing is did we do damage to the brand with all the noise that was up there? And there was a lot of noise. If anyone is from Canada, it was quite a scene. And what we found fortunately from our sponsors, the people who are in the coalition is, everyone is standing pat. Everyone had to make some noise, but right now across the board they are basically saying get on with it. We've got businesses to run. Let's move past it. Let's get back in the game here and let's reengage and that's what we are doing.</p><p>So for the first half of this year, a lot of our efforts will be re-engaging with the collectors to make sure they know the value of the program, make sure that they feel like they are not getting stiffed, that this thing actually has true value and we are spending a lot of money to get that message across.</p><p>And so the proof of it will be probably as we move into really the back half of this year, the issuance level of these points or miles needs to return to plus 3%, plus 4% for us to know for certain that the engagement has worked.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Cool. Audience, any questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So just in terms of -- on the private label side, I know you guys always have contingency plans around different scenarios, but if the wedge doesn't completely match or doesn't play out perfectly as you guys expect, what's the contingency plan for -- if Charles were here or your [son] -- are there other options you guys can do to try to get that wedge back in order? And I'm not saying I don't think it's going to happen, just wondering about contingency if possible.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, it's a fair question. You are basically questioning whether or not we are going to fully normalize our loss rate before the end of this year and as a result allow for that slingshot into 2018 and the question is what happens if it takes a little bit longer, what happens if you are not right? What does that mean?</p><p>I would say right now that everything seems to suggest that it is going to close very nicely as we start heading into the spring and then the summer and if it, for whatever reason, were off a bit, there are a number of things you can do. You can be more aggressive on the new client signings and so you start moving your growth rate back from 15% to more like 20%. If you do that, then, by definition, you are going to have -- you are not going to have that grow-over issue when you slow like we are this year. That would be one thing we would do.</p><p>If we are off a little bit and the earnings are coming in a little bit lighter, which I don't think they will, but you asked the question, fortunately, we have a lot of free cash flow. We would continue to be very aggressive from a buyback perspective until the wedge does close.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, thanks.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Other questions in the room? So I've got a question on the agency part of the business for Epsilon. Obviously, four to five years ago, the big push was to get the agency model or businesses to really drive the deals. When you look across the industry, the agency growth rates have been stronger than what you are seeing. Could you maybe just explain what's happening at Epsilon versus what we are seeing in the industry and whether or not you believe moving to that agency-heavy model has made sense?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Actually, if you recall, in Q4, we actually saw growth return pretty nicely to agency, so the Epsilon agency business is growing 4% to 5% today. So I think we had a couple of speed bumps there in terms of some clients curtailing some of their spend, but the agency piece is running 4% or 5%, which is about what we want it.</p><p>The one piece of agency that continues to suffer would be the old value-click business that provided inventory to the big Madison Avenue agencies. That's become more of a commodity. It's 4% of overall Epsilon, so it's not really affecting growth anymore, but the traditional agency stuff is actually back into growth mode.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. I think we are going to have to end it right there. Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay.

Aksoy joins managing partners George Ugras and Miles Kirby in the leadership of the $170 million fund, which focuses on early-stage investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, healthcare and mobility.\u00a0</p><p>Aksoy joins from Google Cloud, where he ran the media and entertainment vertical, helping broadcasters conduct their business operations without legacy servers. He d previously founded a data visualization startup that ultimately went belly up, invested in startups personally and then joined video streaming startup Avanto as chief financial officer. Aksoy ended up at Google when the tech giant acquired Avanto in 2016.\u00a0</p><p>The cloud exec isn t new to venture capital. Earlier in his career, he was an investor at Intel Capital, the venture arm of chipmaker Intel, leading several successful exits. But unlike some investors who look to work their way up the ranks within one shop, Aksoy says he was eager to start again at the bottom as an entrepreneur.  Unless you really understand the pains of the founder, it s really hard to add value [as an investor], so I took almost a 5-year break from venture capital,  he says.\u00a0</p><p>That corporate investor to founder and big-tech exec journey made Aksoy attractive to AV8 Ventures, which says it operates independently but counts German asset management and insurance giant Allianz as its sole limited partner. To Ugras, Aksoy brings a founder-empathetic approach that contrasts with a sea of  transactional  investors in the market.  This business was started in the 1960s and it was really about company-building,  he says   something AV8 believes is lost in the age of the unicorn.</p><p>Aksoy says he plans to invest in startups that help companies manage their data in the wake of new privacy regulations in Europe and California, integrate cloud software with existing on-premise systems and protect digital assets against cyber threats.</p><p>He joins a firm that while young   its fund only formally closed in April   has made seven investments to date, including home healthcare workflow platform Swift Shift and Contract Wrangler, which is applying machine learning to contracts, as well as startups in healthcare, weather and autonomous trucking. Ugras says the firm hopes to see Aksoy continue its efforts in finding real use cases for the buzzy machine learning category, one he says hasn t fulfilled its heady promise so far.</p><p>While AV8 is far from the only cloud-focused or corporate-backed VC firm, Aksoy and his colleagues hope their approach will stand out against a Silicon Valley culture currently obsessed with success and victory laps.  I hear some investors talking about their investments and bets,  says Aksoy.  We are not that. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5d659ff19dafc1000964391c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXM-B7J1-DXVP-500R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 28, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002PWJ</classCode><className>ALLIANZ SE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

University Health System, a San Antonio-based public hospital, will train students and school employees to use them. </p><p>No public money for embryo research </p><p>Arkansas lawmakers voted to prohibit state funding of human cloning or destructive embryo research, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">stating that</url> the \u201cprospect of creating new human life solely to be exploited or destroyed has been condemned on moral grounds as displaying a profound disrespect for a human life.\u201d </p><p>The new law will also block funds to state educational institutions investigating stem cell research using embryos. In vitro fertilization, however, will not be affected. </p><p>Arizona, Maryland and Missouri prohibit the use of state funds to pay for reproductive cloning, while North Dakota, South Dakota and Oklahoma are the only states to ban all forms of human cloning.</p><p>A groundbreaking data privacy law </p><p>Wondering why you\u2019re seeing a flurry of \u201cupdates to our terms of service and privacy policy\u201d emails in your inbox?</p><p>California, home of some of the country\u2019s big tech giants, such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo, is rolling out a landmark digital privacy law that will regulate data collection from consumers. The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">California Consumer Privacy Act</url> requires companies to comply with new privacy and transparency standards. </p><p>Consumers will be able to request access to information that tech companies have collected about them and ask that the data be deleted. Users can also opt out of companies selling their personal data \u2014 including photos, and information on what they buy and where they go \u2014 to other businesses. </p><p>California is the first place to implement such a law in the United States. In 2018, the European Union\u2019s data protection law took effect, protecting all residents in the member countries. </p><p>Recreational marijuana  expands in the Midwest </p><p>Illinois will become the 11th state in the country, and the second in the Midwest, to legalize recreational marijuana sales and use. As early as 6 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day, anyone 21 and over with a valid driver\u2019s license will be able to purchase cannabis products at state-licensed stores. </p><p>The state has approved 35 medical cannabis dispensaries to sell pot and other products. There are, however, limits on how much an individual can purchase: 30 grams of marijuana, 500 milligrams of edibles and five grams of concentrated THC oils. </p><p>A ban on alligator products, blocked</p><p>The state was set to institute a ban on any merchandise made of alligator or crocodile skin, including popular boots and handbags, until the Louisiana attorney general\u2019s office filed a lawsuit and a federal judge issued a hold.</p><p>\u201cThe temporary restraining order is the first step in protecting Louisiana\u2019s alligator industry, which creates jobs, supports our economy and contributes to much-needed coastal restoration efforts,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said in a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">news release</url> Friday.</p><p>Louisiana is the United States\u2019 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">leading producer of alligator skins</url>, according to the Louisiana Alligator Advisory Council. In 2017, the alligator industry generated almost $100 million for the state, the group said.</p><p>California will still go ahead with a ban on cosmetics companies importing or selling products that have been tested on animals.</p><p>Ending cash bail could release thousands of inmates</p><p>New York will become the latest state to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">eliminate cash bail</url> for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, which could see more than 40 percent of inmates released from pretrial detention, according to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">the Center for Court Innovation</url>. </p><p>Bail can still be set for people accused of more violent crimes, including sexual offenses, domestic abuse, witness tampering and conspiracy to commit murder. When deciding whether to set bail on those cases, judges are still expected to consider the defendant\u2019s financial ability to pay.</p><p>Over the past few years, several states have taken similar steps as part of an effort to reduce the criminalization of poverty. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">California became the first state</url> to abolish cash bail entirely last year.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">New Jersey has also all but eliminated cash bail</url>, while New Mexico has minimized its use.</p><p>Previous salary: Don\u2019t ask, you\u2019re not allowed</p><p>Employers in New Jersey<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">will be banned</url> from screening applicants based on their past salaries or benefits history or asking what they previously earned, a rule intended to address the gender wage gap and promote equal pay among workers. Seventeen states \u2014 including California, Hawaii and Maine \u2014 have passed similar laws. And in recent years, such laws at the county level have been passed across the country. </p><p>Another \u2018red flag\u2019 law to reduce gun violence</p><p>Since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, Colorado has suffered several more mass shootings. The state will now become the latest to implement a \u201cred flag\u201d law, which will allow family members or law enforcement officials to petition a court to confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others. </p><p>Colorado follows in the footsteps of at least <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">17 states</url>, including Florida, New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana and California, which have approved some version of a red flag law. In Colorado, the seizure of firearms can be extended to 364 days, after which the burden of proof is on owners to have their firearms returned.</p><p>Gift cards, composting and zero-emission vehicles</p><p>Some new state laws won\u2019t take effect until the summer. Beginning July 1, businesses in Washington State will be banned from putting expiration dates on gift cards. The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">new law</url> will protect recipients if they do not use their gift cards in a timely fashion, and service charges will no longer be allowed. </p><p>Vermont residents will not be able to throw peels, eggshells, seeds, pits, bones, coffee grounds, loose-leaf tea, oil and other food scraps in landfills beginning on July 1. Trucking companies will be required by the state\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/news/43206\">universal recycling law</url> to provide scrap collection services to all residents and businesses. Supermarkets and restaurants will also have to comply with mandatory composting across the state. </p><p>Car owners across a number of states, including California, Hawaii, Kansas and Alabama, will be charged fees to register \u201czero emission\u201d vehicles in the new year. With the growing trend of green technology, these special fees, which range from $50 to $200, are expected to make up lost gas-tax revenue that pays for upgrading and repairing roads and bridges across the country.</p><p>PHOTO: California is trying to ban products\u00a0made of alligator and crocodile.

In vitro fertilization, however, will not be affected.</p><p>Arizona, Maryland and Missouri prohibit the use of state funds to pay for reproductive cloning, while North Dakota, South Dakota and Oklahoma are the only states to ban all forms of human cloning.</p><p>California</p><p>A groundbreaking data privacy law</p><p>Wondering why youre seeing a flurry of updates to our terms of service and privacy policy emails in your inbox?</p><p>California, home of some of the countrys big tech giants, such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo, is rolling out a landmark digital privacy law that will regulate data collection from consumers. The California Consumer Privacy Act requires companies to comply with new privacy and transparency standards.</p><p>Consumers will be able to request access to information that tech companies have collected about them and ask that the data be deleted. Users can also opt out of companies selling their personal data including photos, and information on what they buy and where they go to other businesses.</p><p>California is the first place to implement such a law in the United States. In 2018, the European Unions data protection law took effect, protecting all residents in the member countries.</p><p>Illinois</p><p>Recreational marijuana expands in the Midwest</p><p>Illinois will become the 11th state in the country, and the second in the Midwest, to legalize recreational marijuana sales and use. As early as 6 a.m. on New Years Day, anyone 21 and over with a valid drivers license will be able to purchase cannabis products at state-licensed stores.</p><p>The state has approved 35 medical cannabis dispensaries to sell pot and other products. There are, however, limits on how much an individual can purchase: 30 grams of marijuana, 500 milligrams of edibles and five grams of concentrated THC oils.</p><p>California</p><p>A ban on alligator products, blocked</p><p>The state was set to institute a ban on any merchandise made of alligator or crocodile skin, including popular boots and handbags, until the Louisiana attorney generals office filed a lawsuit and a federal judge issued a hold.</p><p>The temporary restraining order is the first step in protecting Louisianas alligator industry, which creates jobs, supports our economy and contributes to much-needed coastal restoration efforts, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said in a news release Friday.</p><p>Louisiana is the United States leading producer of alligator skins , according to the Louisiana Alligator Advisory Council. In 2017, the alligator industry generated almost $100 million for the state, the group said.</p><p>California will still go ahead with a ban on cosmetics companies importing or selling products that have been tested on animals.</p><p>NEW YORK</p><p>Ending cash bail could release thousands of inmates</p><p>New York will become the latest state to eliminate cash bail for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, which could see more than 40 percent of inmates released from pretrial detention, according to the Center for Court Innovation .</p><p>Bail can still be set for people accused of more violent crimes, including sexual offenses, domestic abuse, witness tampering and conspiracy to commit murder. When deciding whether to set bail on those cases, judges are still expected to consider the defendants financial ability to pay.</p><p>Over the past few years, several states have taken similar steps as part of an effort to reduce the criminalization of poverty. California became the first state to abolish cash bail entirely last year. New Jersey has also all but eliminated cash bail , while New Mexico has minimized its use.</p><p>New Jersey</p><p>Previous salary: Dont ask, youre not allowed</p><p>Employers in New Jersey will be banned from screening applicants based on their past salaries or benefits history or asking what they previously earned, a rule intended to address the gender wage gap and promote equal pay among workers. Seventeen states including California, Hawaii and Maine have passed similar laws. And in recent years, such laws at the county level have been passed across the country.</p><p>Colorado</p><p>Another red flag law to reduce gun violence</p><p>Since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, Colorado has suffered several more mass shootings. The state will now become the latest to implement a red flag law, which will allow family members or law enforcement officials to petition a court to confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others.</p><p>Colorado follows in the footsteps of at least 17 states , including Florida, New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana and California, which have approved some version of a red flag law. In Colorado, the seizure of firearms can be extended to 364 days, after which the burden of proof is on owners to have their firearms returned.</p><p>LOOKING AHEAD</p><p>Gift cards, composting and zero-emission vehicles</p><p>Some new state laws wont take effect until the summer. Beginning July 1, businesses in Washington State will be banned from putting expiration dates on gift cards. The new law will protect recipients if they do not use their gift cards in a timely fashion, and service charges will no longer be allowed.</p><p>Vermont residents will not be able to throw peels, eggshells, seeds, pits, bones, coffee grounds, loose-leaf tea, oil and other food scraps in landfills beginning on July 1. Trucking companies will be required by the states universal recycling law to provide scrap collection services to all residents and businesses. Supermarkets and restaurants will also have to comply with mandatory composting across the state.</p><p>Car owners across a number of states, including California, Hawaii, Kansas and Alabama, will be charged fees to register zero emission vehicles in the new year. With the growing trend of green technology, these special fees, which range from $50 to $200, are expected to make up lost gas-tax revenue that pays for upgrading and repairing roads and bridges across the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en020138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWS-3WH1-JD88-32KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1325\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Well, they`re not calling them impeachment proceedings but one week from today, the House Judiciary Committee will hold the first in a series of hearings on what its announcement refers to as \"presidential obstruction and other crimes.\"</p><p>House Judiciary is, of course, the committee responsible for starting the impeachment process should they choose to do so and at least half the Democratic members of that committee are now on the record calling for just that.</p><p>As of tonight, a total of 58 House members have come out in support of a formal impeachment inquiry, a number of this grown steadily since Robert Mueller told the public last week in his own voice that he was unable to conclude that the President is not a criminal.</p><p>Lawmakers were back in Washington today for the first time since Mueller broke his silence after spending the past week working in their home districts. During that time, some of them were confronted by voters demanding they get more aggressive including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whose speech at the California Democratic Party Convention was interrupted by calls were impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: Why is it that the President won`t defend our democracy from this foreign threat? What is the president covering up? The report lays out 11 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the President of the United States. I told you this is like coming home for me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Another member of House Democratic leadership, House Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson told me that he decided to come out in support of impeachment only after talking to his constituents.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): Up until I came home this weekend I had resisted moving forward. But you know, I represent this district and I listen to the people and I heard them. It didn`t matter whether I was in the hole in the wall or the finest restaurant in my district, people would have come up and talked to me about this. And let me tell you, it bothers them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: First up next week, the Judiciary Committee will hear from legal experts and former U.S. attorneys on the findings of the Mueller report. They will also hear testimony from the former White House Counsel, not from Don McGahn who defied a subpoena to testify two weeks ago citing the President`s invocation of executive privilege. Instead, the committee will hear from Richard Nixon`s White House Counsel John Dean whose public testimony on the Watergate cover-up was a major turning point in that scandal.</p><p>These hearings represent a compromise of sorts between different factions of the House Democratic caucus which disagree on strategy on the end on whether to use the I-word as the president calls it. One thing there doesn`t seem to be a whole lot of disagreement on within that caucus is that the President deserves to be impeached whether or not it`s politically smart.</p><p>That his conduct as seen in public and the Mueller report already meets the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors, so much so that the number three House Democrat now says impeachment proceedings are all but inevitable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLYBURN: We do believe that if we sufficiently, effectively educate the public, then we will have done our jobs and we can move on an impeachment vote.</p><p>JAMES TAPPER, HOST, CNN: But it sounds like you`re -- you think that the president will be impeached or at least proceedings will begin in the House at some point but just not right now.</p><p>CLYBURN: Yes, exactly what I feel. I think we`ve already begun it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: I`m joined now by a member of the House Judiciary Committee who supports starting an impeachment inquiry Congressman David Cicilline Democrat from Rhode Island. Congressman, tell me what this hearing a week from today is designed to do?</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Well, Chris, it`s designed to provide some context with respect to the Mueller report. We`ll hear from legal scholars, one -- several of the nearly thousand U.S. attorneys who have signed a letter that said the conduct of the president would amount to obstruction of justice and he would be charged if you were not the president.</p><p>We`ll hear from John Dean who knows something about cover-ups and the way a corrupt administration operates. But your kind of lead-in suggest there`s big divisions in the caucus. I would really say to you that the Democratic caucus is unified on two critical points. One is that we must hold this president accountable, that no one is above the law, that the president cannot continue to cover up and prevent us from getting to the truth.</p><p>And secondly, that in addition to holding him accountable that we need to continue to deliver on the important priorities the American people elected us to focus on. Driving down the cost of health care, taking on the high cost of prescription drugs, rebuilding the infrastructure of our country, raising family incomes, and taking on the corruption in Washington.</p><p>We`ve passed over 100 pieces of legislation consistent with that agenda that will improve people`s lives. You`ve got to continue to do that. But the American people also expect us to hold this administration accountable. And there`s some disagreement in the caucus about the vehicle, the best vehicle to use but the hearings on Monday will be the beginning of our consideration of the contents of the Mueller report.</p><p>It will help bring that report to life for the American people and explain the crimes that are alleged ten separate instances of obstruction of justice including efforts by the President to create false documents or encourage people to do that, to encourage people not to tell the truth. These are serious, serious allegations in the Mueller report.</p><p>HAYES: In terms of holding the president accountable, there`s also this question of who you can get before your committee. Obviously, Don McGahn, Bill Barr have both defied your subpoenas. I see that there`s going to be a vote on Tuesday for contempt it appears for both of those individuals. How do you see where things stand vis a vis the kind of obstruction of Congress that the executive has doubled down on?</p><p>CICILLINE: Well, I think there`s no question that all the members of the committee and all the members of the Democratic caucus believe that critical that we have the ability to get witnesses and get documents that we need to conduct our investigations. If we allow the executive branch to simply deny us witnesses or deny documents, the executive branch will be allowed to extinguish congressional oversight.</p><p>That cannot happen. People cannot defy lawfully issued subpoenas so we`re really running on two tracks. We`ll begin these hearings, a series of hearings before the Judiciary Committee. At the same time we will move forward on contempt proceedings to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. That`s what the vote will be next week that will authorize a civil enforcement action.</p><p>But we really want to make it very clear that we intend to do our work, we intend to use the courts to enforce us subpoenas so we can get to the truth and that we can prevent the president from behaving as if he`s above the law and trying to keep this ongoing cover-up from continuing.</p><p>HAYES: I want to get your response to a little bit of reporting about the President and this has to do with something that you`re working on in your Subcommittee on the Antitrust. In 2017, the president repeatedly told aids such as Gary Cohn and Rob Porter, and John Kelly to try to block the AT&amp;TTime Warner merger. They didn`t listen.</p><p>His tweet today in which he suggested a boycott as part of a long campaign to punish a network whose coverage it. Am I`m wrong or that that in and of itself opens up the possibility of impeachment? Like using the antitrust powers of the executive to punish bad coverage, where does that stand in your mind?</p><p>CICILLINE: Yes. It`s a complete abuse of power. Look, the antitrust enforcement that is required by the Department of Justice is a quasi- judicial proceeding. It has to be free from any political interference. Those are judgments that have to be made based on the facts.</p><p>It`s completely improper for a president to attempt in any way to interfere. And the idea of using the power of the Department of Justice to punish people that he perceives are giving him bad coverage is a gross abuse of the office. And we`ll obviously be part of or conducting an investigation on with respect to the Antitrust Subcommittee of the whole issue of antitrust.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, you announced big efforts to look into big tech through that committee today. It`s very interesting stuff. I want to have you come back and talk to us about that as that perceives. Congressman David Cicilline, thank you very much.</p><p>CICILLINE: My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: For more on the first hearing on the Mueller report, I`m joined by Adam Jentleson former Deputy Chief of Staff and Strategic Adviser of Harry Reid when he was Democratic leader in the Senate and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman who served on the Judiciary Committee when it drafted articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon. She`s authored The Case for Impeaching Trump.</p><p>It`s interesting to me, it seems that they have the Venn diagram of the various parts of the caucus are like well, we should definitely have some hearings about what this guy is up to and that`s what we`re getting next week.</p><p>ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN: Right I think the real problem that the Democrats face -- well, people who care about democracy face is that the witnesses who could tell the story are not showing up. And how do you get them? The really critical thing is to get the story of the Mueller report to the American people. You can`t hand a report to a jury and say convict somebody. You`ve got to have live witnesses and that`s the problem here. The story of the Mueller report hasn`t been told to the American people.</p><p>HAYES: And it hasn`t been told in the first person by the people there, like for instance Don McGahn. I mean, John Dean, God bless him, but John Dean was -- he was there 30 years ago, 40 years ago, he wasn`t there now. Don McGahn sitting out there but they can`t get him to come before the committee.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: Right. And so what they trying to do is figure out how to do that and that`s a critical problem for them.</p><p>HAYES: Adam, you know, you`ve -- it`s been interesting to listen to you talk about this because you`re someone who has been an insider. I mean, you were -- you were in Senator Harry Reid`s office. You know that the view from inside looks very different. Sometimes the view from outside, sometimes I think properly so, and sometimes in a blinkered fashion.</p><p>I`m curious what you make of the strategy right now and particularly Pelosi his appearance before the California Democratic Party.</p><p>ADAM JENTLESON, FORMER SENIOR AIDE, MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID: Well, you know, I mean Speaker Pelosi has to bring the caucus along. I mean, that`s just a fact. You can`t just come out and announce that she favors impeachment if the caucus isn`t there.</p><p>But I think one of the things that was interesting about her appearance was that you know, she laid out the case for essentially why the president deserved to be impeached without saying he deserved to be impeached. And that`s sort of one of the things they`re dealing with here is that you know, if they lay out the sort of bill of particulars against the president, the automatic reflex question is well so doesn`t he deserve to be impeached.</p><p>It`s very hard to make the substantive case that this line they`re trying to walk right now of trying to make the substantive case against him without saying the I-word tricky because they have the power to do it and it and it just you know begs the question why they don`t use the power.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. There`s this sort of semantic wrinkle here. I mean, when I saw -- when I saw them noticing the hearing and the title is a presidential structure and other crimes, it`s like well, they`re crimes. Like crimes mean crimes. If you`re caught on crimes then that`s kind of the territory we`re in.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: Right. Well, you don`t need a crime to be impeached. And I think, you know, they have to be really careful about the language they use. I would have said obstruction of justice and other abuses of power, because I think you fall into a trap that the American people expect that you can prove that he committed a crime.</p><p>HAYES: Right. And abuse of power, you know, this -- Adam, this little blip right, this just passed today. It`ll get a little bit of nose. The president tells his advisers go block this murderer because I don`t like the way the company is reporting on me. It`s the perfect Trump example because it`s obviously to me, it`s an obvious abuse of power. I think it meets the threshold for high crimes and misdemeanors but they all just ignore him.</p><p>I mean, time and time again, the guy tries to commit masses abuses of power and fails in doing so because so many people around him are like just wait, wait the guy out. You can`t trust him. And that`s I think part of the problem the Democrats have.</p><p>JENTLESON: Right. Well, that`s right. And except for the fact that as of January 1st, 2019 they have the power to do something about it.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>JENTLESON: And I think you know, Trump got used to two years of being in control of the White House with a compliant Republican Congress where nobody was doing anything about it and he got in that habit. And Democrats I think in some ways got used to the fact that it feels powerless because the media would eventually move on and the story eventually moves on, but they have the power now.</p><p>And they have the power for the first time to actually do something about these abuses of power and it really is incumbent on them to do it.</p><p>HAYES: I want to play you something -- you know, we`ve been watching the sort of presidential candidates react to this and Mayor Pete Buttigieg was on Town Hall right before our hour, really fascinating. This is him in Chris Matthews talking about this question of impeachment. He comes right out and says what he would do. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: So I do recognize that while we`re still trying to get information, the investigations are ongoing, there are witnesses yet to come before Congress, that there may be some strategic wisdom in following that sequence. I`ll leave that to Congress.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I`ve got a follow-up and it`s to sort of nail you down. If you were voting in Congress right now on impeachment, would you vote to impeach?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I would.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Its hard -- to Adam`s point, right. I mean, that`s -- the problem is when you lay out you say look, I think the guy is abusing power and he`s committed -- he`s abused the office, you know, you end up in tails into something.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: Right. Well, look, there are a lot of parallels with Nixon. That`s what I write about in my book. The dangling pardon, says what Nixon was Nixon was impeached for, firing the special prosecutor. That`s what Nixon was impeached for.</p><p>HAYES: Right. But Nixon -- but Nixon succeeded in do it and Trump didn`t. I mean so many of --</p><p>HOLTZMAN: And he did. Trump did fired the special prosecutor -- I`m sorry, he fired Comey.</p><p>HAYES: Right. He fired Comey.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: And he tried to fire --</p><p>HAYES: But then he tried to basically end his own presidency by firing Mueller and Don McGahn wouldn`t let him do it.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: Right. But in the end, Nixon didn`t succeed in undermining our government.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: And neither will this president. So there`s plenty out there. The question is how do you bring the American people long. Mueller sets out part of the case and it`s critical to bring the American people along, educate them. And that`s what happened in Watergate. Let`s follow that blueprint.</p><p>HAYES: Final thing, Adam. You know, we`re going to -- our next segment is about some of the legislation that`s sitting on Mitch McConnell`s desk. And it`s true this House has done a tremendous amount in terms of passing a lot of stuff whether you agree with legislation or not. But I think you know, you saw Cicilline talking about two tracks. There`s this idea that like, the domestic legislation passed the House can be the kind of message for Democrats and I wonder what you think of that.</p><p>JENTLESON: Yes, I mean, you know, the House Democrats are proud of the fact that they ran on health care in 2018 and that`s very important. But there`s a difference now which is that in 2017 and 2018, the prospect of Republicans taking away people`s health care, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was a live possibility that drove a constant flood of news out of Washington so that buoyed Democrats message.</p><p>You can`t drive news just by passing bills. Even though these bills are good and right and important, the press knows that they`re just going to die in the Senate. And even if they didn`t, President Trump would never sign them so you can`t drive a national message in this saturated environment we have right now by passing those kinds of bills.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, that -- I think that`s well said. Adam Jentleson and Liz Holtzman, good to have you both on.</p><p>HOLTZMAN: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Next, Mitch McConnell is holding the Senate hostage refusing to hold votes on countless bills passed out of the Democratically controlled House. Senator Chris Murphy on the standstill Senate in two minutes.</p><p>TRUMP: People want the Democrats to pass immigration laws. They want the Democrats very importantly to do something on infrastructure. They want the Democrats to reduce drug pricing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Donald Trump has been complaining about a so-called persecution in the hands of the Democrats for months and he`s repeatedly claimed that Congressional Democrats are getting nothing done as a result but that`s just plainly factually incorrect. For example, Republicans have been the ones to block repeatedly a desperately needed disaster aid package. That bill finally passed the House today after they all came back from recess and overrode Republican objections.</p><p>But that`s far from the only example particularly in the Senate where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stalled bill after bill after bill. And that includes the For the People Act on voting rights and anti- corruption which would make it easier to register to vote and reform campaign financing and redistricting.</p><p>The Equality Act which the House passed. It would ban discrimination by sexual orientation as well as by gender identity. They`ve also passed a non-binding resolution to release the full Mueller report, The Violence Against Women Act, and coming up now on 100 days since passage by the House background checks for gun sales.</p><p>Those were all bills the Senate could have taken up, could take up right now but have not to the frustration of even some Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): We need to do more. By we, I mean the United States Congress. Other than nominations which are important and I will come back to that, we have done nothing, zero, zilch, nada.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Here with me now Member of the Senate Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Senator, do you agree with your colleague there?</p><p>SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Yes. You know, there`s empirical data to prove it. We have done nothing this year. This week we took two votes this evening and we will take a few more tomorrow and we`ll wrap up our business on Wednesday and leave for the week after having worked for a grand total of three days.</p><p>The idea that we`re doing nothing is I think one complaint shared by Republicans and Democrats. You know, as much as McConnell or President Trump can complain about the details of the legislation they might object to coming out of the House of Representatives, what`s so offensive to me and a handful of other Republicans is they`re not -- we`re not even trying to come up with alternatives in the Senate.</p><p>The Republican-controlled Senate could call up a debate on election security, could call up a debate on healthcare, could call up a debate on immigration. We could come to our own conclusion in the Senate and then we could try to reconcile that with the version come out of the House of Representatives but what is really difficult to swallow for those of us that work so hard to get to the United States Senate is that we`re not even trying to do our job any longer. We come in and cast a few votes on nominations and then go home on Thursdays.</p><p>HAYES: It`s really wild. I mean, having covered Capitol Hill before -- and this is I think in some ways the extension of certain trends that predate this moment, but you know you go there and people find little things they could get bipartisan cooperation on the election security where you could put together bipartisan majority. And McConnell what is -- is McConnell story he just doesn`t want anyone to take a hard vote on anything. I don`t even get. What is his theory of the case here?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. It`s hard to figure out. I mean that certainly is one theory which is that you know, this cycle he has more incumbent Republican senators that are up for election than Democrats and so why put any of them out on a limb. I think part of it is that you know, when you have no idea what the President is going to say on a daily basis, it does get kind of hard to run a legislative agenda.</p><p>Because on Tuesday you could put up a bill that the president says he`s going to sign and by Wednesday morning he`s openly eviscerating you on Twitter over it. And so I think there`s just a bit of -- you know, they`re scared of what the president is going to do on a day to day basis on legislation.</p><p>HAYES: I mean, you`ve got -- you`ve got -- I just want to focus for a second on something that you`ve worked your entire career on which is gun safety legislation. Obviously on the wake of the murder of 11 people in Virginia Tech using firearm -- I`m sorry, in Virginia Beach using a firearm. I`ve (INAUDIBLE) slip. I talked about a previous massacre that was used with a firearm.</p><p>There are two gun control bills that have come out of the House which I suspect would get close to 50 votes or 51 votes maybe in the Senate. I wonder what you think about those to use legislation in a fantasy world in which Mitch McConnell brought them up.</p><p>MURPHY: So, unfortunately, I think that the background checks bill exists in our first theory of the case which is that Mitch McConnell knows that he could lose his majority over the issue of background checks. He knows that this is now a critical vote for swing voters in this country. And so he doesn`t want to put so many of his Republican members in a position where they would have to choose between their voters and the NRA.</p><p>It`s sad to say but that`s what he doesn`t want to do. But there is you know, legislation out there that could get a pretty big bipartisan majority in the Senate. If you put legislation on extreme risk protection orders which is this idea that you can go to court to take weapons away from someone who clearly presents a threat to themselves or others.</p><p>That legislation could probably get 60 votes in the Senate and could get you know, 80 percent of the House of Representatives supporting it, and even that doesn`t feel like it`s coming before the Senate anytime soon.</p><p>So you know there are -- there are the tough votes for Republicans and then there are easier to votes for Republicans on the issue of gun safety, and McConnell doesn`t seem to be plowing a path for it on any of it.</p><p>HAYES: Final question. There was a vote today on a budget that was proposed I believe by Rand Paul. This is essentially a symbolic document but there`s a real recorded vote on it, 22-year colleagues. Senate Republicans voted for it which would involve massive almost sort of incomprehensible cuts to the basics of the American social welfare state and social safety net including Medicare, Medicaid, snap, national institutes of health. I think everything would get cut by half basically if the math is right. Like what was up with that?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. Well, I mean listen, give Rand Paul points for consistency.</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: He`s made it very clear that he believes in a government that doesn`t provide any notion of a basic safety net for you know, poor people or disabled people, or senior citizens, and he continues that crusade on a regular basis. He found a fairly obscure parliamentary point of order whereby he could present his vision of a budget before the Congress today. It got a handful of votes.</p><p>But in an era where you know, his leadership in the Senate has no responsibility for consistency of views, Mitch McConnell`s position on nominating judges in election years at the top of the list. At least Rand Paul brings consistency to his job.</p><p>HAYES: That`s right. Yes, a transparent outlining of an actual vision that people could be for or against. Senator Chris Murphy --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. Ideas are largely lost in the Republican Party today but Rand Paul still has a few of them albeit very bad ones.</p><p>HAYES: All right, Senator, thank you so much for sharing your time tonight.</p><p>MURPHY: Thanks.</p><p>HAYES: Next, he is the Democratic candidate for president who speech was nearly booed off the stage in front of California Democrats. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper tells me what happened next.</p><p>HAYES: This weekend, the largest single gathering of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates yet, a total of 14 in all hit the stage for the California Democratic Party convention to speak before a crowd that is part of the most engaged activist base that the party has to offer. And so with that in mind, perhaps it wasn`t much of a surprise when former Maryland Congressman John Delaney got booed for calling Medicare for all bad policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DELANEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But we need as Democrats to build an economy that works but it`s got to be with smart policies. Medicare for all may sound good but it`s actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I`m telling you -- I`m telling you --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Those boos went on for a full minute. Then there was former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper who not only criticized Medicare for all but also the Green New Deal and Socialism all in a matter of minutes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big Progressive goals, Socialism is not the answer. I was reelected -- I was reelected in a purple state in 2014, one of the worst years for Democrats in a quarter century.</p><p>We shouldn`t try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from over 150 million Americans. We should not try to tackle climate change by guaranteeing every American a government job. Hold on, hold on. As the Democratic Party, we have to create a vision for this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And John Hickenlooper, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, former governor of Colorado, joins me now.</p><p>Governor, was that what you were expected, or was that what you were seeking in that moment?</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: No, we were aware that we might get some boos. Certainly, I wasn`t planning on it.</p><p>HAYES: Let me ask you this, it was interesting, so you talked about that, about socialism, and then you talked about yourself, your sort of political bona fides, right, that you`d been elected in 2014, a tough year for Democrats in a purple state.</p><p>When you talk about these issues, do you see this in sort of practical terms that the electorate isn`t there with us or in substantive terms that these are bad ideas?</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: No, no, I`m running for president because I think this country is in a national crisis of division and Trump is fueling it and it`s taking the country backwards, but socialism isn`t the answer. What we did in Colorado, we got nonprofits and business, we got Democrats and Republicans, to get to almost universal health care coverage. We became the number one economy in the country. And we beat the NRA with some tough new gun laws, right?</p><p>As a governor but also as a small business person, I brought people together to get the big progressive things done that people said couldn`t be done.</p><p>HAYES: I guess when people talk about bringing people together, right, the question I always ask is, like, what sort of magic do you have, or what trick have you figured out that everyone else hasn`t, right? Barack Obama, I think everyone agrees, is whether they liked him substantively or not, one of the most talented politicians in recent memory, had a huge mandate, had huge majorities, right? And Mitch McConnell basically did everything he could to obstruct him.</p><p>Like in what universe does John Hickenlooper not encounter the same problem?</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think that in part it`s who I am. You know, I`m the one person running for president that never run for student council in high school or college.</p><p>HAYES: Wait a second, do you really think like your personality is such that Mitch McConnell is going to bring up stuff up to a vote because of who you are?</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: No, no, Mitch McConnell is the exception. And when we took on the NRA and they wouldn`t compromise...</p><p>HAYES: He`s a powerful exception. He controls one of the two legislative branches of the United States Congress.</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: I understand that. And you certainly have to go talk to him just so that the people that follow him and respect him wouldn`t feel diminished.</p><p>But in the end, you`ve got to do what you`ve got to do to get stuff done. And I think, you know, both as a small business person -- I spent 17 years as an entrepreneur and a small business person, you learn different skills of negotiation, and you build relationships in ways that other people don`t.</p><p>Look at Tip O`Neill and Ronald Reagan, they hated each other at first, right? They were at each other`s throats. And yet in the end, over a period of time, they came to know each other and they got big things done.</p><p>HAYES: Right. But Tip O`Neill and Ronald Reagan -- and my colleague in the (inaudible) wrote a whole book about this, it`s a very good book I`d recommend. You know, it`s just a different political era, right, the polarization of the two parties hasn`t settled in. You`ve still got southern Democrats who are sort of traditionally conservative. There`s all sorts of structural things in 30 years that have changed. And I think the argument that people on the other side of this sort of debate have, right, is that if you go into these structurally polarized politics thinking with a 1983 model you`re going to get the floor wiped with you.</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: I`m not using that model, I`m using the model of human nature. And when I ran for mayor in 2003, the suburban mayors were mostly Republicans and they hated the city of Denver. If you look at what we got done, we got all 34 mayors to unanimously support a tax increase to build the largest transit initiative in modern American history. And we did it collaboratively. You fly in DIA now, our airport, and you`ll take a train downtown to Union Station, you`ll see one of the national models of urban revitalization, that was through collaborative effort.</p><p>And it didn`t just happen overnight. My predecessor hated the mayor of the largest suburb, Aurora, and Aurora hated Denver. In the end, we got people to work together, and that`s how when I got elected governor, I was the first Denver mayor in 120 years to get elected governor of Colorado. That should say something.</p><p>HAYES: I want to ask you one more question about your record because you did mention the Green New Deal and you`ve talked about climate as well. One of the things that happened while you were governor of Colorado is that fossil fuel extraction went up tremendously. It was a boon, financial, to many of the fossil fuel companies. But I think you basically saw from 2.7 million barrels up to 14 million barrels. I know a lot of that was fracking.</p><p>When you look at that chart, when people who are really concerned about the climate crisis and say we need to get to net zero by 2050, look at that chart, isn`t that chart moving in exactly the opposite direction?</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: You know, what we did in Colorado, which had never been done in any other state, is we got the oil and gas industry to sit down with the environmental community. And if you look at it, we were the first state they got methane regulations. Methane is 25 to 40 times worse for the climate than CO2. And in the end the oil and gas industry agreed to pay $60 million a year, it`s the equivalent of removing 320,000 automobiles a year from the roads, that no one had ever done that, not in this country as far as I can tell. No other government had done that.</p><p>And yet if we`re going to deal with climate change, we`ve got to address methane and we`ve got to get everybody at the table and figure out some compromises or else we`re just yelling at each other.</p><p>HAYES: All right, John Hickenlooper, who is the governor of Colorado, 2020 presidential Democratic candidate, thanks so much for making time.</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: You bet.</p><p>HAYES: And I`m going to be talking with another 2020 candidate this coming Wednesday. We`re heading straight into the heart of Trump country for a live town hall with presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a red county in a red state, as Warren tries to prove she is the candidate who can turn the Rust Belt blue.</p><p>Again, it will be live this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC. I`m very excited for it.</p><p>Still to come, Jennifer Rubin on her take aways from the jaw-dropping interview with Jared Kushner. And tonight`s Tonight One, Thing Two starts next.</p><p>HAYES: Thing One tonight, a pastor in Virginia is apologizing to his congregation tonight after he prayed for a man dressed in shabby clothes who had wandered into his church yesterday. The problem is the man is the president of the United States.</p><p>See, it all began when evangelical leader Franklin Graham called for a national day of prayer for the president and got more than 300 fellow conservative Christian leaders to sign on and participate.</p><p>Trump had been retweeting Graham all weekend, but obviously wasn`t going to be going to church on a golf day.</p><p>But after 18 holes at Trump National in Sterling, Virginia, he threw the clubs in the trunk, hopped in the motorcade and apparently, as David Waldman suggested on Twitter, Google maps the closest church on the way home.</p><p>Trump then walked into that church, clearly unshowered and wearing a blazer over his golf clothes. You can can see he`s still got the golf shoes on and his golf hat, which he remembered to remove after he was already on stage. And that revealed the newest Trump hairstyle, 18-hole hat head.</p><p>A White House spokesman said the Trump made the unplanned stop at McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Virginia to, quote, \"visit with the pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach in the wake of the mass shooting there on Friday.\"</p><p>But Pastor David Platt said in a statement tonight that he got a call out of the blue that the president was on his way to the church and wanted them to pray for him. There was no mention of the Virginia Beach shooting at any point in the president`s 15-minute visit.</p><p>Pastor Platt has now apologized to his congregation for leading the prayer for Trump saying his aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies or his party. If you`re looking for a pastor who will do all those things, oh, do we have the guy for you. And he`s Thing Two in 60 seconds.</p><p>HAYES: Pastor Kenneth Copeland and a televangelist who runs a ministry based in Tarrant County, Texas, who is a member of President Trump`s evangelical advisory board and he`s used his TV platform to preach for Trump for years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNETH COPELAND, TELEVANGELIST: You`re going to be held seriously, seriously to account by god if you don`t vote. I mean, we could have another eight years of Hillary Clinton and the worst mess that anybody could make out of a nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Like many big time televangelists, Kenneth Copeland has used his position to live a pretty cushy lifestyle, and for some reason he has four, yes, four private jets -- one, two, three, four. A bit of scrutiny about that and when a reporter from Inside Edition caught up to ask him about it, well, hold on tight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn`t it true that you want to fly commercial so that you can fly in luxury? How much money did you pay for Tyler Perry`s Gulfstream jet, for example?</p><p>COPELAND: Well, for example, that`s really none of your business, but...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn`t it the business of your donors?</p><p>COPELAND: Listen, I paid -- you kind of caught me off guard here, OK? Thank you, lord, help me -- let me pray just a second.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, let me ask you a really simple question, a lot of people think it`s unbecoming for a preacher to live a life of luxury and to fly around in private jets, what`s your response to that?</p><p>COPELAND: Very simple, it takes a lot of money to do what we do. Without the airplane that we have that I bought from Tyler Perry, and I didn`t pay anywhere -- Tyler`s one of the greatest guys. He made it -- he made that airplane so cheap for me, I couldn`t help but buy it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, my question then -- Well, OK, all right, but I want to get to the demons, because people are very concerned about that comments.</p><p>COPELAND: Give me a chance here, Inside Edition. I love your eyes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Again, getting back to the comment. You said that you don`t like to fly commercial because you don`t want to get into a tube with a bunch of demons. Do you really believe that human beings are demons?</p><p>COPELAND: No, I do not. And don`t you ever say I did. We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but principalities and powers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Exclusive reporting tonight from our own Jacob Soboroff, as a court-ordered deadline to reunify migrant children with their parents approached last summer, 37 kids ages 5 to 12 who were meant to be meeting their parents again were instead left stranded in vans for anywhere from 11 to 39 hours because the ICE facility holding their parents wasn`t ready for their reunification.</p><p>MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff, who just broke this exclusive story along with Julia Ainsley, joins me now.</p><p>Jacob, this is wild and awful stuff. What happened here?</p><p>JACOB SOBOROFF, MSNBC: Yeah, it`s beyond awful, Chris. And, you know, there was that refrain over and over again during the separations and then again once the court-ordered reunifications were supposed to start taking place, where are the children, particularly the tender aged children? And now we know at least where these 37 children were when they were supposed to be in the process of being reunified with their parents they were sitting in a parking lot in a white passenger van, six to eight kids, crammed into each van, for as you said, up to 39 hours.</p><p>And the reason is Port Isabelle, the ICE adult-only processing center that was supposed to take them in and reunite them with their parents just wasn`t ready. They weren`t ready despite the fact that HHS called and gave them the heads up twice before these kids were brought over. And the idea that the first child was able to get off this van and see their parents after waiting 11 hours is -- it is hard to believe, but I feel like we`ve said that way too many times about this man-made separation crisis.</p><p>HAYES: You`ve managed to get your hands on some internal emails that are basically the contractor who is working with the government and watching over the kids flipping out over what`s going on.</p><p>SOBOROFF: It`s completely inappropriate in the eyes of the people that are supposed to take care of these kids. When I was on the air with you from that Brownsville shelter, the HHS shelter, the former Walmart that held over 1,000 young boys ages 10 to 17, I to you at the time these are people that are tasked with taking good care -- they`re licensed social workers of these separated children and they are in their care because of no fault of their own, it`s because the Trump administration systematically ripped them away from their parents.</p><p>So, this contractor, BCFS, it`s also the contractor that operated Tornillo and eventually advocated for shutting it down, wrote emails to Health and Human Services essentially saying this is unacceptable and we need to come up with a plan so that this does not happen again.</p><p>It was elevated all the way to Commander Jonathan White, who was the man in charge of spear heading the reunifications for HHS who basically said -- confirmed the anger that we could see in these BCF emails. He said you did the right thing by raising this and HHS called ICE in the middle of the night in order to get these kids ultimately reunified, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: All right, MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff with some more great reporting. Thank you very much.</p><p>SOBOROFF: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Next, a rare interview with one of the most powerful people in the country. And it`s bad, I mean real bad. The best moments from the Kushner interview next.</p><p>HAYES: Jared Kushner is literally one of the most powerful people in America and indeed the world I think you can say. Yet despite conflicts of interest so intense he was repeatedly denied security clearances until his father-in-law directly intervened on his behalf, Kushner basically never has to answer for his many egregious failures in his many White House jobs.</p><p>And after this latest interview with Axios, you can see why they keep him away from the cameras.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she calls -- she has called President Trump a racist. Have you ever seen him say or do anything that you would describe as racist or bigoted?</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: So the answer is no, absolutely not. You can`t not be a racist for 69 years, then run for president and be a racist. And what I`ll say is that when a lot of the Democrats call the president a racist, I think they`re doing a disservice to people who suffer because of real racism in this country.</p><p>SWAN: Was birtherism racist?</p><p>KUSHNER: Look, I wasn`t really involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: I know you weren`t. Was it racist?</p><p>KUSHNER: Like I said, I wasn`t involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: I know you weren`t. Was it racist?</p><p>KUSHNER: Look, I know who the president is, and I have not seen anything in him that is racist. So again, I was not involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: Did you wish he didn`t do that?</p><p>KUSHNER: Like I said, I was not involved in that. That was a long time ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now for more on the president`s son-in-law, Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post columnist and MSNBC contributor.</p><p>It`s amazing for someone who has as much influence and power as the man apparently does how little you ever get anything like this.</p><p>JENNIFER RUBIN, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yeah, I think there are two things that are confirmed by this. Number one, whoever said he should do this interview should be fired. Number two, it shows you that inherited wealth is often inversely related to intelligence and competence.</p><p>This man is a man who just rolled out a immigration plan that was pronounced dead on arrival before it got out of a room with Republicans. This is a man who rolled out a Middle East policy hat secretary of state told a room full of people who are sympathetic to the president this is not going to fly. So he has a perfect record.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah, this -- I want -- this part on the Middle East peace proposal I guess if you`re calling it that I thought was pretty remarkable. Jonathan Swan, who is the interviewer, does a very good job here. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SWAN: Do you believe that the Palestinians are capable of governing themselves without Israeli interference?</p><p>KUSHNER: I think that`s a very good question. I think that that`s one that we`ll have to see. The hope is that they over time can become capable.</p><p>SWAN: They being the Palestinians?</p><p>KUSHNER: The Palestinians.</p><p>SWAN: Do you understand why the Palestinians don`t trust you?</p><p>KUSHNER: Look, I`m not here to be trusted. I`m here to...</p><p>SWAN: Well, you are, frankly. I mean, to look at it from their point of view, and you`re a businessman, you always look at things from their view. You`ve got three orthodox Jews on the negotiating team. Two of you have at different points funded settlements, Jewish settlements in the West Bank. You`ve got the actions you`ve taken so far moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. You`ve cut all aid to the Palestinians, including hospitals in East Jerusalem. And you`ve shut down the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington. I mean, can you not see why they might not want to talk to you and that they might not trust you?</p><p>KUSHNER: So, there`s a difference between the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian people, OK?</p><p>SWAN: And you think the Palestinians people would be OK with all those things that you guys have done?</p><p>KUSHNER: The actions we`ve taken were because America`s aid is not an entitlement, right. If we make certain decisions which we`re allowed to as a sovereign nation to respect the rights of another sovereign nation and we get criticized by that government, the response of this president is not to say, oh, let me give you more aid.</p><p>So, again, that was as a result of decisions taken by the Palestinian leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: I mean, this is the guy running this process.</p><p>RUBIN: Listen, there are those of us who didn`t think that the peace process was a process at all and this sort of confirms it. He`s certainly thrown dirt on it.</p><p>This man is an embarrassment to the United States, that he`s running around loose talking to foreign powers. And can you imagine what he`s saying behind closed doors if this is what he says on air when he knows the cameras are on? This really is embarrassing. And it just underscores the need to really abolish nepotism in the executive branch. It`s inexcusable he should have a position of authority.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah, it`s also -- I mean, there`s also the case that he lies again or apparently misdirects on this question of his security clearance. I want to play one more clip, which is to me the most egregious thing here is Khashoggi and the relationship between Kushner and the Saudi government, which hacked to death a columnist for The Washington Post. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SWAN: Saudi Arabia has admitted that Saudi agents strangled and dismembered Khashoggi -- Islam, Judaism, and Christianity value burying the dead. W ill you join Khashoggi`s fiancee in calling on the Saudi government to release his body to his family or identify where they`ve put the body parts so his loved ones might give him, if not a timely burial, at least a burial?</p><p>KUSHNER: Look, it`s a horrific thing that happened. And what we`ve done is we`ve called for full transparency. We`re working on an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.</p><p>SWAN: Should they return the body?</p><p>KUSHNER: Once we have all the facts then we`ll make policy determinations. But that will be up to the secretary of state to kind of push on our policy and we`ll do everything we can to try to bring transparency and accountability for what happened.</p><p>SWAN: I mean, with respect, the Senate has unanimously said Mohammed bin Salman ordered it. The CIA briefed members of the Senate who voted that way. I don`t know what the administration`s waiting for in terms of accountability.</p><p>KUSHNER: I believe that there`s a report that they`re working on. They`ve been doing an investigation. And when they have the facts of the investigation, then it will be up to the president to make a determination on what he wants to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: He murdered a columnist for an American newspaper.</p><p>RUBIN: Yes, he did. He dismembered him. He murdered him. He lied about the murder. And the president of the United States and this individual, his son-in-law, have lied about that again to the American people.</p><p>Understand also that Jared Kushner was giving Mohammed bin Salman advice, contrary to the notion that we`re trying to get to the bottom of, it he`s playing PR agent for the guy who hacked an American journalist. It really is galling.</p><p>And once again, I think he should be banished from office. And the people who are in charge of foreign policy in this administration are doing a bad enough job on their own without introducing Jared Kushner. So I think it would behoove all of them to put him behind closed doors and have him not make any more public statements.</p><p>As far as the Saudis go, we have not paid -- we have not forced them to pay any price. The congress has condemned this. The congress has voted. The White House is stalling. The White House lies. And this is just unacceptable. And I think the United States congress needs to consider further steps to make sure that our disapproval, to put it mildly, of the Saudis is felt.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah, it is remarkable. I mean, I come back to this time and again -- The America first campaign, the America first president, who is putting American interests behind the interests, quite frankly in front of all of us, of Mohammed bin Salman who runs the Saudi kingdom. Jennifer Rubin, thank you very much.</p><p>RUBIN: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: That is ALL IN for this evening. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now.</p><p>Good evening, Rachel.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

It`s really not hard to decipher the signals the president appears to be sending to his various numerous criminal associates. Michael Cohen has said his former boss speaks in code and we`ve seen the president do it. Heaping praise on his cronies who don`t \"brake\" while blasting the ones who cooperate with law enforcement calling them rats just like a mob boss.</p><p>Now we may be witnessing the president and his felonious campaign manager trading messages right in plain sight. After Paul Manafort was sentenced last night to 47 months behind bars years below the guidelines for his conviction on tax and bank fraud charges, his lawyer skated past all of that to make one essential point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, LAWYER OF PAUL MANAFORT: I think most importantly what you saw today is the same thing that we had said from day one. There`s absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved any collusion with any government official from Russia. Thank you everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: We talk a lot about how members of Trump world played to an audience of one and that statement is just about as perfect example as you can find House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff responded the statement by Paul Manafort`s lawyer after an already lenient sentence repeating the president`s mantra of no collusion was no accident. It was a deliberate appeal for a pardon one injustice must not follow another.</p><p>The lawyer`s statement would not be the first evidence that Manafort has been angling for a pardon. Attorneys for the special counsel presenting their case that Manafort breached his plea deal suggested to the court he may have lied to investigators concealing vital information from them to boost his chance of getting a pardon.</p><p>And if Manafort and his lawyer were trying to send a message but that statement last night, the President appeared to receive it loud and clear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. I think it`s been a very, very tough time for him. So I just want to tell you that his lawyer went out of his way actually to make a statement last night, no collusion with Russia. There was absolutely none.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: If Manafort broke his plea deal and lied to investigators in exchange for a pardon, that could land him and the President in some pretty hot water. Even the new Attorney General who views executive power extremely broadly based on the memo he sent the White House has been clear that such conduct would cross a line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY, VERMONT: Do you believe a President could lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipients promise to not incriminate him?</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: No, that would be a crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Meanwhile, after Michael Cohen the so-called rat told Congress that he never sought nor would accept a pardon from his boss, the president is now publicly contradicting him. And doing so, the president is raising more questions about what exactly they may have talked about in secret.</p><p>The President today tweeted this, get this, \"Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a capital P-pardon -- why a capital P, I don`t know. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied. Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon, I said no.</p><p>Wait, what? Now Cohen says that`s not true and then according to Cohen`s lawyer, before he decided to cooperate with prosecutors, Cohen directed his attorney at the time to explore the possibility of a pardon with the president`s legal team. Cohen`s current lawyer says the president and legal advisors had dangled the possibility of a pardon for a while.</p><p>But getting back to the President`s extraordinary statement today, if the President had a direct conversation with Michael Cohen about pardons, as he claims, that would raise a host of new questions about his intent, questions that go to the heart of the investigation into whether the President obstructed justice and is continuing to do so.</p><p>For instance, when did he talk to Cohen? Was it on the phone? Did they talk in person in a third location in secret? When did it happen right after the raids what exactly was said who actually raised the subject of pardons? According to the New York Times, federal prosecutors in New York have followed up with Cohen to ask for additional details about the pardon discussions.</p><p>And asked about his contacts with the President on Capitol Hill last week, Cohen testified at that particular topic his contacts with the president was off limits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ROGER KRISHNAMOORTHI (D), ILLINIOS: When was the last communication with President Trump or someone acting on his behalf?</p><p>COHEN: I don`t have the specific date but it was a while ago.</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: And what did he or his agent communicate to you?</p><p>COHEN: Unfortunately this topic is actually something that`s being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York and I`ve been asked by them not to discuss it not to talk about these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: To help understand the implications of all this Parton talk I`m joined by Carol Lam, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California and former Superior Court Judge in San Diego and Ian Bassin former Associate White House Counsel of President Barack Obama and Executive Director of the nonprofit protect democracy.</p><p>Carol, there seems to be sort of consensus, I think, even among the maximalists that despite whatever Article two powers are at a part and you can`t exchange them for favors as part of a conspiracy to cover up a crime, right? I mean, that that were agreed on pretty much?</p><p>CAROL LAM, FORMER SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE, SAN DIEGO: I think we`re all agreed on that, Chris. The problem is we`re in completely uncharted waters right? I mean, you know, the pardon authority has typically been used after somebody has been convicted of a crime when all the facts are known.</p><p>And here we have the opposite. We have -- we have the pardon discussion getting mixed in to investigative work going on you know, while hints are being thrown around about you know, on the one side people dangling the possibility of a pardon and on the other side people angling for the for the possibility of a pardon.</p><p>And that`s just -- that`s just unprecedented because there`s only one person in the United States who holds a pardon authority and that is the president.</p><p>HAYES: I keep coming back, Ian, into this code idea, right? I mean, you know, there`s a reason that organized criminal speaking code. And there`s a reason that often they can go for a very long time without being prosecuted. Those two things are related, right? I mean, saying to someone you know, I need another meal or whatever, and that means like go do some illegal act.</p><p>Is done specifically so that you apply deniability and you can`t help but feel like we`re watching in public these flags being sent back and forth.</p><p>IAN BASSIN, FORMER ASSOCIATE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I mean, the president is essentially treating pardons like some sort of reality show prize right? But this is not The Apprentice and the Founders did not intend the presidency to be a game show. And what the president needs to realize is that the pardon power is not unlimited, OK.</p><p>Think about this. Jimmy Carter came into office and pardoned all the Vietnam draft dodgers. Now, if he had pardoned all the white draft dodgers and none of the black draft dodgers, it would have violated the Equal Protection Clause. And the president is getting really up against the limits of the pardon power because if he`s going to use it to protect himself, he`s going to find that it doesn`t work.</p><p>HAYES: No, but here`s the problem. Here`s what I think this whole thing`s very effective, Carol. The dangling of it prospectively could do what he needs it to do without the ever granting it retroactively. Meaning, it`s the power that he holds in front of you and we know this guy if there`s one thing he`s good at, its screwing over someone in a deal and double-crossing them.</p><p>So the problem is here throughout this whole thing, we know Paul Manafort is acted in ways that make zero sense unless the guy is angling for a pardon.</p><p>BASSIN: And this is a reason why Congress should begin investigating the dangled pardons now. So Representative Adam Schiff introduced a bill this week to give the Congress immediate access to investigative materials related to a pardon that was issued. Our organization protect democracy has advocated that they should expand that bill to cover dangled pardons, and that Congress should be investigated now precisely for the reason you note, to block it as being a deterrent to people cooperating.</p><p>HAYES: But Carol, then the question is like what`s the dangle. Like this is this is the world were now in, right? Like a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, going on the air and saying I think Michael Cohen was treated roughly and I feel terrible for the guy and I don`t know. And then when they ask him about a pardon saying something like I`m not going to talk about that but he was treated terribly. Like that seems like you can get away with that.</p><p>LAM: Yes, it does seem like it`s hiding in plain sight here. And you know, the problem is that mob cases are very difficult to prosecute for exactly that reason, right? You know, there`s code and there`s winks and there`s nod, but then there are nods but I think that here everybody has got to tread very, very carefully and there may be signals being sent at a certain point if that is truly what`s going on here.</p><p>They`re going to be enough signals that some -- that everybody`s just going to say enough. That`s enough. But what does worry me is that the dangling does interfere with the fact-finding process. And that is what investigations are about. And that has never really you know, hit us quite the way it`s hitting us now.</p><p>And we should note successfully interfere if we - if this is in fact the Manafort`s motivation which is that in court yesterday the sentencing, the Mueller prosecutor said they didn`t get any useful information out of them that they didn`t already know. So the -- mission accomplished. I mean, let me just read this tweet because it`s so perfect, August 22nd, 2018.</p><p>I feel -- this is the president. I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12-year-old tax case among other things apply tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen and he refused to break, makeup stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a brave man.</p><p>BASSIN: If we think that Donald Trump`s interest is in justice or mercy for Paul Manafort, I`ve got a bridge to sell. Donald Trump`s interest is in Donald Trump security. And that`s why the thing I think we also need to be talking about is the oath that Donald Trump took to take care that the laws be faithfully executed because what he`s doing here is he`s acting in bad faith, trying to use his powers to protect himself. And when Congress looks into it this should be a central claim that they look at.</p><p>HAYES: Carol, I also think there are ton of factual questions about this conversation he now says having Michael Cohen which I don`t know if I believe it happened. The President lies about all things all the time everywhere. But here`s him responding to a question three weeks after the raid about a pardon for Michael Cohen. Watch how he responds. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?</p><p>TRUMP: I thank you very much. Stupid question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Oh, stupid question? Really Mr. President? Well, today, you said you had exactly that conversation, right?</p><p>LAM: Right. You know, there are a lot of as you said signals being sent here. I mean, look at the fact -- look at the lawsuit that Michael Cohen filed against a Trump Organization wanting them to pay his legal fees according to the lawsuit, according to an indemnification agreement that the Trump Organization signed to pay Michael Cohen`s legal fees.</p><p>But according to the complaint, the payment stopped as soon as Michael Cohen started cooperating with the federal government. So the signals are all over the place, right? If you`re with us, you`re with us, and if you`re not, you`re not.</p><p>HAYES: Carol Lam and Ian Bassin, thanks to you both. My next guest sits on two of the House committees that are investigating the President`s abuses of power Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee.</p><p>Michael Cohen says that his lawyer says he sort of inquired about a pardon early on that one was dangled. The president says he asked him specifically for one which would be in contravention of the testimony he gave you under oath on House Oversight Committee. Who do you believe?</p><p>REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D), MARYLAND: Well --</p><p>HAYES: I know it`s a tough one between those two.</p><p>RASKIN: Cohen`s lawyers appear to be suggesting that there was the possibility of a pardon being dangled or floated by the president and that doesn`t surprise me. I mean, all of the footage you were just showing was of you know, public tweets and statements he was making which were like little Valentine sent to Paul Manafort you know, so I don`t think anybody puts it past the President Trump to use the pardon power along with everything else in order to get leverage in the justice process.</p><p>I mean he`s been doing everything that he can to interfere with the Mueller investigation and to steer everybody away from investigating his ties with Russia and other countries and the oligarchs and so on.</p><p>HAYES: You know, it`s always the possibility -- there`s always a possibility of President did nothing wrong at all although I think even the publicly known facts make you question his judgment but that there`s nothing further hidden and he will be cleared ultimately because he didn`t. And there`s also the possibility that he did commit either illegal or wrongful acts that will ultimately be found out. How likely is that scenario and do you do stay up at night worrying about that?</p><p>RASKIN: Look the facts that we have now make it one thing very clear that we have a President of the United States who`s tried to turn the government of the United States and has succeeded in many ways into a money-making operation for himself, for his friends, his family, and then for other large business interests which have begun if they`ve not already succeeded in taking over the Department of Interior of Education of Labor and so on.</p><p>And you know that`s the big structural corruption underneath the level of personal and family corruption and business corruption for the Trump interest. But underneath that what we`ve get is a massive taking of power by the timber interests, and the oil interests, and the for-profit colleges. There`s a fox for every hen house in Washington and Donald Trump has made this principle of corruption the defining ethos of his administration.</p><p>HAYES: But that`s distinct from getting the bottom of what he did or didn`t do with respect to Russia and with respect to other interests on the factual basis. I mean, it doesn`t necessarily disagree with that right? It`s also distinct from what kind of congressional or constitutional remedies there are.</p><p>RASKIN: Right, and you know, this is what the hearings are about. This is what our investigations are about. I mean, look people have already shown up with documentary evidence when originally it was reported that the president was paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money to former mistresses in order to buy their silence.</p><p>The right wing all claim that this was a smear and it was fake news and so on. And then Michael Cohen shows up with the canceled checks written directly by Donald Trump and others and then they maintain a discreet and demure silence about the whole thing and then go on to deny the next scandal.</p><p>So look, I mean it`s hard to think that any of these allegations are just wholly concocted after all. Nobody believes that Donald Trump is out spending his time trying to figure out how to advance the public interest or the common good. He`s out there wheeling and dealing and bringing in all of the businesses that he think can support him for his reelection.</p><p>And the political deals he cuts, of course, are with the extreme right-wing religious group that Vice President Pence brings in and we know they`ll do anything they can to try to stifle women`s right to choose. But other than that it`s hard to think of a real public agenda they have either been selling everything off to the highest private bidder.</p><p>HAYES: Final question, and you know I think that people have successfully commuted certain communicated certain red lines to the president before, I think firing Mueller which he tried to do according to reporting, wasn`t unable to do because Don McGahn threatened to quit over it. I wonder if pardoning Manafort would be such a red line and are you confident that has been communicated to him?</p><p>RASKIN: Well, I hope somebody has told him that the founders of the Constitution were very clear that the pardon power is not unlimited. It cannot be used for corrupt purposes. It can`t be sold. You can`t go on eBay and say I`m going to offer a pardon whoever it gives me the most money. That would clearly be an impeachable offense. I mean that`s in a direct violation of what the Founders talked about and what our best understanding of the Constitution is.</p><p>You know, I hope we`ve maintained enough common sense to understand that the president cannot put everything up for sale.</p><p>HAYES: Congressman Jamie Raskin who is on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight, thank you so much.</p><p>RASKIN: My pleasure.</p><p>HAYES: There`s a big shake-up in the staffing of the Fox News White House. Next, New Yorker Jane Mayer on the departure of Bill Shine just days after her blockbuster reporting on the nexus of Trump and Fox News. She also has some late-breaking news about the reporter who says that Fox News killed the Stormy Daniels story right before the election. Jane Mayer joins me in two minutes.</p><p>HAYES: Bill Shine, Trump`s communications director is leaving the White House for a job in the President`s 2020 campaign as a senior advisor. The rather unexpected move comes amid reports that shine wasn`t good enough at shielding his boss from negative coverage. Poor guy.</p><p>According to the New York Times, the president frequently criticized him to other advisers saying at his own press coverage had not improved. New Yorkers Jane Mayer also reported as much in her piece this week describing the close ties between the Trump White House and Fox News.</p><p>Mayer reminded readers that Shine, the former Fox News Executive was allegedly responsible for helping clean up sexual abuse at the network extensively noting several lawsuits name Shine is a complicit in a workplace culture of cover-ups, payoffs, and victim intimidation. Mayer also reported on Shine`s job interview with Trump.</p><p>Two months after Shine left Fox, Sean Hannity became a matchmaker arranging a dinner with the President at the White House. Hannity proposed shine as a top communications official or even as a deputy chief of staff. A year later, Shine was both and now he`s out. Jane Mayer joins me now.</p><p>First, let`s just start with this rather abrupt move as someone who`s been working this beat very closely. What was your reaction to it?</p><p>JANE MAYER, STAFF WRITER, NEW YORKER: Well, I guess I thought that probably Shine had just become too much baggage. I mean what he said himself in a meeting at the White House today to colleagues was that he`d become a distraction. He -- it was almost too obvious. He`d been the president -- a co-president of Fox News and he was now the Director of Communications in the White House. It just made the tie between Fox and the White House so heavy-handed that it became a you know, a lightning rod for critics.</p><p>HAYES: You know, the White House said they never know when the White House read your article which I find preposterous and hard to believe. But do you think the article played a role in the timing?</p><p>MAYER: Well, I don`t know why he`d be a distraction this week and not last week, but who knows, you know. I mean, it would be speculation on my part. I do know that Bill Shine was planning some long-term improvements in terms of what he wanted to do with the press office so it seemed as if he didn`t himself expect to be leaving anytime soon.</p><p>But it`s also true that he had bothered -- I think that President Trump had felt dissatisfied with him. He did not go on the trip to Vietnam with the President and he had expected to go on it. So I think it`s a combination of various things but something brought it to a head and I don`t think we know the whole story yet.</p><p>HAYES: I want to ask you about some pushback in some of your reporting than happened today which had been playing out in an interesting fashion. One of the most explosive parts of your reporting in the New Yorker is that Fox News, the Web site killed a story by one of its reporters Diana Falzone about the existence of Stormy Daniels that she said that she had a relationship with the president and that they killed it, and that the editor who killed it a guy by the name of Ken LaCorte killed it saying forget it, kid. Rupert wants Trump elected.</p><p>Big deal, an explosive thing to say in the newsroom. LaCorte himself wrote an op-ed today I believe for (INAUDIBLE) and he made a number of contentions. One, that he killed the story because it wasn`t publishable, that the reporter didn`t have enough details, and seemed to imply that you never even spoke to him, and I`d like you to respond to that.</p><p>MAYER: Yes. Well, actually it`s not really push back because his denial and his contention that he killed it because it wasn`t ready is in my story. And I did speak --</p><p>HAYES: Yes, he say that that`s the claim.</p><p>MAYER: It`s actually -- his point of view is very much reflected in the story. He`s quoted four times from the story. I interviewed him extensively. That last bit about Falzone who was the author of that particular story we`re talking about he sent us a ton of material on. I went through his material and put in his you know, his statement.</p><p>So I think -- I mean I do understand why he feels embarrassed and wants to try to sort of reclaim his reputation because who wants to be the editor who killed the story about Stormy Daniels that turned out to be true and have a reporter who feels that it would have swayed the whole election if they just published it.</p><p>I mean, he`s got to think of something to say I suppose. But he had his say in our story and I`m glad he did. You know, we feel at New Yorker that we try to get everybody`s point of view and his is very much reflected.</p><p>HAYES: I just want to be clear because the most explosive part which is that a reporting that a colleague heard him say out loud this line that Rupert wants Trump elected. You`re confident in that reporting. You stand by that reporting.</p><p>MAYER: It`s -- I don`t think I have it quite exactly right. It`s not that she heard it said out loud. It`s that the reporter Diana Falzone confided in my colleague who I interviewed about it.</p><p>HAYES: I see. I see.</p><p>MAYER: And yes -- and I think that the record will show this if in fact the record is ever disclosed and in fact there`s a call tonight by the lawyer for Diana Falzone. She unfortunately is under a gag order. Fox will not allow her to speak because there`s a non-disclosure agreement with her.</p><p>She sued Fox for gender discrimination and there was a settlement out of court and she`s not allowed to speak about what happened to her at Fox and about her doing this story. But her lawyer tonight whose name is Nancy Erika Smith has put out a statement calling for Fox to lift that NDA and let her speak about this so the truth can come out. And I`d love for Fox to lift the NDA. I think that would be just great and we can see.</p><p>HAYES: I would like to read that statement because it`s quite remarkable. So this is a woman who is at the center of this with this explosive story that you`ve reported right? The idea that it was killed too politically benefit the president was essentially helping a cover-up. We know that cover-up also happened because of the hush money which is a federal crime as pleaded to by Michael Cohen. And the person at the center of it covered by an NDA because of a settlement with Fox News.</p><p>Her lawyer tonight saying, in light of the false and defamatory statements being made by Fox News agent Ken LaCorte and Fox News employee Howard Kurtz, Diana Falzone again, the reporter who you report found the Stormy Daniels story and had it squashed. As Fox News and specifically Rupert Murdoch to release her from her non-disclosure agreement on the topic of her reporting in October 2016 regarding Donald Trump paying hush money to Stormy Daniels because the public has a right to the truth. So I guess we will wait to hear from that.</p><p>Final question here. Do you think that Shine leaving changes anything about the fundamentally bizarre codependent relationship between this White House and Fox that you document in your story?</p><p>MAYER: You know, I don`t really think so because the relationships go so deep on so many layers all the way up between Rupert Murdoch who was the chairman of Fox and talks frequently to the President and to the President`s son-in-law Jared Kushner. To Sean Hannity who is the marquee talk show host at Fox who says -- he`s told colleagues, he speaks to the President after his shows in the evening. There`s so many different levels of communication and it`s such an open kind of feedback loop there. I don`t actually think that that`s going to change just because Bill Shrine is leaving.</p><p>HAYES: Sorry, final question. I lied. You`re -- the DNC announced I believe it was yesterday that they would not have Fox host any of the Democratic primary debates. And one of the things they did was cite the reporting in your article specifically about what happened with Diana Falzone according to your reporting. Your reaction of the fact that this article apparently led to that outcome.</p><p>MAYER: You know, I mean that`s really a political calculation what the DNC wants to do. It`s kind of a beyond my paygrade. I`m happy to talk about journalism and describe the reporting process that went into for instance the Falzone story where you know I interviewed a number of people and there were three corroborators for her story. But you know, I don`t -- I don`t really know. I mean the DNC has to make its own decisions about who it wants to deal with. It`s so not my deal.</p><p>HAYES: All right, Jane Mayer whose piece is out in this week`s New York Magazine has made a lot of waves. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MAYER: So great to be with you.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, 23 Republicans voted against condemning bigotry and hatred. That story next.</p><p>HAYES: It was an eventful week for the Democratic House majority. They had an intense internal caucus debate over comments by Congresswoman Ilahn Omar, who some people in the party found anti-Semitic, prompting a resolution rebuking anti-Semitism, which was then delayed and expanded to include other forms of bigotry, including bigotry against Muslims, something that Representative Omar has certainly faced.</p><p>In the end, Nancy Pelosi walked away with a completely unified Democratic caucus that voted unanimously yesterday to condemn different forms of hate. Plot twist, the only no votes were 23 Republicans who voted against the anti-hate resolution, plus -- and I love this detail -- Steve King, who just voted present. The same Steve King who was stripped of his committee assignments in January for asking \"white nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization, how did that language become offensive?\"</p><p>Yes, how did it become offensive?</p><p>And then today, another unified front with every single House Democrat voting for the first big piece of legislation to come out of the Democratic House.</p><p>Joining me now, Democratic Congressman Max Rose of New York, part of the bipartisan task force for combating anti-Semitism, an upset victory in the outer Burroughs of New York City, a place near and dear in my heart. Good to have you on.</p><p>REP. MAX ROSE, (D) NEW YORK: Well, it wasn`t an upset to me and my supporters, but thank you.</p><p>HAYES: You`re insulted.</p><p>ROSE: Thanks for calling me that -- yeah, well, what a way to start off a conversation.</p><p>HAYES: You beat an incumbent in a race that I don`t -- you know, a lot of people when they looked at first tier, top 10 races, top 20, you were definitely in a competitive race, but that was an uphill battle. You had an incumbent.</p><p>ROSE: Well, look, an incumbent -- a lot of people had an incumbent.</p><p>HAYES: Against -- in a Trump district.</p><p>ROSE: It`s not a Trump district, just like it`s not a Max Rose district. What it is is it`s a district, just like the rest of the country, votes for the person, not the party. This isn`t complicated stuff and we shouldn`t overly intellectualize it, I`m seriously. And I know that part of what we`re going to talk about today is what we accomplished today in the halls of congress, which was the boldest anti-corruption measure, the boldest pro-democracy measure ever put before congress. And we promise that when we ran from Michigan to California, Colorado, Florida, it didn`t matter, we were talking about putting congress back on the side of the working class and the middle class, and shocker we actually followed through on what we said we were going to do.</p><p>This wasn`t like repeal and replace where we didn`t actually have a planet.</p><p>HAYES: Well, you don`t have a law yet, let me just say, you don`t have -- I mean, you passed a bill out of a House.</p><p>ROSE: Sure, sure. We did our part. And now a very simple question is going to be put before Mitch McConnell. It`s very simple, whose side are you on? I actually think that question defines our politics today. It`s going to define 2020 as well. Mitch McConnell has to decide, because his party is running on draining the swamp. He supported a president who said I`m going to drain the swamp. I`m going to put government back on your side, get all the lobbyists out of your pockets. And now they`re not for H.R.1? They don`t even have a plan for anti-corruption. They don`t even have a plan for any of this. It`s shocking. It`s absolutely shocking.</p><p>HAYES: So, what`s -- I mean, there`s a bunch of stuff in H.R.1. Public financing of campaigns. There`s an automatic voter registration nationally, which would be a huge change. A lot of states are doing it -- New York is thinking about it, election day a national holiday. Why -- what, to you, is most important in this bill?</p><p>ROSE: Well, it`s viewed as a whole package, which is what I think is essential. The aim of the bill is to change politics in this country, because it seems like it doesn`t matter, we can`t get things done like lowering drug prices, generation`s long infrastructure bills, so many of the things that we have spoken about for so long. Part of the reason why is that the system is not on the people`s side.</p><p>We have to make it easier to vote, not harder. We certainly have to make it so it`s not just the rich that can run for office.</p><p>HAYES: I want to play you -- you know, this is remarkable. So, there are a lot of things in here trying to make it easier for people to vote, right. And Kevin McCarthy, I want to play his objection to this in which he cites what appears to be felonious malfeasance by a Republican campaign in North Carolina as a reason not to vote for the Democrat`s bill. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) CALIFORNIA: H.R.1 exposes our election system to widespread fraud. Take ballot harvesting, for example. We had one less member in this body because of harvesting of ballots. Can you imagine putting the trust of your votes in the hands of a stranger? If that doesn`t scare you, it should.</p><p>Sadly this practice was weaponized in California and North Carolina, not so long ago. But now we want to make it everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Don`t vote for the bill because in North Carolina congressional campaign hired a felon to commit fraud?</p><p>ROSE: Sure.</p><p>Look, this is rich. This is just rich. They do not have a plan. These folks have been running around the country -- because the American people are united, all right, they`re voting for Republicans when they say drain the swamp. They`re voting for Democrats when they talk about H.R.1 anti-corruption, everyone is voting for change.</p><p>But it seems that the Democratic Party is the only ones who have actually put forth a way in which we want to accomplish this and all they`re talking about is distractions. It doesn`t even matter which party they`re talking about.</p><p>I`m all about bipartisanship, I really am. But the American people want this. Let`s at least hear what they want to do. This shouldn`t be hard.</p><p>HAYES: I want to ask you about the other big resolution this week, the anti-hate resolution. You have a very diverse district. It`s an incredible district. It`s a patchwork of all sorts of people from all sorts of places. First question, were you someone who objected to them broadening it out from a resolution just about anti-Semitism to including other forms of bigotry, or were you happy that it broadened out and took the form it took.</p><p>ROSE: Let`s take a step back, first, OK. When I saw Ilhan`s comment, you know, as someone who is a Jewish army combat veteran, of course was offended. I don`t have multiple allegiances. My allegiance is to the United State of America. On the same hand, though, one should be in free in this country to criticize Israel, criticize Benjamin Netanyahu, just the only thing that we`re asking is say that. This should not be difficult.</p><p>On the same hand, though there is rising Islamaphobia in this country that is incredibly galling. I mean, we have direct threats being made against Ilhan herself. And so to come out and talk about both of those things I don`t think is the problem. What the problem is, though, is that we had 20 Republicans who couldn`t even meet that standard. I would like for you to the invite them on and seriously question them what issue did you have? I`m sure what issue did they have with this?</p><p>HAYES: Well, Brooks said that it was Christians and I think Caucasians, or just Christians were not protected from anti-bigotry.</p><p>ROSE: Oh, come on.</p><p>HAYES: You just said Ilhan -- are you friends with Ilahn Omar? Do you guys have a good relationship personally?</p><p>ROSE: Yeah, so look, we are certainly colleagues, and I`ve certainly worked to continue a working relationship with her here. That`s important.</p><p>Resolutions are easy. Resolutions are not hard. What`s important, though, is that we continue to quiet and diligent work to bridge coalitions, to have hard conversations on both sides, so we can make sure things like this do not happen anymore, because there is so much to unite around. And I think you saw some of that unity today around H.R.1.</p><p>HAYES: All right, Congressman Max Rose, great to have you here. Come back any time.</p><p>ROSE: Thanks.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, another bold progressive policy move by 2020 candidate, as Senator Elizabeth Warren announces her plan to take on big tech.</p><p>Plus, what it means to learn on the job when you`re president of the United States. That`s tonight`s Thing One, Thing Two, and it`s a good one. Starts next.</p><p>HAYES: Thing One tonight, earlier this week, we told you about a meeting at the White House on American workforce policy where a few really strange things happened. First, the president called his daughter and advisor, Ivanka, honey, in front of everybody and awkwardly sort of wrestled with her, then Trump tried praise Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and got a little confused about his name.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Tim, you`re expanding all over and doing things that I real a wanted you to right from the beginning. I used to say, Tim, you got to start doing it over here and you really have. I mean, you have really put a big investment in our country. We appreciate it very much, Tim Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: OK, if that wasn`t bad enough, Tim Cook, not Tim Apple, had to keep sitting there, nodding, listening to the president talk about how he discovered human trafficking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Human trafficking is a disaster. Nobody knew too much about it until recently. It`s been going on for a million years, actually. It`s been going on for a long time. But we`ve seen it, we`ve spotted it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Nobody knew anything about it until recently. It`s been going on for a million years.</p><p>It`s always amazing when Donald Trump learns a well known fact that everybody else already knows and tells you that you actually didn`t already. And boy does he do that a lot. It`s Thing Two in 60 seconds.</p><p>HAYES: We learned recently that Donald Trump threatened to sue his former schools if they ever let his grades or transcripts be made public. And it`s hard to imagine why he would be so concerned. I mean, it seems like he must have been such a great student. Just look at all the things he`s learned since running for president that nobody ever knew before.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: People don`t realize, you know, if you go back to the civil war it was the Republicans that really did the thing.</p><p>Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.</p><p>People don`t realize we are an unbelievably divided country.</p><p>People don`t know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world.</p><p>Denuclearization is a very important -- it`s a very important word -- become a very well used word and a lot of people don`t know what it means.</p><p>People don`t realize what a big country Mexico is.</p><p>A lot of people don`t realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican.</p><p>Most people don`t even know he was a Republican, right. Does anybody know? A lot of people don`t know that.</p><p>Veterans are America`s greatest national treasure. And a lot of people understand that, some people don`t.</p><p>You know, people don`t understand, I went to an Ivy League college. I was a nice student. I did very well. I`m a very intelligent person.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: The news of Paul Manafort`s just over four year sentence far below the federal sentencing guidelines, has prompted a lot of attention to the massive disparities to the U.S. criminal justice system. And how could it not?</p><p>When a woman last year was sentenced to five years in prison for voting illegally, because she was a felon on parole. Another woman, will spend eight years in prison, and potentially be deported, because she thought you could vote as a permanent legal resident.</p><p>Then there`s white collar crime in the same category of Manafort, the ex- mayor of Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick, was sentenced to 28 years for a series of corruption charges.</p><p>But one case that really gets me that I keep thinking about in the wake of that sentence is the case of Reality Winter. Winter worked as a linguist in the air force, and an intelligence contractor for the NSA. And she was so torn up about what she learned about Russian interference into the election, so determined to get the story out to the public, that she leaked a classified document on the subject to the publication The Intercept. And for this act of whistleblowing really, Reality Winter was given over five years in prison.</p><p>Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed ever in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media.</p><p>Now, Reality Winter did not spend her adult life involved in financial scams, or cheating the government, or lobbying for dictators, she leaked a classified report. She`s a veteran who served her country, which means the guy who actually met in a cigar bar with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political operative assessed to be linked to the Russian intelligence, and gave him 75 pages of Trump campaign polling for reasons unknown is right now going to serve less time than a veteran who leaked a document to blow the whistle on a Russian election interference.</p><p>HAYES: Another day, another big, bold new shoot the moon policy proposal from a Democratic presidential contender. This one comes from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has already proposed some big ideas, including a wealth tax and universal child care. Warren`s new proposal, laid out in a Medium post today and in a speech today in Queens, is to break up the big tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook on anti-trust grounds.</p><p>One of the issues Warren highlights, is that these companies concurrently sell products on platforms they also own. Earlier today on this network, speaking to Ari Melber, she explained why that`s a problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: What this is about is about is about competition, it`s about all those little businesses and startup businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon or on Google and who are at an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or on Google, if they like the money they see that you are making, because they get all the information, they decide to go into competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now for more on Warren`s big plan and the big proposals from Democratic presidential contenders, Democratic strategist Tera Dowdell, and Sam Biddle, technology reporter at The Intercept who has got a big column about this today.</p><p>Let me start with you, Sam, on the details of this. How big is this in the context of what we have seen from anti-trust enforcement?</p><p>SAM BIDDLE, THE INTERCEPT: I think the biggest we`ve ever seen. I -- it is a huge, huge, more than a warning shot, it is a we are coming after you, if I win, kind of warning, which is, you know, a warning with some caveats in it, but it`s a huge statement, and I think it is shaking a lot of people in Silicon Valley right now.</p><p>HAYES: It would actually mean breaking up these companies, right. I mean, she would actually reach into them and separate different parts of them.</p><p>BIDDLE: So far it sounds like most of it would be sort of undoing, reversing these merger and accusation deals that we`ve seen over the past few years.</p><p>For example, taking Instagram away from Facebook. Taking away...</p><p>TERA DOWDELL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: WhatsApp.</p><p>BIDDLE: Yeah, exactly, taking WhatsApp away from Facebook. So sort of making them -- pairing them down a little, but not splitting them up into a bunch of different pieces.</p><p>HAYES: Two things happening here that are interesting. One is the politics of seeing big tech as a threat, which I think is -- there is growing political momentum behind, and also just this sort of ideas primary we`re seeing the Democratic Party where people are really pushing the boundaries of what a Democratic agenda looks like.</p><p>DOWDELL: I think there is a thirst in the Democratic Party, and this is a manifestation of that, there say thirst in the Democratic Party for Democrats to be bold, unequivocal and unapologetic in terms of fighting for Democratic values.</p><p>I think what you`re seeing is voters are realizing, generally speaking, not just Democrats, but Democrats are professing it differently, all voters are realizing that something is not right, right. Like their incomes are still the same, but yet they`re working harder. We know productivity is up in this country, homeownership, if you`re African-American is lower now it was before in past years. And so I think voters are feeling that, and I think on the Democratic side, in particular, Democrats are pushing for the party to prioritize, working poor people, poor people, middle income people, small business owners, like myself, and that`s what you see. You see these bold ideas coming out as a response to that.</p><p>HAYES: These are some of the basic income for children, which has now become a sort of consensus Democratic position, breaking up big banks and tech firms here. Free college, the Green New Deal, legalizing marijuana, Medicare for all, paid family leave, universal child care, a wealth tax. I mean, those are -- that`s a very big agenda. I mean, those are from different candidates.</p><p>One of the advantages of this, though, is this doesn`t really need 60 votes in the Senate, right? I mean, this doesn`t need to go through legislation, this is the thing you can do as president.</p><p>BIDDLE: Well, so what Warren said in the post, and it`s worth noting this is just a blog post, right, she`s not talking legislation at the moment, this is all sort of 10,000 foot view, but she wants to, or said she would appoint regulators whose job it would be to monitor these big firms for infractions, the definitions of which are a little vague at the moment, but -- and also facilitate that spinning off process, that cutting Instagram away from Facebook, cutting Ways (ph) away Google, Nest away from Google, that pairing down process.</p><p>And that sounds like something she could do on her own more or less.</p><p>HAYES: That is something I also think that we will, I wonder if we`re going see that more in the primary.</p><p>You can talk about Green New Deal, Medicare for all, big legislative domestic priorities, but like, if Mitch McConnell is there and no one gets rid of the filibuster, whereas there are things you can do things in executive, anti-trust, or there`s some things you can do executive around marijuana enforcement. You wonder how much we`re going to see ideas that don`t necessarily depend on the congress.</p><p>DOWDELL: As someone who has worked in government, I can tell you that if you have a lot of discretion within a different agencies to write rules and protections and that is what you see. You see the Trump administration, for example, using those powers and unwinding those protections that were put in place under the Obama administration. So I think you will see more a savvier Democratic Party around making clear that they will use what powers they will use, exactly.</p><p>BIDDLE: It`s also been so long since we`ve seen an FTC that`s willing to take on business interests. The Trump FTC has been sort of asleep at the wheel, an aggressive FTC that would want to crack down on some of these things that Warren laid out would be shocking.</p><p>HAYES: That`s the amazing thing about this sort of revived anti-trust movement is that there is already regulatory bodies, statutory authority in place. The craziest thing is that it just has not been used in a particularly aggressive way in essentially 30 years, because of like a revolution in the way all this stuff was done.</p><p>DOWDELL: Well, I think the other thing that you see -- as a small business owner, I can tell you I experience this all the time and I see it, witness it, is you see when companies get big, the first thing they do is they increase the barriers of entry to keep people like me from getting into the process.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, and the story Elizabeth Warren told there is wild. Amazon will just sit there and be like, oh your plates look nice, we`re selling Amazon plates now. And that`s the first hit in the search.</p><p>Tera Dowdell and Sam Biddle, thank you both for being with me tonight.</p><p>That is ALL IN for this evening. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now with Joy Reid in for Rachel. Good evening, Joy.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

News from the Mueller investigation into Roger Stone on multiple fronts tonight. NBC News has exclusively obtained text messages between Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone and his friend Randy Credico showing once again Stones foreknowledge of those WikiLeaks e-mail dumps. Big news Wednesday, radio host Randy Credico wrote on October 1st, 2016 according to the text messages provided by Stone. Now pretend you don`t know me. You died five years ago, Stone replied. Great, Credico wrote back. Hillary`s campaign will die this week.</p><p>Six days later, WikiLeaks did release its first batch of e-mails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. And this was not the only Roger Stone news today. The Wall Street Journal reporting The Specials Counsel`s office is now looking into possible witness intimidation by Stone of that very witness Randi Credico, something that Stone denies. Now, Stone has already said he expects to be indicted went on Laura Ingraham`s radio show today to try once again to rewrite history.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>STONE: To date, there is no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or any proof or evidence that I knew in advance the source or the content of allegedly stolen or allegedly hacked e-mails published by WikiLeaks. Never predicted anything of the kind nor heard any such thing from Jerry Corsi who`s a great researcher and a writer and a friend of mine, so it`s a witch hunt.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Witch hunt. You get all that? He didn`t know what? He didn`t know \"in advanced the source or the content of stolen e-mails published by WikiLeaks.\" That is one should note quite different from not knowing it was coming. And those text provided by Stone to NBC News ostensibly to vindicate himself show that he knew it was coming. \"I think it`s on for tomorrow, Credico texted Stone on October 3rd, 2016. Later that day, Credico texted Stone asking, why can`t you get Trump to come out and say that he would give Julian Assange asylum, according to text obtained by NBC News?</p><p>Mueller`s investigation is still firing on many fronts. Today it was in court where prosecutors from the Special Counsel`s office said they were not ready to yet sentence Trump`s former Deputy Campaign Manager Rick Gates because he \"continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations.\" And this comes two days after Michael Cohen was in Washington to meet again with the Mueller team. It comes just one day after Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi who you heard him referred to there above, abruptly canceled an interview with NBC News. Corsi`s lawyer stopping Corsi from going forward with the interview here at 30 Rock while at the same time fielding a call from the office of the Special Counsel.</p><p>Of course, there`s an open question in this moment about just how much latitude Robert Mueller has to operate and follow the truth where it leads since he is now reporting, let`s remember, to this man Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker who today received a ruling from the office of legal counsel inside the Justice Department saying his appointment is lawful and valid. This despite the fact that the only time in American history that an attorney general was even remotely appointed in this way was back in 1866 and he held the position for six days. But Whitaker is not out of the woods yet.</p><p>House Democrats are preparing to investigate Whitaker`s role on the advisory board of a company accused of scamming millions from its customers. Congressman Adam Schiff of California Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee joins me now. Schiff and his Democratic colleagues sent letters requesting information on Whitaker`s involvement with that company`s advisory board. And let`s start there. Congressman Schiff, what are you asking for, what are your concerns about Whitaker?</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, our concerns are that at a time when he was a paid advisory board member, this company is alleged to have been engaged in criminal conduct. We`re talking about the chief law enforcement officer of the country. If he was aware of this criminal conduct or was implicated in any way, or failed to uphold his responsibility, that is something that we ought to know of the chief law enforcement officer of the country. And certainly, it raises another recusal issue there`s no way that he can or should be involved any of the aspects of that case given that he was -- has such a close tie to those involved.</p><p>HAYES: Is it your understanding -- that`s been publicly reported -- but is it your understanding as well that the FBI has an open criminal investigation into the activities of that very company?</p><p>SCHIFF: You know, I don`t know the answer to that. That`s not information generally that they share with the Congress.</p><p>HAYES: Let me ask you this. Maryland has filed a motion basically asking a court to declare Rod Rosenstein the real attorney general basically saying Whitaker, his appointment is unconstitutional. Do you agree with that argument or what remedies or courses of action do you want to see happen here?</p><p>SCHIFF: I do agree with that lawsuit and I think that his appointment does violate not only Constitution but other statutes as well. He is a principal officer. He`s the top law enforcement officer in the country. The fact that he is serving it for a temporary period doesn`t make him somehow inferior. We look at both the letter of the Constitution which requires that position be Senate confirmed, but we also look at the functionality that is if you interpret it the way the Justice Department is, what does that say about the function of that office by somebody who`s an Acting Attorney General as compared to with someone who`s a permanent Attorney General. And by that test, there`s no difference in the function. He has no greater, no lesser responsibilities than if he would the permanent Attorney General, they`re identical so it makes no sense to treat them differently.</p><p>And finally, and I think this is very persuasive and was also pointed out by the Maryland Attorney General, and that is we have a succession statute specifically for the Department of Justice. In other cases, with other agencies that have a succession statute, they specify when you can also use the Vacancy Reform Act. This statute does not do that and the strong implication is when Congress passed this statute and said this is the succession, it meant what it said and when you have conflict between a specific statute and a more general one, it`s the specific statute that governs.</p><p>HAYES: So there`s a situation right now, the special counsel`s office is doing its work. It now reports up to as far as we know Mr. Whittaker, the Acting Attorney General. There`s a question about what is happening in those interactions. What can you and the Democratic Party do once you gain control the gavel to find out what`s happening and ensure that there`s no untoward interference?</p><p>SCHIFF: Well, the first thing we can do is bring Mr. Whitaker before the Congress and I think that`s exactly what`s going to happen and we could demand answers in terms of what actions he`s taking in the investigation, what communications he`s had with the president, whether he sought an ethics opinion, what that ethics opinion told him to do, whether he is violating the terms of the ethics opinion.</p><p>Now, I would fully expect under some of these questions the White House is likely to fight us. But nonetheless we are going to persevere and the truth is going to come out. There`s just no way to avoid exposure if Mr. Whitaker does anything unethical. And we ought to expect everyone in the Justice Department to abide by the highest ethical standards and that includes particularly the Attorney General.</p><p>HAYES: There`s been some -- Benjamin Wittes wrote of piece to this extent the other day and I`ve seen other people make the case that essentially the Mueller investigation is far enough along that it will find what it will find that at this point there`s not that much and even a malevolent Acting Attorney General could do to stifle it. Is that your view?</p><p>SCHIFF: No, it is not my view at all. That presupposes really all the work has been done in the investigation or farmed out to other people who can carry it on. No, let`s remember that he can not only in this position interfere with what Bob Mueller is doing, he can interfere in what the Southern District of New York is doing. And to the degree that Bob Mueller has more work to do, let`s say that the Mueller team has decided it needs to subpoena the President to force him to testify, that`s something that can be prevented and that may very well be the best evidence and interview with the President on the issue of obstruction of justice.</p><p>So there`s a great deal that he can do to harm the investigation. We in Congress are going to do everything we can not only to protect the investigation but to assist where we can. And you know, in light of what you were discussing earlier, one of the things that we ought to do immediately is provide the transcripts of these witness interviews to Bob Mueller because in light of the disclosures within the last 24 hours of these text messages that Mr. Stone apparently have provided to NBC News, both the existence of these text messages and their content arrays a very substantial question about Mr. Stones truthfulness under oath before our committee and that evidence should be provided to the special counsel.</p><p>HAYES: I should note, in the other House of Congress, in the Senate today, Jeff Coons and -- Senator Coons and Senator Flake attempt to bring to the floor a protect Mueller bill that`s already been written and co-sponsored and they were objected to by speaker -- by Leader McConnell so that`s not going to happen. We`ll see where it goes. Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHIFF: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: All right, let`s bring in MSNBC Legal Analyst Jill Wine-Banks and MSNBC Legal Analyst Nick Akerman, both former Assistant Watergate Special Prosecutors. Nick, I`ll start with you. What is Roger Stone doing to your mind watching his behavior, the interviews sort of selectively leaking different you know, messages, changing his story, what`s he doing?</p><p>NICK AKERMAN, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: I think he knows he`s in trouble. He knows he`s a key target of this investigation. I think he knows he`s going to be indicted. He`s definitely going to be one of the people. He`s already been named by virtue of his messages in the indictment of the 13 Russians. Roger Stone is a little crazy. I mean, he -- I mean --</p><p>HAYES: Like a fox.</p><p>AKERMAN: Yes, right, exactly. And so, I mean, this is more of a P.R. thing because Roger Stone is directly connected to only one person in this entire thing and that is Donald Trump. They -- he`s the one that basically talk Trump into running president, has been friendly with him in New York over the years. He put up this big charade of being fired from the Trump campaign so we could go undercover and do all of these things that he does in the campaign. He is out there --</p><p>HAYES: Do you think he`s a direct connection? That`s the key to me because --</p><p>AKERMAN: He is.</p><p>HAYES: Jill, here`s where I see this going. There`s going to be effort if in fact Stone is indicted, and again, that is what he expect, Jerome Corsi also expects it. There`s lots of evidence as (INAUDIBLE). There`s going to be this effort to say, Donald Trump barely knew the guy. Do you anticipate that? Is that a similar play that was used back in the Watergate days?</p><p>JILL WINE-BANKS, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: It`s not so much that it was used in the Watergate days is that it`s a traditional pattern for Donald Trump. I know him well until they get indicted, I never met him. That`s his pattern. He does it every time. He said it about every single person. Whitaker, he knew until he didn`t know him. And so we can expect Donald Trump to say that very much.</p><p>The thing that does remind me of Watergate really goes back to the fact of the Attorney General and you mentioned the Acting Attorney General is under investigation for a scam for a board that he was on and the Watergate break-in was planned in the office of the Attorney General. He was also serving as the head of the committee to re-elect the president as the campaign manager but he was still the Attorney General. So the actual planning happened in the attorney general`s office which to me is really crazy and I hope we aren`t seeing a repeat of that.</p><p>HAYES: Well, having gone through the Saturday massacre and watching Whitaker now, there`s this sort of battle over him. There`s been news that the White House is surprised by all this. You got an active I should say, to Jill`s point, there`s an active FBI criminal investigation into the company, not clear that he is part of that investigation, but he was advisor to it. What do you see here in terms of his grasp on power and his legitimacy?</p><p>AKERMAN: Well, first of all, he is a political hack. Donald Trump put him in there for one reason in one reason only, as a get out of jail card free. I mean, this is precisely the problem that Elliot Richardson and Ruckelshaus foresaw before the Saturday Night Massacre occurred. I mean, they pre-planned to make sure that a political hack wouldn`t be put in charge of the Department of Justice. They both knew that they had to resign but the -- Bork was prevailed upon to fire Archibald Cox so that they wouldn`t put in some hack from the White House the takeover.</p><p>HAYES: That was the reason. What`s so striking is the doomsday scenario during the Saturday Night Massacre is what we have now with Matt Whitaker right? The doomsday scenario was at least go down the line of succession at DOJ. Don`t let Nixon just put in some guy to run the department.</p><p>AKERMAN: Exactly. Trump has just gone all around that. I mean, he has basically circumvented that whole succession law and he`s put in a guy who he thinks is going to get him out of jail free.</p><p>HAYES: Wall Street Journal reporting, Jill, as I mentioned earlier that that one of the witnesses has been before that grand jury, the Mueller grand jury was asked questions about Roger Stone`s intimidation of Randy Credico, this person that he has a strange relationship with. He`s a New York radio host who Stone has claimed at one point he was his sort of connection to Assange who was then berated publicly and privately at time to apparently intimidate him or at least that`s the supposition here. What do you make of that?</p><p>BANKS: Well, knowing Roger Stone and I`ve had the pleasure of being on a panel with him where he is quite charming in person but if you look at his history --</p><p>HAYES: In an odd way, yes.</p><p>BANKS: Definitely in an odd way, yes. And -- but I would say based on everything that we`ve seen and heard and everything that we know from the days of Watergate on, he is very likely to be a person who thinks that he can get away with anything, and that he would intimidate witnesses without even thinking that he was doing it. So I think it`s quite possible that that`s something that has happened. I think everyone underestimates how much Mueller knows.</p><p>And so they go in there giving their story not realizing that everything that they say there is some contradictory statement under oath by someone else or some document. I mean, all of the text messages and e-mails contradict what Roger Stone says. And people need to really pay attention to all of the things that get triangulated in any investigation. That`s what we do as prosecutors. We take conflicting statements and we triangulate and then you come to the truth. And I think that that`s going to catch Roger Stone.</p><p>HAYES: You know, it`s precisely -- what you just described as what Jerome Corsi by his own words says happened to him which is that he wanted to talk to investigators and they had all sorts of documentary evidence, perhaps contradicting some of the things he said. That`s in his own telling precisely what happened. Jill Wine-Banks and Nick Akerman, thank you both.</p><p>AKERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BANKS: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Before we go to break, I want to give you this news from Los Angeles tonight, just broke a little while ago that the LAPD is confirming at this hour that a Michael Avenatti, the high profile Donald Trump antagonist as well as the attorney for Stormy Daniels and others, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. In a statement, Avenatti`s wife says she was not involved in the alleged incident. Senior law enforcement officials tell NBC News Avenatti is expected to be booked into a local jail later this evening. Meaning he is currently in custody as I understand it.</p><p>Avenatti, of course, has been exploring quite vocally a 2020 presidential run as a Democrat. In a statement tonight he calls the allegations \"completely bogus\" and said he would be exonerated adding I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation.</p><p>Ahead, Ta-Nehisi Coates on where America stands after the Blue Wave Midterm election. Plus, blockbuster, truly blockbuster New York Times reporting on the insane tactics Facebook used to navigate the Russian interference scandal. And next, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries on the remarkable first day for a remarkable freshman class orientation, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORTEZ: Guys, there are secret underground tunnels between all these government buildings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest member of the incoming class of Congress is giving her soon-to-be constituents an insider look at the Capitol documenting her freshman orientation on Instagram as she and others learn how to navigate Congress. Two more House seats went to the Democrats today. And while eight races are still to be called by NBC News, there are at least 87 new incoming House members, 87.</p><p>Here`s a Republican freshman, those new to Congress who will soon be taking office on the Republican side, look at that for a second, and then here are the new Democrats. Yes, there are more Democrats and Republicans but there`s another difference. In case you need some, help here the two incoming groups of freshmen side by side. The Republicans overwhelmingly white and male, the Democrats look more like well, America.</p><p>Here was me now someone who will be returning the Congress come January and who had a hand in helping elect all those Democrats, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. How does it change Congress that this many new people in your caucus from this many new different backgrounds?</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D), NEW YORK: Well, it`s a phenomenal thing and they are the majority makers and in many ways we will clearly represent the gorgeous mosaic of the American people, you know, we`re black, we`re white, we`re Latino, we`re Asian, we`re men, we`re women, we`re young, we`re older, we`re gay, we`re straight, we are --</p><p>HAYES: Let me just stop you there and say young and older, spoken like a true politician.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, we got seasoned members and we`ve got newer members who`ve never served in elected office. It`s been a great combination. And many of these individuals, Chris, as you know, you know, they`re veterans, they`re national security professionals, they`re super moms, they`re nurses, they`re activists. It really runs the gamut and they will supercharged and energize the new Congress next year.</p><p>HAYES: Is it -- I mean, is it strange? You got -- the House Republican caucus is now I think 90 percent white men and the Democratic caucus is going to be 38 percent white men. I mean, there is something striking about the demographic fissures of American politics being so replicated in the -- your workplace.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, we absolutely represent the face of America in every facet possible which is consistent with what the Congress should look like particularly the people`s house here in the House of Representatives which as you know the Founding Fathers envisioned as the most direct representatives of the American people. And when you look at the other side of the aisle it`s like a country club that is pretty exclusive and I think that is the direction that we`ve seen our colleagues and the Republican Party going and they`re going to need to reverse course or they`re going to lose America.</p><p>HAYES: There`s a leadership -- all sorts of leadership talks, so there`s going to be leadership elections, I think you`re running for House caucus chair if I`m not mistaken, some other folks running for that position as well. What do you make of the -- there`s a letter out today of a bunch of Democrats saying they don`t want to vote, they won`t vote for Nancy Pelosi, I think 15 or 20 years those. Is there a serious challenge to her speakership or not?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, I think that she`s got the votes to be the speaker designee. I`m certainly going to support her effort and on her path toward 2018, I`ll be one of the people that support her. She led us into the majority once in 2006 and is now led us back into the majority. But of course, there is a desire, Chris, as you know for generational change and for that to be reflected in the leadership in some way shape or form. Hopefully, we`ll be able to work this all out in a manner that will allow us to then focus on the things that we promised the American people we would do lowering health care costs, increasing pay, cleaning up the mess and corruption here in Washington.</p><p>HAYES: So let me stop you there because you said that -- you said that the generation -- the desire for generational change which to me is the more -- most -- I have a hard time figuring out what the argument about Nancy Pelosi is. Is it a personal one about who she is and her ineffectiveness as a leader? Is it an ideological one? Was it a political one? Because people are on the trail and she`s been turned into this lightning rod I think largely by conservative media. What -- or is the generational argument. Is that do you think the argument that`s driving all this?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, I do think that there are people of goodwill who have legitimately concluded that our leadership moving forward and in terms of how we run the House has got to allow everyone to be on the playing field so they can contribute and elevate the aspirations and dreams of the districts that they represent. But I do believe that there`s a way for us to work this out, and the bottom line is as you pointed out, the other side right-wing conservatives tried to weaponize Nancy Pelosi to stop us from seizing the majority. It didn`t work. We`ve seized the majority.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, it`s a pretty good political argument. It also be a little weird if after losing in 2010, 2012, and 2014, reelecting Nancy Pelosi and then after winning in 2018 to dump her.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Yes -- no, certainly, and that is a case that`s being made and that we shouldn`t let the other side dictate to us how we proceed. I think you`ll see a more inclusive Congress in the next Congress in terms of how we provide opportunities to newly arriving members to fully display their talent and ability.</p><p>HAYES: That`s interesting. All right, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn. Thank you very much for your time.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Thank you, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, shocking new expose from New York Times on Facebook`s attempts to delay, deny, and deflect their way through the backlash following the 2016 election. Nick Confessore who is on this story and one of the reporters on that article joins me next.</p><p>HAYES: Tonight, disturbing new details on the lengths that Facebook executives were willing to go to in order to defend the company. In an extensive report based on interviews with more than 50 people, the New York Times says the company knew about Russian activity on his platform during the election long before they went public with the details. It reveals a range of unsavory tactics the company used to fight it`s growing list of critics including hiring and I quote here, a Republican opposition research firm to discredit activist protesters in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. Also, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.</p><p>Joining me now one of the reporters who broke that extensive report Nick Confessore of the New York Times, also an MSNBC Political Analyst. It`s a great, great reporting. It`s so massive that I was sort of -- I think all this stuff is new. It was sort of hard to tell. So I want to start with the stuff in there that seems -- some of the stuff that seems new is the extent to which Facebook knew what was going on 2016 on their platform and did not disclose that the public and slow walk their disclosure.</p><p>NICK CONFESSORE, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. So our reporting shows that Facebook first saw strings of Russian activity on the platform in the spring of 2016. That`s a long time ago. And it wasn`t until the fall of 2017 after they had done more study but also tried to fend off some of the emergent criticism that they finally told the public and their own board which sparked a major confrontation in the boardroom between Sheryl Sandberg and some others.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, you report that when they come to the board, Erskine Bowles, who is on the board -- he`s a sort of investor, and he`s been in and out of politics, there was a furious fight over it because he felt and others felt like this had been hidden from them for a very long time.</p><p>CONFESSORE: That`s right, it had been kept from the executives at first. And then when the executives knew about it everybody kind of clamped down and didn`t want to go public until they absolutely had to.</p><p>And when they had gone public in the fall of 2017, they said, you know, it`s not that bad.</p><p>HAYES: They kept minimizing -- I remember -- the statements kept coming out being like it didn`t persuade anyone. No one saw it. It was $100,000 worth of ads and every one of those statements were either just flatly untrue or massively misleading, right.</p><p>CONFESSORE: Right. And that was stage one, Chris. Stage two is, OK, we`re in trouble, what to do. And there you see more of the classic playbook of the big corporation in Washington trying to get trouble off its back.</p><p>You had calls to senators. Sheryl Sandberg put in a call to Amy Klobuchar, who is sponsoring a pretty strong bill on ad disclosure in the wake of this and said what`s going on here? You know, you are attacking us, said we`re a terrible company. So there was a heated conversation there, right.</p><p>But they were hiring lobbyists, obviously, which everyone does. And they also hired an op-o (ph) firm, a PR firm, this PR firm, Definers (ph), had done a lot of work. They`d done some media monitoring. They`d done press releases and press calls. But finally they were pressed into service to do campaign style research and to try and get stories written about Facebook`s critics.</p><p>HAYES: Didn`t they also create like a website with alternate news?</p><p>CONFESSORE: That`s right. So they...</p><p>HAYES: Like a literal fake news?</p><p>CONFESSORE: It`s not really a secret because it`s all on the masthead, but the Definers is co-located with a conservative news site that happens to write a lot of articles that attack the enemies of their clients. So in this case you saw that Tim Cook was blasting Facebook over privacy.</p><p>HAYES: In an interview with yours truly, actually.</p><p>CONFESSORE: And so all of a sudden there were articles on NTK (ph) saying that Cook was a hypocrite. You know, there were articles saying, well, Google also does a lot of data collection like Cambridge Analytica style stuff. And they`re also bad. How come look at those people.</p><p>So, they were trying to spread the blame and say, look, it`s not a Facebook problem, this is a big tech problem.</p><p>HAYES: There was a kind of public face/private face, which is one of the themes here. I mean, publicly they`re minimizing, privately they have their own engineers being like this is a big problem. Publicly they`re saying we`re sorry. We`re working it out. We want to connect everyone. We love connecting, you love connecting, we`re trying to figure it out. Privately they`re on war footing and going after their enemies.</p><p>CONFESSORE: Absolutely. What they don`t want is a regulation they can`t get around. And so what they`re trying to do is say, look, we`ve taken all the best ideas already and we`ll do them ourselves. Don`t pass a big bill. But then in public they`re saying we are ready for regulation. It is time. So, it is a bit of a two-step.</p><p>HAYES: David Cicillini who is the incoming Democratic chair of the House Anti-Trust Committee had this to say: \"this staggering report makes clear that Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers. We`ve known for some time that Facebook chose to turn a blind eye to the spread of hate speech and Russian propaganda on its platform. Now we know that once they knew the truth top Facebook executives did everything they could to hide it from the public by using playbook of suppressing opposition and propagating conspiracy theories.</p><p>CONFESSORE: That`s a searing press release from the congressman. And, look, I can tell you that while Facebook is worried about privacy rules, for example, what they`re deathly afraid of is antitrust. The thing that would really end what they`re doing is to be broken up into smaller companies. They`re petrified of it. But until now, they were worried that the risk was coming from Republicans.</p><p>HAYES: Nick Confessore, great reporting. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Stick around, Ta-Nehisi Coates is here in studio to talk about the historic mid-terms and much more.</p><p>Plus, tonight`s Thing One, Thing Two starts next.</p><p>HAYES: Thing One tonight, you can see all sorts of crazy things on the channel we like to call Trump TV, especially as they and the boss struggle to deal with the terrible election results this week.</p><p>Here was a good one from last night. Laura Ingram using a nugget she found on The New York Times to slam the incoming class of House Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAM, FOX NEWS: Something that is good for the economy will not be good for the socialists led by Ocasio-Cortez. Any immigration reform will be rejected by the same cadre unless it abolishes ICE. And cooperation with red will be forbidden. Nancy Pelosi has inherited a load of unruly children. Good luck to her getting anything passed by her own people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Huh, that`s an interesting bit of analysis from The New York Times. Wonder who wrote that? No, it actually isn`t analysis from The New York Times, no they`ve gone deep into the rando hot-takes of the website comments section to bring you autumnleaff -- two Fs -- with the perfect Ingram angle.</p><p>But if you think it`s just the people on the air you`ve got to see what`s been going on in the commercial breaks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Storm is coming. You cannot defeat the storm. I am the storm. The great American grizzly. Introducing, the original Trumpy bear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: The truth about Trumpy bear is Thing Two in 60 seconds.</p><p>HAYES: Trump TV is fast becoming the full service channel for the MAGA cultists. And it`s not just the hackery on air, what is happening between the television segments is maybe even wilder. Consider this ad for Trump`s pick for speaker of the house.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Jim Jordan, how great is he?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Jim Jordan is great and we need him to be our next speaker of the house. It`s time for House Republicans to pick a new speaker who will support President Trump and fight for his agenda. Please call 800-825-2663 to sign the national petition supporting Jim Jordan for speaker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And my question is, were they running the ad because Jordan was Trump`s favorite or was it the ad that convinced Trump that Jordan was his favorite? Either way, Kevin McCarthy was elected to lead the party today, not as speaker, we should note, in the minority. Sorry about that. But at least we still have Trumpy bear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Storm is coming. You cannot defeat the storm. I am the storm. The great American grizzly. Introducing the original Trumpy bear. Just find the secret zipper and pull out the American flag-themed blanket, then wrap yourself in the red, white and blue for comfort and warmth.</p><p>Show your patriotism and proudly display Trumpy on any American holiday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God bless America and god bless Trumpy bear.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Trumpy bear loves to cruise with his brother.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m a former Marine, and I`m proud to have Trumpy bear ride by my side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I ride with Trumpy bear, he makes my golf game great again. Thank you, Trumpy bear.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Simply style his trademark hair and place him in his favorite chair. Even the toughest guys will love Trumpy bear. Order the super plus Trumpy bear for only two payments of $19.95.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Yes, that is a real commercial for a real product airing on Trump TV. A spokesperson for the company that owns the trademark on Trumpy bear told Snopes, quote, \"no, this is not a joke.\" What is also not a joke is that all that weird storm is coming and grizzly bear stuff at the beginning is the exact language of the conspiracy cult QAnon, which has embraced Trump.</p><p>Now, if you`re lucky enough to come into possession of a Trumpy bear, you might be a little disappointed by some of the information disclosed on the tag. First, of course, it`s made in China. But also Trumpy bear is not for children under 12 years. Nothing Trumpy is.</p><p>HAYES: The president has backed down from waging rhetorical war with California as it burns. After a reported phone call from California congressman and soon to be Minority House Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday, Trump dropped his threat to withhold federal funding from California as it suffers the worst wildfires in history and instead approved the disaster declaration for the state.</p><p>Then today the White House released this photo of Trump receiving, quote, \"the latest update on the devastating wildfires in California\" while his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke surveyed the damage with Governor Jerry Brown.</p><p>Now, the same Ryan Zinke who blamed the summer`s wildfires in California on, quote, \"environmental terrorist groups\" who he claimed were preventing the government from managing forests and are largely responsible for the severity of the fires.</p><p>Tonight the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history, is just 35 percent contained. At least 48 people have been killed, dozens of people are still missing or unaccounted for, and in Southern California three people have lost their lives in the Woolsey Fire. It is only 47 percent contained.</p><p>HAYES: It is a fact of American politics right now that one party, the Republican Party, is overwhelmingly white, at least in its representation and its voters and its institutions, one party is not. It`s also a fact that one of the main thrusts of the Republican Party`s midterm strategy this year was rooted in bigotry and racism. The president spent the weeks before the midterms fanning the flames of racial fear by depicting Central American migrants as invading marauders.</p><p>And while that message may have motivated the Republican electorate, they still lost big. The new class of Democrats who were elected as a group that`s closer reflecting what America looks like than ever before. The question is, is this the start of something new in American politics or just a classic mid-course correction?</p><p>Joining me now is author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates whose most recent work \"We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy\" is not out in paperback. Great to you have you here, man.</p><p>TA-NEHISI COATES, AUTHOR: It`s great to be back.</p><p>HAYES: So, one of the essays in that book is called The First White President.</p><p>COATES: The last time I was here, was it to talk about that?</p><p>HAYES: It might have been.</p><p>COATES: I feel like we`re picking right up.</p><p>HAYES: Well, because in some ways it`s like a check-in on a bunch of the theses in that essay, which is that this is a man who harnessed the power of whiteness in a way no one had before, because no one had ever succeeded a black president. Where is that project now after these midterms?</p><p>COATES: I think it`s probably exactly where -- I`m trying to think of how to say this without sounding arrogant -- it`s about what I thought it would be.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah.</p><p>COATES: You know, I think there`s quite a bit of research, you know, that`s come out since then. There`s Michael Tesler`s book, which you talked about on your podcast talking with Tesler. I think all of the research has pretty much undergirded that. But I think more importantly, the history was already there. It was quite clear.</p><p>So the expectation that Trump would be anything else I think is quite naive and goes against the data, goes against the history, and goes against his own actual biography.</p><p>HAYES: When you`re talking about the ways in which all this data, and Michael Tessler is a political scientist, I talked about with him on the podcast, about all the ways in which first Obama and then Trump in different ways, right, cultivated and activated white voters, racial anxieties, racial fears, racial...</p><p>COATES: Well, I just want to be clear about it, I don`t think Obama activated it -- he activated it by breathing.</p><p>HAYES: Right, yes.</p><p>COATES: And being president.</p><p>HAYES: He did not cultivate it, right.</p><p>COATES: Right, right, right, right, which is very different than what Trump did, which was an active attempt to stir it up. And in many ways, you know, I think was a kind of genius to Trump in the sense that for years, you know, it was this notion that the Republican Party was all these other things, it was a party of a kind of principled conservatism, free market politics, religion. And there are people who, you know, legitimate, serious people that believe in that. But Trump said, no, you`re this. This is your essence right here. This is your essence. And that`s what we see right now.</p><p>HAYES: Someone made the point the other day -- I think it was actually Salin Azedo (ph) who is a conservative writer, wrote that like Trump -- there is this sort of argument about whether Trump`s base is racist or not and said Trump clearly thinks they are. It is clearly Trump`s judgment that these people are racist, because look at the way he campaigns to them.</p><p>COATES: Right, right, no, it`s quite clear. And again, its a mistake, it`s not a shock. I think though maybe, like I feel like when I published that piece, there was still some debate. I think the debate is disappearing.</p><p>HAYES: I agree the debate is disappearing, but what I think is interesting about the midterms is it also shows there is a limitation to the electoral efficacy of that appeal.</p><p>COATES: Well, right now it is, right now it is. You know, I was looking at the results, you know, like I`ve been very encouraged, no matter what happens in Florida or Georgia by, you know, the campaign that Abrams ran and that Gillum ran. It was a very, very encouraging campaign, because I think, you know, they stood and said, this is who we are, and no matter what happens came damn close, like really, really close.</p><p>And so I think it`s a statement for folks of our political persuasion for how to proceed. But you can`t guarantee, if those governorships go the other way, that the election laws will be the same the next time. We just don`t know. I mean, I`ve been a skeptic of believing in demographics and OK well, we`ll just run this again. You just don`t know. You just don`t know if it is going to be the same.</p><p>HAYES: Well, it`s also the case, right, that nothing stays fixed in politics.</p><p>COATES: That`s right.</p><p>HAYES: Right, so one of the things in the south, and this is what I think is remarkable, Stacey Abrams who -- whether she wins or loses, has 200,000 more votes than the last person to try this. A white man James Carter with the most famous name in Democratic politics in the state, right. The legacy of the south is you can`t mobilize black voters without doing something else, which is mobilizing a lot of white voters too.</p><p>COATES: Right, right, that`s exactly it. That`s exactly it.</p><p>And so the optimistic piece of this would say, though, every year we get a little more browner, a little bit more blacker. But again, you can`t assume that the laws are going to stay fixed, though. And I think like when I think back to `08, how excited a lot of folks were about the president, the first black president. One of the great mistakes that was made was not to assume that there was going to be a response to this, that some people are going to see this -- and there are other people who, for instance, who are watching how close Gillum and Abrams got and are saying.</p><p>HAYES: And are thinking about.</p><p>COATES: And they are thinking, you know, about how to actually respond to that. And so I think folks should not sit pat.</p><p>HAYES: But the other part of that, too, is -- and I think this is the thing that`s been encouraging to me about the midterms, is that backlash works in both directions, which is that it`s also the case that there is a contingent of Americans who watch Donald Trump, and they`re the majority. I mean, if you look at the majority.</p><p>COATES: Right.</p><p>HAYES: I mean, if you look at the majority -- there`s a huge -- millions and millions of people watch this and think, yeah, this is awful, this is awful bigotry and racism, and not just people of color, but like white voters too.</p><p>COATES: But, you know, I have to tell you, I wonder if this is how bigotry and racism in particular, to some extent, always works. OK, so you need a critical mass of deep believers, you know, who are hardcore racists. But you don`t actually need the majority to be hard-core racists. What you need is for the majority to be willing to look the other way, you know.</p><p>And so you talk about, you know, say, segregation in the era of Jim Crow, you didn`t need the whole town to go to the lynching, you just needed a hard core group who felt that lynching had to happen, you know. And so I just -- I am always skeptical of these notions of progress. You know, I`m not saying you`re wrong, but I think it deserves some pushback.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah, I agree. And I think what`s unnerving in some ways is about the way in which he seems to recognize that you can cultivate a very powerful 38 percent of the country, 40 percent of the country, predominantly white, the data shows predominantly with racial attitudes that are fearful and prejudiced and skeptical, and wield that power. I mean, he seemed to get that.</p><p>COATES: So the question I have going forward, and I know you`ve dealt with this question quite a bit, is what does it mean for us as a democracy, when you only actually have to motivate a minority, you know what I mean, and nevertheless you can, you know, be in a situation where you get a Justice Kavanaugh, you know? Like there are results to this, where you can affect the Supreme Court, you know, in such a historic way.</p><p>You know, this white vote that Republicans have chased for years, you know, and by activating a minority -- you know, I agree with you I don`t think it`s actually the majority of Americans...</p><p>HAYES: It`s the power of that minority that they`ve activated.</p><p>COATES: So what does that mean for how we`re set up as an actual government.</p><p>HAYES: I want to -- I wanted to -- you know, there`s been this story about the way that he`s treated certain journalists, particularly black women for the last few weeks, you know, even by his standards I think particularly disgusting, if I can editorialize for a moment.</p><p>This moment I thought was really interesting in the context of what you`ve written about and about the data about people. This is him talking to Yamiche Alcindor and his response to her. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR, JOURNALIST: On the campaign trail you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying...</p><p>TRUMP: I don`t know why you would say that. It`s such a racist question.</p><p>ALCINDOR: There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists, because of your rhetoric. What do you make of that?</p><p>TRUMP: I don`t believe it. Well, I don`t know, why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African-Americans?</p><p>That`s such a racist question. Honestly, I mean, I know you have it written down and you`re going to tell me -- let me tell you, that`s a racist question.</p><p>Excuse me, but to say what you said is so insulting to me. It`s a very terrible thing that you said.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: It`s a racist question. What`s going on there?</p><p>COATES: Well, I mean, it combines Donald Trump`s two great loves, racism and misogyny. So, that`s the first thing that`s going on. The second thing is one of the highlights of white supremacy as a force and racism as a force is this kind of truculent objecting. How dare you. You`re a racist for actually even imply that, you know, something I said might have been m racist.</p><p>So, I mean, it`s typical Trump. I mean, you know, for Yamiche and for the other black women who have been insulted like this over the past week, while it is, you know, completely predictable, I still think it`s absolutely outrageous and disgusting and I think that needs to be said.</p><p>HAYES: Yeah, Ta-Nehisi Coates, thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>COATES: Thanks for having me, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Also, thank you for being our first guest of the first ever live recording of our podcast, Why is This Happening? Which I`m really looking forward to. Even though tickets to the event are sold out -- sorry about that -- we`re hoping we can do more shows like this in the future.</p><p>Of course we will pulse that conversation in the coming weeks if you aren`t able to make it, along with some other great guests we have lined up, including one of our most requested guests ever. Make sure you`re subscribed now.</p><p>Don`t forget to check out our newest episode with Maya Sen and Matthew Blackwell about their amazing research into the way slavery continues to this day to shape modern American political life.</p><p>As always, you can find it on TuneIn or wherever you normally get your podcasts.</p><p>That is ALL IN for this evening. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

I`m Chris Hayes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with today`s hearing on Capitol Hill. It could have been a constructive effort to get to the bottom of the serious problems with healthcare.gov, but was, instead, used by Republicans to grandstand, to obfuscate, and to derail a law they want to destroy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what made it even worse was that today`s hearing focused on, let`s say, a weak spot for lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the Internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And again, the Internet is not something that you just dump something on, it`s not a big truck. It`s a series of tubes. And if you don`t understand those tubes can be filled, and if they`re filled, when you put your message in and gets in line, it`s going to be delayed by anyone who puts in that tube, enormous amounts of material.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): We know that every time Congress investigates the Internet, we`re in for a good time.</p><p><person><nameText>JON STEWART, </nameText></person>COMEDIAN: Is anyone on these committees charged with regulating the Internet understand how any of this Internet stuff work?</p><p>REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D), CALIFORNIA: I`m not a nerd.</p><p>REP. MEL WATT (D), NORTH CAROLINA: I am not a nerd.</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: I`m not enough of a nerd.</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH: Maybe we ought to ask some nerds what this thing actually does.</p><p>STEWART: You know, I think maybe the word you`re looking for here is experts.</p><p>HAYES: The goal of today`s hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was to get to the bottom of the massive failure of healthcare.gov. And as one astute tweeter described it, imagine all of your grandparents interrogating a group of Facebook product managers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the American people can understand how complicated this is. This might help a little bit. You know, you can`t re-cook eggs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I call them gaffes. They`re much bigger than glitches, I believe. Glitches are little hiccups.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There`s only so many passwords that I have the mental capacity to make up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You really start with one in Delaware.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pardon me, sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you really start out with one in Delaware? That`s what I -- the liberal press is reporting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m not familiar.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re going into a restaurant and you order two eggs over medium and the server brings you out two eggs scrambled, somebody loses.</p><p>HAYES: Texas Republican Joe Barton, a member of the infamous suicide caucus, who shut down the government for 16 days to kill Obamacare, spent his time today grilling witnesses on 47 lines of code from the healthcare.gov Web site related to health privacy rules known as HIPAA.</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS: What that blue highlighted area that`s been circled in red says is, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting stored on this information system. And Mr. -- Ms. Campbell and Mr. Slavitt, you all both said you were HIPAA compliant. How in the world can this be HIPAA compliant?</p><p>HAYES: It turns out the code Barton focused on is irrelevant. Tech journalist Clay Johnson noting, \"The whole thing doesn`t matter. If it`s not displayed to the user, the user can`t agree to it. It`s not like Apple can completely hide terms of service on iTunes and still claim people accept the terms.\"</p><p>But Joe Barton is less concerned with the facts than he is about destroying Obamacare.</p><p>REP. FRANK PALLONE (D), NEW YORK: Once again, here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody --</p><p>BARTON: Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>PALLONE: No, I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this is --</p><p>BARTON: This is not a monkey court.</p><p>PALLONE: Do whatever you want. I`m not yielding.</p><p>HAYES: Instead of trying to actually get to the bottom of what was wrong with the Web site, the GOP spent their time decrying a broken government they worked day and night to break.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The botched rollout is all the more reason that the individual mandate penalty should be delayed.</p><p>HAYES: But this is not the first time Congress has overseen t botched rollout of a big new health care program. In 2006, the House held hearings on the glitch-ridden Medicare part \"D\" rollout under Bush. Democrats worked with Republicans to improve the program.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I found the newsletter that I sent out to my constituents after Medicare part \"D,\" in which I said, \"I oppose the law that created this program, but people need to be armed with the information requested.\"</p><p>HAYES: So imagine if the Republicans who attended today`s hearing, like, say, Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania --</p><p>REP. TIM MURPHY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Given all these questions, Congress should press pause on the tech surgeon and figure out what went wrong first before throwing good money after bad.</p><p>HAYES: Had the same attitude he did when George Bush struggled to roll out Medicare part \"D.\"</p><p>MURPHY: Anytime something is new, there`s going to be some glitches. Even -- no matter what one does in life, when it`s something new and learning the ropes of it, it`s going to take a little adjustment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio.</p><p>And, Senator, do you feel like you were edified by today`s House hearing? Are you confident that Congress and Capitol Hill are going to get to the bottom of this and get it sorted out?</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Well, I don`t think there was much interest in that hearing in getting to the bottom and sorting it out.</p><p>Look, first of all, there is far too much contracting out in this government. You can look at NSA, you can look at Iraq, the privatization of far too much of the armed forces. You know, from foodservice to soldiers and you can look at contracting out here.</p><p>The fact is, the administration, of course, should have been better prepared, but the opponent to Obamacare, the ones that shut the government down to get rid of it are now saying delay it, delay it, delay it. They`re of course going to try to do that.</p><p>In fact, the issue is the president and the White House and HHS have got to fix this. They`ve got to make it work. A million seniors in my state have already benefited from free checkups and screenings; 100,000 young people have benefited by being on their parent`s health plan. Thousands of families have benefited already because they`re not denied coverage because of a child`s pre-existing conditions.</p><p>I just spoke to the head of the biggest Medicare company in the state, Medicaid company in the state today. They are going to sign up at least 100,000 people, come January in the first few months of next year, that didn`t have insurance before. This is going to work, we`re going to look back on this five years from now and wonder what the fight was about. It`s just like Medicare. There was opposition in the beginning and people become very satisfied with it over time.</p><p>HAYES: What did you think of Congresswoman DeGette`s comparison to Medicare part \"D.\" I remember interviewing you right after the Medicare part \"D\" vote passed. You were in the House and I was profiling you at the time.</p><p>And I believe you were -- you were opposed to that. And I imagine you turned around and worked with your constituents to make sure it worked.</p><p>BROWN: Yes, Congresswoman DeGette showed the kind of public official she is in Colorado, that she didn`t like the bill, I didn`t like the bill. I still think it could have been done so differently and so much better, instead of the giveaway to drug and insurance interests, as the Bush administration wrote it.</p><p>But I also knew that my constituents could benefit from a law that could have been better, but was adequate for the needs of some of them and we keep improving it. And you know the Affordable Care Act, as you know, Chris, in my state, and in most states, on the average, it saved a senior that stands -- that enrolls in this Medicare program, Medicare drug program, it saved them about $800 additionally, because of what we did in the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>So, that`s another benefit that`s come from this, as you know.</p><p>HAYES: And finally, Senator, what is your reaction to the members of the House, the Ohio House of Representatives, who are suing to block the Medicaid expansion that Republican Governor John Kasich has pushed there?</p><p>BROWN: I watched your interview last night. It was almost -- it was almost a painful mismatch to watch, Chris. And Connie, my wife and, Connie Schultz and I, were talking about it. But I`m just amazed by this.</p><p>I mean, I was with a group of people called the chamber of -- the Cincinnati Cchamber of Human Services today, a group of people that provide for people with less advantage in the community. And they`re just incredulous. As people I met yesterday in northwest Ohio in Brian were, that are taking care of patients with drug problems and mental illness. And they`re just incredulous that people would want to deny these hundreds of thousands of people insurance.</p><p>I was at a fast food restaurant in Centerville, Ohio, south of Dayton today, talking to the workers. None of them had insurance. They`re all making $9 and $10 an hour. Most of them will be eligible for Medicaid. They`re going to finally have insurance, their going to live longer as a result, and they`re going to have better lives, period, as simple as that.</p><p>HAYES: Senator <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown of Ohio, </nameText></person>thank you for your time.</p><p>Let`s turn to former Republican senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, currently a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a self-described centrist think tank.</p><p>And, Senator, I`m curious your perspective on this Medicare part \"D\" analogy. It seems quite germane to me insofar as a lot of Democrats opposed it. But Democrats, once it was passed, really did as legislators attempt to kind of fix the program, make sure it worked, communicate accurately to their constituents.</p><p>Do you think we will see that from Republican lawmakers as we go forward?</p><p>OLYMPIA SNOWE, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER: Well, you know, I hope so, because in the final analysis, we have to make the law work. And that, obviously, is going to be the responsibility and the obligation of members of Congress, as it is to conduct obviously this oversight, to get to the heart of the matter in terms of what was underlined the implementation of this program, because of the enormity of it.</p><p>But I do recall Medicare part \"D,\" because I worked on that initiative when I served in the Senate Finance Committee. Yes, there were problems with it in the original rollout, but everybody worked to identify and to address the problems. And the same should be true in this instance in the final analysis.</p><p>HAYES: What`s your sense of where the Republican Party is on this, having just come tough the kind of shutdown battle, have lost that. Are they still -- are the members of the Republican Party still focused on ending the law, on destroying the law, on gutting the law, or is there going to come a time where they just act as representatives, constituents who need help in signing up for the law or getting the kinks worked out or making the thing work?</p><p>SNOWE: Well, it`s important, as a lawmaker, obviously, to respond to your constituents. And once a law becomes a law, you really do have, I think, an obligation to make it work. I can`t obviously speak for our Republicans and how they intend to move forward. But I do know this -- that tying the strategy of delaying or defunding Obamacare was not the right strategy. Obviously, was not a winning strategy, and it certainly wasn`t an achievable one.</p><p>And what`s more, what is bothersome as well is that when one party adopts the tactic, unfortunately, the next, you know, in the next term, the other party could adopt a similar tactic. Depending on which position they`re in.</p><p>HAYES: That`s right.</p><p>SNOWE: If the majority becomes the minority or vice versa, they each employ the other`s old tactics. So, we could see this ad infinitum. That`s why I think we got to put an end to these types of, you know, warfare strategy, holding legislation hostage, and in this instance, bring the government to a shutdown and near default.</p><p>I think it`s a sad state of affairs and it really was a mega-overreach in the financial analysis.</p><p>HAYES: Former Senator Olympia Snowe, thank you so much for your time tonight. I really appreciate it.</p><p>SNOWE: Thank you, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Joining me at the table, Clay Shirky, author, professor, and expert on social media and Internet technologies.</p><p>And, Clay, you`ve been incredibly critical.</p><p>CLAY SHIRKY, SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT: Yes.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, unsparingly critical of the rollout of healthcare.gov. What has gotten you so frustrated watching this as someone who`s a technologist, work in technology, written about it?</p><p>SHIRKY: What`s gotten me so frustrated is that there are a set of managerial mistakes, separate from the technology, separate from the challenge, that didn`t have to happen.</p><p>It looks to me like what the Obama administration was doing was saying: we don`t want to hand Republicans hand grenades as we go along, if something messes up, if we have a mistake, if we have a glitch. And so, they kept the whole thing under such tight wraps, but what they ended up doing in the end was hanging over a gift-wrapped bomb of a much larger size.</p><p>HAYES: Right. And so, your point is that they weren`t testing early enough, and the reason they weren`t testing, and it must be such a bunker mentality inside there, precisely because of the reaction we`re seeing now, which is that if you start testing a product and there are glitches, you`re going to get killed for it. But, of course, your argument is that they were so scared of that, what they ended up doing was delaying this necessary testing process.</p><p>SHIRKY: Right. In fact, one of the things that -- anyone who ships a large technology project recognizes that you have to get through a lot of failure to get to a working system.</p><p>HAYES: Right. And it`s the process of failure and feedback that makes a system work.</p><p>SHIRKY: That`s exactly right. So what they did in a way, they saved up all the failure more after the public launch.</p><p>HAYES: That`s really important.</p><p>SHIRKY: And the real managerial failure, the thing that finally made me blow my stack, as I did the other day, was recognizing that on October 1st, when Obama was going to go out to the public to talk about healthcare.gov, no one could pull him aside and say, hey, chief, play it down a little bit.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>SHIRKY: Say we`re testing it in public, only try it if we --</p><p>HAYES: This is a soft launch. We just had a soft launch of a site.</p><p>SHIRKY: Exactly, exactly.</p><p>Instead, Obama goes out and not only compares to it Amazon.com, which is insane, because Amazon.com is the greatest, you know, transactional tool ever shipped on the Internet. So, already, he`s raising people`s hopes up.</p><p>Then, he issues this challenge. You don`t have to take my word for it. Go take a look.</p><p>The opposite of what he should be saying.</p><p>HAYES: And one of the things -- you had a very interesting interaction with the former chief technology officer of the Obama for America --</p><p>SHIRKY: Harper, that`s right.</p><p>HAYES: And Harper, and he`s a famous guy on the Internet, a real ninja coder. And you`re basically saying, hey, man, you guys set up this incredible thing on the campaign, this could have been done right, and he was sort of replying back and I think there`s a really interesting case study here about how government does big tech objects.</p><p>And it struck me this is the first time that you have a government project dependent on shipping, a big, massive tech project. And we`ll have to learn how to do this in the 21st century.</p><p>SHIRKY: In fact, what Senator Sherrod said earlier, which is the government needs to bring some of this in house, Tim Bray has also written a very interesting piece, saying, essentially, an increasing amount of government is going to be shipped via software. This is no longer something the government can buy on the open market. This is a capability that they have to move in.</p><p>HAYES: And there are certain capabilities, you know, building dams or building roads that have been moved in-house, and that we`re sort of used to the government doing. This is something new. That`s part of what`s so fascinating and I think worrying about this moment, we`re on the frontier of something new.</p><p>SHIRKY: Right.</p><p>HAYES: Clay Shirky of New York University, thank you.</p><p>SHIRKY: Thank you very much.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: No one spent more time trying to fix a broken immigration system than I am. I talked about it the day after the election and I`ve talked about it 100 times since.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And yet today, while members of the House were talking about monkey courts and amorphous clouds, the president was putting immigration reform front and center. When we come back, I`ll explain why the Boehner strategy on immigration spells doom for the Republican Party.</p><p>HAYES: We always love hearing from you on Facebook and Twitter. We know what Republicans think about the healthcare the.gov site. What do you think?</p><p>Tonight`s question, if you could have spoken at the House hearing today, what would have said about the healthcare.gov rollout?</p><p>Tweet your answers @allinwithchris or post at facebook.com/allinwithchris. I`ll share a couple at the end of the show, so stay tuned.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It doesn`t make sense to have 11 million people who are in this country, illegally, without any incentive or any way for them to come out of the shadows, get right with the law, meet their responsibilities and permit their families then to move ahead. It`s not smart, it`s not fair, it doesn`t make sense. We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Fresh off having successfully stared down the Republican Party over a government shutdown and a default, the president today eagerly moved on to the next fight, the big, unfinished business of his second term, immigration reform -- reform that provides a path to citizenship for more than 11 million undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that it`s a fight that the president can`t win because of opposition to a deal in the House driven by the Tea Party. But the contours of the immigration fight are strikingly similar to the contours of the shutdown fight that the president just won decisively. Indeed, perhaps the best way to think about immigration reform is as an opportunity to end a nightmarish shutdown of the basic legal rights of millions of people.</p><p>It turns out John Boehner could potentially end that shutdown tomorrow, if he would simply let the Democratic process play out.</p><p>Back in June, with Mitt Romney`s 44-point loss among Latinos, still fresh in their mind, Republicans helped pass a bipartisan, immigration overhaul in the Senate that included a pathway to citizenship. Boehner has refused to allow that bill to come to a vote in the House, saying Republicans prefer a piecemeal approach to immigration reform, but he`s not providing a lot of details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOEHNER: I still think immigration reform is an important subject that needs to be addressed and I`m hopeful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: The easiest way to address immigration reform, of course, would simply let the House vote on the Senate bill. And that isn`t a pointless exercise.</p><p>Earlier this month, 184 House Democrats signed on to an immigration reform bill, similar to the Senate bill. Meanwhile, the group, America`s voice, is counting 28 House Republicans who have offered support for a path to citizenship. That almost gets you to a majority. And it suggests the Senate bill has a very real chance of getting enough votes to pass if only Boehner would bring it to the floor. So why won`t he do it?</p><p>Boehner has long insisted that he will not bring to the floor any bill that does not have the support of the majority of the majority, a concept known as the Hastert Rule. Boehner has now broken the Hastert Rule so many times, he cannot hide behind that rationale anymore. Just last week, he did it once again, with the bill to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.</p><p>It wasn`t exactly under the cover of darkness. We all watched the roll call. We all watched Republicans vote against it.</p><p>So there is no longer any credible excuse for Boehner not to bring the Senate bill up for a vote. Because John Boehner will ultimately shut down the government and then John Boehner who opened it back up, and it is John Boehner currently shutting out 11 million people from full citizenship.</p><p>Joining me now, Jose Diaz-Balart, award-winning journalist and news anchor for Telemundo.</p><p>And, Jose, do you understand the basic contours of this, as someone who covers this day in and day out, do you understand them in the same way?</p><p>JOSE DIAZ-BALART, TELEMUNDO: I do, indeed. But, Chris, you know something, let`s forget about the Senate bill for a minute. Let`s just --</p><p>HAYES: Throw it out.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: -- forget that the Senate bill even exists.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, there has been a small group of four Republicans, and that whittled down to essentially one now, that were working on their own version of immigration reform, which would have included some legalization for the 11 million undocumented, not even dealing with the Senate bill, and that fizzled away.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: Where is leadership, both in the House, and I would question, in the Republican Party as a whole, when there are members, Republican members in the House, that are dealing with their own immigration reform bill, and that was left to sit and wither and die.</p><p>The question is, does the United States of America and does the House of Representatives really think that there is going to be absolutely no political cost --</p><p>HAYES: That`s the point, yes.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: -- if immigration reform does not happen. And don`t they realize the economic costs of no immigration reform in this country? The president spoke very eloquently about the economic benefits of immigration reform. And the Republicans that are so worried about amnesty, there`s an amnesty right now in this country.</p><p>There are 11 million people in the United States that you and I don`t know where they are, don`t know who they are, don`t know who the good ones are, don`t know where the bad ones are. That`s amnesty.</p><p>HAYES: And here`s the political strategy, as I`ve seen it, from observing this on the Republican side. There was so much pressure that built up in the wake of the election and the Senate passed the bill. And my read on this is the House and John Boehner are just like, if we pretend this doesn`t exist, if we ignore it, if we do other stuff, everyone`s going to forget about it and it will go away.</p><p>My question to you is, particularly in the Spanish language media, is it going away? Because my sense is that it is not going away. They`re not fooling anyone by not touching this.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: No, no. No, Chris, no. And you know what? Let`s just -- can we talk about numbers for a minute?</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: It`s not just 11 million undocumented. It`s 15.5 million Latinos in this country and some of those Latinos, if not most, know someone who does not have their documents, may have a cousin, a son, a daughter, a father, a mother who doesn`t have their documents. Every single month of the United States, 50,000 U.S.-born kids turn 18 years of age. That is voting age in this country. I remind my political friends.</p><p>And so, that is a reality. That`s not going away. It`s getting bigger.</p><p>The United States is getting -- there is more salsa sold than ketchup in the United States of America. That`s not just because, you know, white people are enjoying Taco Bell. That`s because the Latino community in the United States is every day becoming more Americanized, whether they like to recognize it or not.</p><p>And you know what? There but for the grace of God go is something that many Latinos who have their documents --</p><p>HAYES: It`s a great point.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: -- think of when they see 11 million undocumented.</p><p>There`s another side to this coin, Chris, which is there will be 2 million deportees under the Obama administration. A recent study at UC-Merced said up to 25 percent of them in 2011, up to 25 percent, have U.S.-born children. That is going on every single day and that`s a reality that is dividing and destroying families.</p><p>HAYES: We are seeing families ripped apart. We are seeing tens of thousands of deportations. Those have continued.</p><p>What is the political fallout from that? We`re seeing tremendous activism, very courageous activism, to stand in the way of that. But that feels like it`s falling on deaf ears in the same way that the Senate bill sitting on the House`s doorstep is.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: You know, if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it fall? I`ll tell you something, that tree that falls in the forest is covered and it screams every single day in Spanish.</p><p>We`re covering it, our community cares about it, because it`s their cousins, it`s their friends, it`s their mothers, and it`s their fathers. And every single day in this country, up to 1,400 people are deported -- 1,400 day, 1,400 tomorrow, until something is done.</p><p>But that`s not the biggest issue. The biggest issue is it`s an economic benefit to this country to have immigration reform. And once and for all, to know where the good people are, which is the overwhelming majority, and where the bad ones are.</p><p>HAYES: Telemundo`s Jose Diaz-Balart, a great pleasure always -- thank you.</p><p>DIAZ-BALART: A pleasure, thanks.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, do you remember this guy? He spent untold millions on Republican candidates in the 2012 elections. This week, he gave us a horrifying glimpse in an alternate future in which one of his candidates win, a truly frightening and apocalyptic chain of events. And that is not as farfetched as you think.</p><p>HAYES: Everyone`s favorite casino mogul and mega donor is back in the news this week. Thanks to a truly jaw-dropping piece of video that surfaced from his appearance on a panel discussion Tuesday night at Yeshiva University in New York.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Sheldon Adelson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMUELEY BOTEACH, AMERICAN ORTHODOX RABBI: So, you would support negotiations with Iran currently as long as they first ceased all enrichment of uranium?</p><p>SHELDON ADELSON, AMERICAN BUSINESS MAGNATE: No. What do you mean support negotiations? What are we going to negotiate about? What I would say is see is -- Listen, you see that desert out there, I want to show you something.</p><p>You pick up your cell phone, even at traveling rates. You pick up your cellphone, and you call somewhere in Nebraska and you say, \"OK, let it go.\" So, there`s an atomic weapon goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that does not hurt a soul. Maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever.</p><p>And, then you say, \" See. The next one is in the middle of Tehran. So, we mean business. You want to be wiped out, go ahead and take a tough position and continue with your nuclear development. You wan to be peaceful -- you want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee you that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, for energy purposes\" --</p><p>BOTEACH: So, a tremendous demonstration of American strength. So that they would get the message?</p><p>ADELSON: The only thing they understand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: OK. Let`s note a few things here. First of all, a nuclear strike on Iran`s desert would, in fact, almost certainly kill a lot of people, not just a handful of scorpions and rattlesnakes. Here`s a population density map of Iran. It`s pretty hard to believe you could drop a nuclear bomb anywhere on this map and not kill a whole lot of humans.</p><p>But, second of all, nuclear weapons are not BB guns. They`re not what you turn to when you`re standing on your porch, trying to scare off an intruder. You don`t use nukes for warning shots. And, if you did, you`d shoot out more than just your eye. It is absolutely unequivocally not OK to use a nuclear weapon to send a message. A first strike nuclear tact is a war crime of epic, historic, historic, horrific proportions and is unanimously viewed as such by everyone, seriously, not OK.</p><p>But keep in mind, this is not coming from some powerless old crank. These might sound like the rantings of an anonymous basement dwelling wing-nut internet commenter, but they are not. They are the rantings of an insanely rich and incredibly powerful conservatives.</p><p>A top donor who poured almost $100 million into last year`s election. A guy who hang out with republican nominee for president last year during his big foreign policy trip overseas. And, he is not just powerful in conservative circles. He is also hugely active and influential in mainstream Jewish organizations.</p><p>His support has been crucial, for example, to the birthright foundation, which sends young adults to Israel and has become a right of passage that tons of Jewish-Americans from all political persuasions participate in. And, this guy is instrumental in funding it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADELSON: So, there is an atomic weapon that goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert. And, then you say, \"See. The next one is in the middle of Tehran.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And, that is what is so scary about Sheldon Adelson. This is what would happen if you swooped in on some nutty internet troll and gave him billions of dollars in tons of influence. He is a chief influential donor, not just to the Republican Party, but to mainstream Jewish organizations, and here he is sitting in Yeshiva University in New York City getting applause for suggesting the United States launch a first strike nuclear attack on another country.</p><p>This man is using his power and influence to spread the fantasy that with enough strength and power, there is no need for negotiation, no need for diplomacy. That peace comes about through conquest and domination and bullying. And, it is a reminder, as the president moves towards open diplomacy with Iran, that skepticism of their intentions and roadblocks to nonproliferation don`t just run in one direction.</p><p>I mean imagine for a moment you saw this video but instead of Sheldon Adelson in New York City, it was an influential mullah in Tehran calling for nuclear attack. You would probably think, \"Wow! That is really dangerous.\" Do these people really want peace? And, the answer to that in Adelson`s case is \"No.\"</p><p>HAYES: The journalist who wrote a new biography about Rupert Murdoch says a lot was done to prevent cooperation with him. That journalist will join me along with a man who has been dubbed the Fox News mole to talk about the Murdoch media empire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): But, first, I want to share the three awesomest things on the internet today. We begin with the latest jab at the ridiculous sexy Halloween costume trend, which has evolved so far beyond the classic sexy vampire that BuzzFeed comes out with sexy Halloween costumes that should have never been made like sexy Mrs. Potato head. The unfortunate sexy hamburger, and the truly upsetting sexy Burt and Ernie.</p><p>And, now artist, Jillian Tamaki, is mocking the trend that jams like sexy unemployed contract worker. Sexy smelly old gym sock, sexy first edition of old man and the sea and sexy inexplicable melon colleagues. But, for the TV savvy, nothing really beats sexy remote control. That`s a real costume.</p><p>The second awesomest thing on the internet today, a web photo that will live in infamy, the resulting search for the mysterious Obamacare website girl. BuzzFeed correctly noting that frustrated Americans were greeted by one face as they waited. That face was everywhere and even inspired the onions, people in healthcare.gov photo now visibly panicking, as well as the obligatory CNN segment.</p><p>So, BuzzFeed got on the case, found the images filename tobe Adriana. They went down the rabbit hole trying to find Adriana. BuzzFeedThey called Teal Media, the design that worked on the site, even called its employees` personal cell phones, until a public relations person says the photos were provided that the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services.</p><p>Finally, CMS spokesman replied, \"The woman featured on the website signed a release for us to uses the photo. And, to protect her privacy, we will not share her personal and contact info with anyone. So, Adrianna is still a mystery. But, wait! There is just in, Adriana now says she will reveal her true identity if enough viewers like the \"All In\" Facebook page. Hey, it was worth a shot. And, the third awesomest thing on the internet today, back to Halloween and cool L.E.D. lights. Just add a kid and you get this.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Hold on. That toddler seemed a bit scared. And, what is that long, dark hallway that those parents used for their amusement when they could have been spending their money on a \"What does the Fox say, L.E.D. house.\" A note to parents, go easy with the spooky stuff on Halloween or your kid could grow up like this.</p><p>(MOVIE CLIP OF CARRIE)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): You can find all the links for tonight`s Click 3 on our website, allinwithchris.com. We will be right back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUPERT MURDOCH, NEWS CORP CHAIRMAN AND CEO: We are bringing diversity of opinion. We are -- there is a diversity of opinion on Fox News. You may disagree with that. We have many liberals there, many liberals invited. We have liberal commentators, as we have conservative ones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: Who are your liberal commentators?</p><p>MURDOCH: Alan Colmes, for one. -- Greta Van Susteren. You know, it is in the eye of the beholder, I guess.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Back in 2008, here is the story. A media reporter here in New York, a guy by the name of Matthew Flamm, wanted to do a story about how CNN beat Fox News in the prime-time ratings for the month of February. Fox had ended 2007 as cable`s top news network. So, when they lost to CNN at the beginning of 2008, amidst the heat of the presidential campaign, the reporter thought it was worth writing about.</p><p>Fox didn`t want to have anything to do with the story, saying, we will not participate, because they had no interest in talking about a story that includes other cable news networks. So, after being stonewalled, the reporter got an e-mail from a producer for Bill O`Reilly`s show from a private hot mail account, saying that Fox execs were, indeed, worried about the ratings had held a meeting to discuss shaking things up.</p><p>SigFox executives wanted to copy wanted to copy the success that MSNBC had with their election coverage. \"The Washington Post\" got a hold of the rest of that e-mail, which read, O`Reilly, not Brett Hume will be in the anchor chair, Tuesday night. We are going to have an opinion, monger, anchor, what is always been our hard news election coverage. To ask Bill O`Reilly to take over anchor duties would call into question the Fox News maunder fair and balanced.</p><p>So, although, the reporter only had the one source, he ran the story online. Mistake, none of it was true. Actors, hours after it was posted, Fox News pounced to a statement that a hit website, TVNewser, \"Flamm is so off the mark, it is embarrassing. The notion that O`Reilly would anchor election coverage of any kind is beyond absurd and wildly inaccurate.\"</p><p>When Flamm called the producer of Fox to see what the hell was going on. She claims they have no idea what he is talking about. By this time, the Fox producer`s Hotmail account where he originally got this scoop has been shut down. In short, he had been setup. According to explosive new book, Fox`s PR team had baited Flamm into publishing a false tip, so they could then discredit him and distract attention away from his story. And it worked.</p><p>And, that`s just one tiny example of how things operated in the complicated world of Rupert Murdoch, a man who is arguably the most powerful private citizen in the world. A man whose ruthlessness, win-at-all-costs mentality has changed the debate shifted the politics to the right across three continents. A man who owns a major television network, a cable news network, a major movie studio, T.V. stations, and more than a dozen cities, several newspapers, and a publishing company. And, a man who is very careful about how he is covered by the press.</p><p>He declined our invitation to appear tonight. But, we do have David Folkenflik, media correspondent for NPR, author of the new book, \"Murdoch`s World: The Last Of The Old Media Empire.\" So, the big question, when you do a book about Rupert Murdoch is, how do you report it? Because it`s very hard to get anyone to talk to you. How did you find the experience of trying to break into this world?</p><p>DAVID FOLKENFLIK, NPR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly helped. I have been covering media for over 13 years now, originally with \"The Baltimore Suns\" since 2004 for NPR News. And, it means that I have done stories over the years on all these properties and all these events. So, that happens. It means that I have the knowledge base to start with and a lot of sources to start with. And, then you build on that.</p><p>In 2011, on July 5th, I looked online in a video and I saw Prime Minister Cameron talking from Afghanistan with the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai about some hacking scandal that was breaking out in London. And, this struck me as incredibly important.</p><p>And, that itself offered an additional incredible window ultimately over time through documentary and evidentiary path, to how news corp. worked behind the scenes. And, in both these ways, through source work over many years, including intensely over the last two years, and through what we learned through the hacking scandal, even about what officials here didn`t believe, you can learn a lot.</p><p>HAYES: So, what do you learn through the hacking scandal?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, you learn through the hacking scandal is really in London. There was the purest version, perhaps, of the Murdoch vision. You had a company that controlled roughly 40% of national newspaper circulation. You had a company that had politicians at the highest levels of government vying for their support, because Murdoch would swing the support of the papers like \"The Times\" of the London and the \"Sun\" tabloid between the two parties. He could do business.</p><p>One of the misunderstandings about him is that he is always conservative. Well, he can do business with people in the center left like Tony Blair in the UK or when Hillary Clinton was running for senate in this country as well, in the center left. And, as a result, politicians will vie for his support.</p><p>HAYES: What comes through in the book, particularly the hacking scandal, is the raw sort of instrumentality in which the media outlet is wielded in these certain circumstances. I mean, it is a tool for power. It is a tool for influence that is wielded by Rupert Murdoch. I want to talk more about the Murdoch Empire, whether it is a dying empire or not.</p><p>I think that`s sort of an interesting through line in the book, and talk to someone who worked at Fox News and wrote a tell-all book about it along with the great Ana Marie Cox, right after this break.</p><p>HAYES: Fox News mole and Ana Marie Cox in just a minute. Earlier in the show, I asked you what you would have said in today`s house hearing about the failures of healthcare.gov rollout. Got a ton of answers posted to our Facebook and Twitter accounts, including Kelly Cash from Facebook who says, \"Since when has any version 1.0 software release worked properly? Heck, Microsoft Windows has been around since 1995 and it`s STILL buggy as hell.\"</p><p>Teresa Layne from Facebook, offering a solution says, \"Phone still works.\" @Repentedhipster on Twitter says, \"If I were in front of congress today, all I could have responded with was a face palm. Thanks.\" We will be right back.</p><p>HAYES: Talking about Fox News Rupert Murdoch and his right wing media empire still with us. NPR`s David Folkenflik, author of Murdoch`s World, which is just out and joining in the table Joe Mutto, a former producer at Fox News, author of the book, \"An Atheist in the Foxhole.\" Joe gained some notoriety on the internet as the Fox News Mole. Also joining us Ana Marie Cox, founder of Wonkette, Senior Columnist for the \"Guardian\" and the long time chronicler of the world of Fox.</p><p>So, here is another excerpt from David`s book about \"Fox PR staffers were expected to counter not just negative even neutral blog postings, but the anti-Fox comments beneath them. One former staffer recalled using twenty different aliases to post pro-Fox rants. Several employees had to acquire a cell phone thumb drive to provide a wireless broadband connection that could not be traced back to Fox news or News Corp. account.\" Is this sort of paranoia and ruthlessness? Is that part of the institutional culture over there?</p><p>JOE MUTO, AUTHOR, \"AN ATHEIST IN THE FOXHOLE\" BOOK: Absolutely. There`s a weird thin-skiness to anyone who works there --</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>MUTO: -- And, you know, any criticism must be answered with strong force. And, you know, there were at times when -- you know people seemed like they had to feed stories, opposition research, basically, to outside media outlets like drug report or the daily caller or something, attacking MSNBC or attacking CNN.</p><p>HAYES: Or anyone who goes after them. In the story -- in the Flamm story, they are circulating these blind quotes saying, \"We wonder if he is going to have a job the next day.\" They go nuclear on everything.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, there is a couple of things going on. First, they are trying to forestall that coverage.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: A very aggressive pushback, even when you make the first call to inquire about ratings. Let`s remember, the story on which that occurred was on such minor import. CNN had --</p><p>HAYES: It didn`t matter. They had one month that was good. It didn`t matter.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Who cares? It didn`t matter and they went nuclear on it anyway.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: The second thing is it`s warning the people who also cover the -- very clear. You do this, you could be in peril as well.</p><p>HAYES: Ana Marie, you`re not working -- you are working for the \"Guardian\" and there is a really -- one of the things that comes through in David`s book, I think is interesting is that a culture of U.K. newspapers is so different. And, in some ways, they are so much more central to the national conversation. Here I think in some ways cable news ends up being something that drives it a lot more. But, do you feel like Murdoch`s influence is on the wane or on the rise?</p><p>ANA MARIE COX, \"THE GUARDIAN\" SENIOR COLUMNIST: Well, that`s an interesting question. I was actually thinking, as you`ve been talking about this that Murdoch himself is a lot more nimble than Fox news is.</p><p>HAYES: That`s interesting.</p><p>COX: I think Murdoch -- to sort of reposition himself and reposition his business interests on the fly -- I mean like he`s actually a very amusing Twitterer.</p><p>HAYES: Oh, my God. His Twitter feed is the most hilarious thing in the world. Here is a guy who`s like the most powerful media mogul in the world, just tweeting there like every other person who is like frustrated watching the news.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: What more efficient way --</p><p>COX: That`s right, like he is watching the news. He`s online. He is on an airplane, whatever. But, I think he is very nimble. I think he is a really interesting person. I think his opinions are that of almost like a normal person. Like, he can contain two ideas in his head at the same time.</p><p>Fox News as an entity is actually not very nimble at all. I mean, they have sort of struggled under their own weight a little bit. They have one story decline that they push over and over and over. It`s been kind of interesting to watch them sort of try to feel their way through the GOP crackup, because they no longer have one boss, you know?</p><p>They no longer have one story line to push. They have conservatives come on that are more GOP and they wind up arguing with an anchor, and they have an anchor who is more Tea Party who argues with -- it can get a little confusing. I think that`s their sort of clay feet right there.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. And, does that scare you, that in some way Fox is -- there is a sort of question how much it`s a Murdoch creation and how much is a Roger Ailes creation?</p><p>MOTU: Well, I men to play devil`s advocate from Fox`s perspective, which having been inside the building, I know, they are surrounded by --</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>MOTU: -- from their perspective, liberal media figures trying to tear them down --</p><p>HAYES: At all times.</p><p>MOTU: Liberal NPR.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>MOTU: Far-left MSNBC.</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>MOTU: Far-left \"Guardian\" Newspaper. So, that`s why they stay feel they have to be so sharp elbowed and defensive.</p><p>HAYES: But, what I got from your book, that actual kind of feeling of embattlement, which is very much a Roger Ailes character traits mole reporting I read, it is also kind of a Murdoch traits.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: It`s not kind of a Murdoch trait.</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: -- It`s fundamental Murdoch.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>FOLKENFLICK: There`s this sense of -- you know we were the outsiders. We were the people excluded by the elites. Now, don`t forget, Murdoch is a man who graduated from Oxford --</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: -- He is a man whose father was knighted for his service as a newspaper man in the commonwealth colony of Australia before it was a country.</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: -- And, you know, he has the feeling that somehow he was excluded from the establishment. You know, when David Cameron in Britain met with people who felt that the press should be more regulated as a result of these abuses, these -- you know, corruption and bribery of the police, the hacking into phone mail messages in London, the victims and the celebrities, you know? His response was -- well, these -- well-paid, privileged people are meeting in secret. And, in fact, he has created the establishment to which prime ministers and presidents bend.</p><p>HAYES: This is -- This is -- Ana Marie this is -- that character trait comes through very strongly in your book and which comes from a very strongly in reporting on Roger Ailes, with a very similar set of character traits, which is this idea of being one of the most powerful people in the world, who views yourself as a scrappy underdog, being a member of an over class that use itself as scrappy. Is it a very dangerous combination? But, that is perfectly part of the DNA of Fox, Ana Marie.</p><p>COX: It`s a part of the DNA of the Tea Party and the GOP alike.</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>COX: That`s one of the few things I guess they have in common. You know, they are members of the ruling class. They are the people, the last bastion of the great white male, and yet they are so aggrieved. And, I think that, that is something that sort of, again, keeps Fox together right now. It keeps its story line together.</p><p>I do wonder what`s going to happen, you know, if that coalition becomes a minority. As the Republican Party sort of is unable to make a national party out of its using that coalition. I don`t know what`s going to happen to Fox. They have not proven themselves able to do much else besides sort of push that story line along.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: And, I would argue that Fox, under Roger Ailes and News Corp. and 21st Century Fox, the larger company under Rupert Murdoch, has a great gut feeling of what it`s going to do. Fox without Roger Ailes and News Corp. and News Corp without Rupert Murdoch, those newspapers may not be around, but Fox is throwing off so much money. You can`t totally dismiss that formula. It is working.</p><p>HAYES: What trend do you think this is headed in which direction?</p><p>MOTU: I mean I think Fox is going to keep doing what it`s doing. It`s reaching a wide audience, which makes it mind boggling that they still are able to strike this pose, like, we are the underdogs.</p><p>HAYES: That is right.</p><p>MOTUS: You know? Like they are going to keep it --</p><p>HAYES: At a certain point -- yes. At a certain point you have to choose between being sort of taking on the kind of aggrievedness of the victim and the power of the powerful NPR.

It`s hard, but it`s worth it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: While the president was in Boston trying to reboot the conversation around the new health law, House Republicans were back in Washington hard at work investigating the law`s troubled debut.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPER)</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>FRANK PALLONE </nameText></person>(D), NEW JERSEY: Once again, here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>PALLONE: No, I will not yield to this monkey court.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Today, the monkey court was back in session. This time with Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>fielding the questions from congressmen eager to get to the bottom of the rocky health reform rollout.</p><p>Did you know, for example, that <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>used to be governor of Kansas?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Madam Secretary, while you`re from Kansas --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As governor in Kansas --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were governor and state insurance commissioner in Kansas.</p><p>HAYES: Which is also the site of an iconic American film.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a famous movie called \"The Wizard of Oz\".</p><p>PALLONE: I know we`re not in Kansas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People went to see the wizard because of the wonderful things that he did.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those folks worked hard to go down that yellow brick road.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some may say we are actually in the Wizard of Oz land.</p><p>HAYES: That land you speak of, sir, is called Oz.</p><p>But Sebelius wasn`t actually born in Congress, which means she could not have run into the 90-year-old Texas<person><nameText>Congressman Ralph Hall </nameText></person>on a tricycle in Meade, Kansas, circa 1931.</p><p><person><nameText>REP.

MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: Some people like to drink out of a red cup, not a crystal stem.</p><p>HAYES: Stepping in to carry the torch for the GOP women was Congresswoman Renee Ellmers.</p><p>REP. RENEE ELLMERS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: Correct me if I`m wrong, do men not have to buy maternity coverage?</p><p>HAYES: Congressman Bill Long had other reasons for boycotting the new site.</p><p>REP. BILLY LONG (R), MISSOURI: I could not bring myself to do that from what I`ve heard from people like John McAfee, and folks about the security.</p><p>HAYES: You know John McAfee, the Internet security mogul-turned-fugitive from the law, and certifiable creep.</p><p>JOHN MCAFEE, INTERNETS SECURITY MOGUL: People asked me, did you actually sleep with 10 17-year-old girls and you`re 67-year-old man? I go, yes, I did.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, the rollout of the ACA has been rocky to say the least, don`t worry, America, Congress is on it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me is Congressman Leonard Lance, Republican from New Jersey, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Congresswoman Donna Christensen, a Democrat who represents U.S. Virginia Islands, also a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a doctor herself.</p><p>And, Congressman Lance, I`m a little confused at this point of the sort of Republican objection through a policy standpoint, is the idea that health insurance companies should not be able to cancel policies in the individual market?</p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY: That is correct. And that is the substance. First we want to make sure that the procedure works, which is the Web site. And I want to work with the administration to make sure that the Web site is up and running fully, as quickly as possible, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Well, that`s great. I think that is -- that is everyone who cares about the implementation of the law feels this way.</p><p>But just to -- just to make sure I`m understanding you: your position, the Republican Party position, is that private health insurance companies should not be cancelling policies in the individual market? That should be something they`re not allowed to do?</p><p>LANCE: I think that those who are satisfied with their health ca policies should be able to keep their health care policies and that is what the president has said repeatedly. And unfortunately, in many circumstances, that will not be the case.</p><p>HAYES: But you are aware that, you know, just for instance, one House study showed that in five years in the mid-2000s, that 20,000 policies were cancelled by insurance companies. Insurance companies cancel policies as a matter, of course, particularly in this market. Would the House Republicans be willing to introduce a law banning them from this practice?</p><p>LANCE: No, Chris, what we say is that if you are satisfied with the policies and if the insurance companies will continue those policies, that ought to be able to be acceptable. And that is what the president said repeatedly. And unfortunately that is not the case in many circumstances. And I think that that should be the case.</p><p>HAYES: Congresswoman Christensen, did you feel like you got a better sense, got your hands around what was going on with the health exchanges today in today`s hearings?</p><p>REP. DONNA CHRISTENSEN (D), U.S.VIRGIN ISLANDS: Well, I`ve always known that the health exchanges have been worked on from day one, when the problems first surfaced, that improvements are being made. We see that more people are being able to apply. And the paper -- those who are doing it by paper, those paper applications are being entered at higher numbers now.</p><p>So, I think yes, I am very, very comfortable that the changes that need to be made are being made. And that it will be ready, hopefully, by the end of November. But --</p><p>HAYES: And what is your reaction to the criticisms from your colleagues in the Republican Party about the fact that some people are seeing their current plans in the individual market cancelled?</p><p>CHRISTENSEN: Well, you know, there are plans that -- if they were in place at the time that the law was passed, they can be grandfathered. But some insurance -- as a physician, I saw patients with insurance policies that when they got sick, they were of no use.</p><p>And what we`re doing -- what is happening with the Affordable Care Act, is we`re raising the level of insurance. We`re improving the services that are provided. We`re making insurance more secure. And if there are any policies that don`t meet the high standards, they may not be able to continue to see patients, but -- to write policies for patients. But most of them are going to be grandfathered. Only about 5 percent are not meeting that standard, and are dropping patients.</p><p>But as you said, Chris, insurance companies drop their insured all the time for a variety of reasons. And I guess in some cases, they felt that this was a good excuse, whether it was warranted or not.</p><p>HAYES: Congressman Leonard Lance and Congresswoman Donna Christensen, I thank you both for your time.</p><p>LEONARD: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now is Clay Johnson, founder and CEO of the Department of Better Technology, a firm that designs and builds software for government. He was a presidential innovation fellow.</p><p>And, Clay, I wanted to have you on because you have been tweeted about watching these hearings. They`re all out of healthcare.gov. You worked on trying to do big tech projects. What was your takeaway from the hearing today?</p><p>CLAY JOHNSON, DEPARTMENT OF BETTER TECHNOLOGY: My takeaway was that we have a Congress that is dangerously illiterate when it comes to technology issues. I mean, looking at this thing, for me as a programmer and technologist, it was rather like watching people who can`t neither read nor write trying to be a book critics. I had no grasp of the fundamental issues at stake here or what is even and what is even bad, that was sort of baffling.</p><p>HAYES: What do you -- what did you emerged to you about what is going on with the Web site? Which it seems to me, Republicans have kind of moved past certain criticisms. Yet, that seems to be the implementation hurdle that this law needs to get over.</p><p>JOHNSON: It`s interesting for sort of fiscal conservatives to move on, and worry about this issue, whether or not people can keep their health insurance. You know, the system that we use called the federal procurement process, in order to buy and build Healthcare.gov is broken. And that`s responsible for $500 billion a year of spend by the federal government.</p><p>HAYES: Wait, I`m sorry -- $500 billion a year?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, a half a trillion dollars a year. T`s and B`s is what we`re dealing with.</p><p>HAYES: Goes through the federal procurement system, the system that got the various contractors that built out this Web site.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right. And I think it`s fundamentally broken, when you look at a Web site like healthcare.gov, that costs $200 million, this idea that that`s acceptable is clearly false. And so I think you have to take a step back and look at the thing that created it. You have to look at the idea that maybe we`re not selecting the best vendors or the best people are not working on this.</p><p>Look, when you build a technology project, you need three things. You need money, you need time, and you need talent. We had plenty of money and we had plenty of time. So --</p><p>HAYES: That`s an interesting critique.</p><p>Do you think that there is any way to reform that process so that in the short term needed to get implementation up and running or is this a bigger thing that the big tech companies and government is inevitably will have to do down the line?</p><p>JOHNSON: Look, the standings group came out last week and said that 94 percent of federal IT projects up above $10 million fail. The federal IT budget alone is $81 billion a year.</p><p>HAYES: Wait a second, wait a second -- 94 percent of federal IT projects above $10 million fail?</p><p>JOHNSON: Right, and the federal IT budget is $80 billion a year.</p><p>So, I don`t know why the Republicans are not up in arms about trying to fix the federal procurement process, because what they could be doing is really working hard on that, being of service to the idea of fiscal conservatism and opening the door to thousands if not millions of small businesses to compete on projects like Healthcare.gov. And they would probably do a better job at it.</p><p>HAYES: And yet, we`ve seen them kind of move past the Web site. I mean today, the thing that was notable about the hearing, I thought there was going to be a lot on the Web site, here they have <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>the woman who is ultimately responsible for this, and it didn`t get a lot of play.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. It was interesting, last week at the hearing with the contractors, Marsha Blackburn was asking about error logs and asking about, you know, HTTP request, and all kinds of technical stuff. And this time, she was talking about red solo cups and crystal straws. It was sort of -- you know, as a person who wants to see the federal procurement process changed, myself, I was sort of sad to see the right especially, but also the left, sort of move on from the actual Web site.</p><p>HAYES: Well, the monkey court attention span is short.</p><p>Clay Johnson from the Department of Better Technology -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get a letter from someone in my district, Adrian, she says that she lost her coverage. She is going on the exchange. She doesn`t qualify for a subsidy. She feels -- she writes this -- she feels betrayed by her government.</p><p>Now, she has to sit there asking herself is this fair?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Meet the newest Republican line of attack on Obamacare. We`ll tell you the full story, ahead.</p><p>HAYES: Hi there. I`m Chris Hayes, and you`re watching MSNBC, the place for politics. I`m here to talk to you about a new and very special part of our operation. We here at the MSNBC like to lean forward and so we did.</p><p>Out of the past and into the future, welcome to the new MSNBC.com. Now, not to worry, you will still find videos of your favorite shows in reporting. But now, it`s better in every single way. It`s not a Web site anymore. It`s a community.</p><p>So, go, make a poll. Join the group to create your own, because you can do that. Every nook and cranny of the site has something to offer. So, don`t stay too far from our page. Allin.com.MSNBC.com (ph).</p><p>Thanks. We`ll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Anyone peddling the notion that insurers are cancelling people`s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers to the marketplace, and that many will get new health to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper -- if you leave that stuff out, you`re being grossly misleading, to say the least.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: As the president responding to what has become the leading line of Republican`s attack to Obamacare in the last week, which is no longer a glitchy Web site. It`s now policy cancellations.</p><p>Republicans, you see, are now very worried about cancelled health care coverage and Obamacare forcing people into signing up for more expensive plans. But it`s not clear that is what is actually happening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Self employed realtor, she buys her own insurance. (INAUDIBLE) provider recently sent her this notice reading, \"Because of the requirements of new laws, we can no longer offer your current policy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All I want is what I currently have. I want to keep my doctors and I would like to have lower premiums.</p><p>REPORTER: The insurance company is offering her a new plan that would cost $484 a month versus her current $293 premium, a 65 percent increase.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: So, 65 percent increase, that looks bad. That was a report from \"NBC Nightly News\".</p><p>But contributing editor for \"The American Prospect\", Paul Waldman, saw the report and wanted to know what (INAUDIBLE) other options might be. He did a little digging, and discovered that by going on the California exchange, he got, quote, \"nine different choices for a bronze plan. The average monthly cost was $258 or $35 a month less than what she is paying for her bare bones plan.\" Waldman also found that, quote, \"she could get a silver plan with more generous coverage for $316, only $23 more than what she is paying now.\"</p><p>One of our producers also hopped on the California exchange Web site and came up with similar results.</p><p>That`s assuming the woman was 45 years old and had an income high enough she didn`t qualify for subsidies.</p><p>Now, the other context here is that insurance companies don`t seem to be giving people the full menu of options in the letters they`re sending to announce the policy cancellation. In fact, those letters seem like they`re being used to up-sell people into more expensive plans. Or as Waldman points out, it`s like getting a letter from your car dealer and saying, your 2010 Toyota Corolla you`re releasing has been recalled. We can supply you with an Avalon for twice the price.</p><p>What they don`t seem to be communicating to their customers is that they`re very well might be another plan that is ACA compliant that cost about the same as what they`re paying right now.</p><p>Joining me now is Wendell Potter, former head of the communications at the insurance company Cigna, author of the fortcoming e-book, \"Obamacare, What`s In It For Me: What Everyone Needs to Know About the Affordable Care Act.\" He`s now senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity.</p><p>All right. Wendell, I want to start with the baseline, which is what we had had before the Affordable Care Act, because I think that`s getting lose.</p><p>How common was it for insurance companies to cancel policies in the individual market in a given year?</p><p>WENDELL POTTER, CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY: Well, it`s very, very common. In fact, it`s one of the reasons I left the industry just because of that practice.</p><p>In fact, my own son was a victim of that. In 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was passed, he got a letter from his Blue Cross plan in Pennsylvania telling him that his plan was being cancelled. And his options were to go into a plan that was somewhat comparable, but his premiums would increase 65 percent or he could shift into a very high deductible plan, shifting from one that had a $500 deductible, to one that had $5,000 deductible plan. It was 10 time increase in deductibles. And that`s what he was able to do.</p><p>This has been going on for many years, Chris, and just is now coming to light. Reporter`s really have not focused on this in years past, so insurance companies have been able to get away with this.</p><p>HAYES: So, the big question here is what is driving this? And it seems to me there`s a few things going on. One is, plan that are being cancelled have to be replaced with a plan that is compliant with the Affordable Care Act, which means basic minimum, which are being enforced. But it also does seem to know, and I have now seen a bunch of these letters through these stories which have become a kind of genre, that the insurance companies saying you can enroll in this plan B, and it is a lot more expensive. But it is also not clear this is the only plan they`re offering.</p><p>POTTER: Right, that`s exactly right. It is a classic example of what I used to do for a living. That is, obscure the facts and use selective disclosure of facts to present something and make people think that they will not be able to get something that is better, and probably for less money on the exchange. They don`t want you to know that.</p><p>HAYES: What is -- what kind of -- just for people to kind of understand the overall context of the health insurance market, what sliver of the population are we dealing with and we`re talking about people that are in the individual market right now, that have plans that are not grandfathered in, that are being cancelled? Can you give us a sense of the -- the picture of, you know -- there are over 3 million Americans, what are we looking at here?</p><p>POTTER: Less than 4 percent, about 4 percent. Fourteen to 15 million in the individual market, it`s small for two reasons. One, because insurance companies have been able to engage in practices of black balling people because of pre-existing conditions. People can`t buy policies at any price, in many cases on the individual market because of being sick in the past.</p><p>And also, because they`re able to cancel policies when they want to and -- or price them so high that people can`t afford them. And so, we`re talking about a very small percentage of the population.</p><p>Here is the other thing, too, though. People who are currently in the individual market probably can get coverage that is better than what they have now. Because a lot of these people are enrolled in junk policies that companies that I used to work with where I absolutely have sold in the past several years. And they can probably, many of them will, in fact, the majority will quality for tax credits or subsidies to bring the cost of premiums down. So they`ll be paying less for better coverage.</p><p>HAYES: Quickly, Wendell, did the president and the people in the administration over-promise when they said repeatedly if you like your plan now, you can keep it?</p><p>POTTER: Well, it was unfortunate language, because the president nor Congress in this law can really control the insurance companies that well, that effectively. They control the health care system in many ways. They`re able to get away with this, and they are, as we`re seeing.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. It was a promise that now appears that they could not themselves keep. Wendell Potter from the Center for Public Integrity -- thank you so much.</p><p>All right, Congressman Barney Frank`s name was brought up more than once today on the House floor, cited as the authority, the man supporting the bill that is essentially a big wet kiss from politicians to Wall Street. But that`s actually not exactly the case. He will be here to react, coming up next.</p><p>HAYES: A big day for Congress today, back in the swing of things, back to work. House of Representatives holding one of its first floor votes since the government shutdown ended two weeks ago. And what did they vote on? They voted to gut a major part of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA: I think we`re a day in front of Halloween, and here we are handing out treats to the likes of J.P. Morgan Chase, Citi, and Bank of America. You know, it is fitting on this day that we should be doing the people`s business. And yet, here we are, handing out treats and goodies to huge banks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: The bill, which would allow big mega banks greater leeway in the kind of risky trading that caused the great crash, prevailed, capturing 70 Democrats along with all but three Republicans, in a touching display of bipartisan moxy.</p><p>But get this, though, the bill, HR-992, known as the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act was pretty much written by Citibank, along with its big bank cohorts. Here is a key section of the draft legislation as written by Citigroup courtesy of \"Mother Jones\", and here is the final bill, as voted out of committee by a 53-6 months ago and passed today by the full House.</p><p>As \"The New York Times\" notes, Citigroup`s recommendations were reflective in more than 70 lines of the House Committee`s 85-line bill, two crucial paragraphs prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks were copied nearly word for word.</p><p>In justifying his support of the bill, the current chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, cited the former chair of the committee, Barney Frank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS: And those who are loathe to ever amend Dodd-Frank, no less of an authority, than Barney Frank himself, former chairman of the committee, said, quote, \"It addresses the valid criticisms of Section 716 without weakening the financial reform law`s important safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary trading.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now is former Congressman Barney Frank, Democrat from Massachusetts, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee, co- author of the Dodd-Frank financial reform, and cited many times today in the House debate as someone who favored this bill.</p><p>Barney Frank, did you favor this bill?</p><p>BARNEY FRANK (D-MA), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: No, I never did. And I am touched by this invocation.</p><p>It reminds me what I have always felt about a lot of Republicans. They have a great fondness for dead Democrats. You know, Harry Truman, John Kennedy. They always like them -- I guess they have developed a new fondness now, for nonmembers of the house. Because that is certainly not a deference any of them paid to my judgment when I was there.</p><p>The fact is, I did say in 2009, 2010, when the bill came out in the Senate, that I didn`t think it was necessary and I thought we could do it other ways. On the other hand, I had consistently said since then, while it is not in my judgment, one of the critical elements is in the bill, it is a great mistake, I believe, at this point, to start picking it apart. One of the things that the Tea Party fundamentally missed in the effort to relitigate the health care bill is, there is an important issue in the legislating, when you passed something, when you had your fight and won or lost, you don`t immediately, if you get a temporary advantage undo it.</p><p>These people say, oh, well, the business community needs predictability. You don`t want to keep changing things. Well, they shouldn`t change things. Others (INAUDIBLE), we didn`t think it was necessary at the times, we`ve gone on from things. Things have evolved. It has now became part of the expectations, part of the -- so no, I never said -- I did say that it wasn`t one of the critical elements.</p><p>At the same time, I have consistently said I didn`t think it should be repealed on the principle that it is now too early to start undoing this. And, there is another factor, this restriction on the derivatives giving them out of the banks, to semi set overlaps revocable.</p><p>Well, if we have in place a very strong vocal rule, which keeps banks from doing some of this, that might after some years of experience lead you to a different conclusion. But, we are not there yet. So, this is frankly a fairly hypocritical invocation of me, this radioactive imputation of me, of great wisdom, which I never noticed in doing when I was there.</p><p>It was out of context. I know I was against the bill. I never voted for the bill. As a fact, when I heard they were saying that, I called my former colleague, Maxine Waters, her staff -- repudiating that.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. Here is Congressman Maxine Waters speaking today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE WATERS, (D) CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: And in case America forgot, J.P. Morgan reminded all of us the importance in setting limits on bank activity. In 2012, four years after the crisis, J.P. Morgan Chase, London well caused the bank to lose more than $6 billion in a few months. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And, here is one of the things about Dodd Frank. It was crafted in such a way so that a fair amount of the granular rule making was left to regulators. And, my question to you as the architect of this bill, how do you feel about the house and congress coming back to essentially micro- manage a lot the stuff that was intentionally left in the bill for regulators to make decisions on.</p><p>FRANK: First, let me defend that matter for you because you are right. To the extent that we got very specific in the regulation, we would have had two problems. First of all, things evolve. Things change.</p><p>We didn`t want to just prevent the bad practices of the past. We wanted all empower regulators to anticipate or deal with new evolving practices in the future. Secondly, the most specific you make a provision, the more easily it can be evaded --</p><p>HAYES: That is right.</p><p>FRANK: -- you just change a few pieces of it. But, here is the real problem, I am happy about that. But, this is what most bothers me and this is why I would never be for this kind of legislation right now. Once again, if you have the vocable and you have an adequate set of regulations, I`m willing to author this again.</p><p>But, here is the problem, the biggest single grant of new authority in the bill was to the commodity futures trading commission, which has the major responsibility for regulating derivatives -- financial derivatives. They were set up to do agricultural things.</p><p>Now, they got into this very complicated hundred of trillions of dollars derivative. They got a budget of a couple of hundred million. The serious attack the republicans have been unfortunately successfully making so far - -</p><p>HAYES: Is billing after that budget.</p><p>FRANK: -- is to refuse to fund, they wouldn`t fund the commodities futures trading commission. So, that is the problem --</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>FRANK: They have choked off the regulator and kept them from being able to do this. That, while taken together is why I would never support a bill like this.</p><p>HAYES: Really important point, former Congressman Barney Frank, thank you so much. We will be right back with Click Three.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, you definitely want to see this. An exclusive report from our reporters on a big deadline that is hitting this Friday that no one is talking of it that has millions of people panicking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>But, first, I want to show you the three awesomest things on the internet today. We begin with some evidence making the case for an actual -- Perhaps, like the one used by the seniors. The mildly rumored 80`s movie, \"Cocoon.\"</p><p>You see, if you are remaking the movie \"Cocoon\" today, and you did come up with an age appropriate movie star, the role of Ben, the kindly old grandfather played by mustache old character actor Wilford Brimley, who would you get? Why you could get George Clooney, who is a year older than Wilford Brimley was when \"Cocoon\" was released.</p><p>That shocking information was reviewed by bosure.com today, showing how well-preserved today`s movie stars really are. For instance, would you have get that dashing Denzel Washington is one year frankly for being old enough to play Matt Lock, or Betty Davis playing the Baby Jane is only one year older than dancing nimble, Ellen Degeneres is today.</p><p>When Jack Lemmon starred in \"Grumpy Old Men,\" he was only two years older than today`s Samuel L. Jackson and while we can`t picture Jackson as a grumpy old man, there has been a lot of time using himself to Jack Lemmon in \"Pulp Fiction.\"</p><p>The second most awesome thing on the internet today, windows to the soul. You are not looking at some kind of post-modern jack-o-lantern. It is actually a house, bought for just about $500 and made entirely out of recycled windows. Photographer Nick Olsen, designer Lilah Horwitz spent seven months constructing this west Virginia cabin. That is not their primary home, it is a wonderful retreat back to nature. No plumbing or electricity. There is a whole lot of sunshine.</p><p>Whatever the deficiencies, it sure beats this building, which you could call its pole opposite. That is a high-rise in china ha upon further inspection, has fake windows painted on it. Fine, if you`re a vampire, not fine if you ever want to see outside. But to be fair, it is a lot safer for birds flying through the air than this place.</p><p>And, the third awesomest thing on the internet today. I`m not the only one who loves the pope. This kid loves him, too. During the Vatican celebration, children were seated around the Pope Francis` platform. And, this little fellow decided to do a little free-lancing.</p><p>Before long, the children sudden became a duo, begging for their own sitcom. At first, the youngster was protective of the Holy Father wanting Pop Francis` attention -- and started helping people up to the stage for a meeting with the pontiff. Pope Francis was totally cool with it. It all ended in a touching embrace.</p><p>It is quite an achievement in Grantsville upstaging so much so, we`re convinced this kid went to the -- Giuliani Academy of public events interruptions. You can find all the links for tonight`s Click Three on our website, allinwithchris.com, we`ll be right back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CIP)</p><p>HAYES: This Friday, 47 million poor people are going to have their benefits cut. You probably haven`t heard about it, but food agencies that are struggling to feed the growing ranks of America`s hungry are in full- out panic mode. It is called the hunger cliff, and as you are about to see in our exclusive report we are about to go over it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): The sun has not come up yet outside the river fun food pantry in Queens, New York. But, many of the hundreds who line up here every Saturday have already been here for hours, bundled up against the cold. They come before sunrise for free food, cereal, vegetables, sometimes meat so that can feed themselves and their kids for another week. For many here on food stamps, it is not enough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: I went here to exercise 45 because the line is so long. I try to come up 10. The line is all the way to that corner and I spent four hours on the line.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Last year, 47 million people, a full 15% of the population depended on food stamp assistance. And, their lives are about to get harder. When provisions for the 2009 stimulus package expire tomorrow night, $5 billion in cuts to the food stamp program will take effect.</p><p>That means a lot to the people who need food the most. Average food stamp recipient gets about $133 in benefits per month, or less than a $1.50 per meal. For a family of four, the cuts coming down the line work out to 24 fewer meals every month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: I read on the newspaper that today there will be a cutback. I reached to the point, I didn`t know what to do. I don`t know, maybe I may have to go somewhere else to see if I could get some more food. I really don`t know. I really don`t know, but it would really hit me hard.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): The cuts to food stamps also called snap benefits are the first big hit in what activists have taken to calling the hunger cliff. The second hit may come soon. In Washington, a committee met today, starting to reconcile the house and senate version of the farm bill, which has long been the vehicle for food stamp legislation.</p><p>The senate version of the bill cuts more than $4 billion to food stamps over a decade. The house wants to cut who whopping $39 billion and kick nearly 4 million people off the program. While <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had promised to veto major cuts with the snap program, it is likely additional cuts are coming.</p><p>Some republicans have tried to spin these cuts as humane. Representatives from Sutherland, Florida has led the charge for the food stamp cuts in the house told \"The Washington Post\" that being dependent on food stamps makes you more vulnerable. <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>suggested that cutting food stamps is doing the poor a favor.</p><p><person><nameText>PAUL RYAN, </nameText></person>(R) WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN: We don`t want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): And, others, just seem to want to punish the hunger.</p><p>STEPHEN FINCHER, (R) TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): That was Stephen Fincher, republican of Tennessee, who himself has taken nearly $3.5 million from taxpayers to finance farm -- provided by the very single farm bill -- food stamp recipients as leads to vultures. But, the truth is that nearly half of food stamp recipients are children.</p><p>And, more than four in ten will live in household or someone works. Many of those without a job desperately want one. Elizabeth Ferrera is a single mother with a master`s degree.</p><p>ELIZABETH FERRERA, SINGLE MOTHER: I need food stamps and I need food in order to survive, you know to feed my three children. It is really hard to get a job out there. Even though I have all the qualifications, you know, they still don`t hire all the people.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Zurica Abdul have to stay home to take care of her disabled 15-year-old daughter.</p><p>ZURICA ABDUL, MOTHER OF DISABLED DAUGHTER: I am with my 6-year-old, sometimes, she told me she is hungry and I have nothing to give her. So, it is very hard. You know, when you just have milk and you have to warm it and give to child of 6. You need money to go to school without food.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Abdul is one of thousands in New York alone who depends on food pantries to make ends meet. But, because of the sequester, food pantries are already dealing with a 5% reduction in federal subsidies, even as they see needs increasing due to the cuts to food stamps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: The senior who is getting $700, our rent is $500, their medicine is $5 to $10 per prescription. So, you put that altogether, what is left? So, you know? So, I think if you can get food, you know some of it is actually a dire need just to meet the essentials.</p><p>But, some of it is actually trying to put together a picture that they can survive. I know a lot of people think that people come here for food. You know, a lot of times they hear the word moocher and things like that. I have to say it is offensive to me because I want to challenge anyone out there to come during the winter, to come at 3:00 in the morning, stand in this line and wait for food.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): If house republicans have their way, that line is only get longer.</p><p>ABDUL: Every day you come to get money, if you have $307, you come, you are going to spend 300 this week, you can`t go over, you know? Once you go over, then before the month is up, it is three or four days sometimes you don`t have enough food to eat. So, it is very hard. If they cut it, you know, a lot of people is going to suffer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: What about all the years I paid taxes? You know? I worked so hard. And, when it is time now, I believe that I should get some help. Look what happens now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: For more on the Hunger Cliff, check out our reporter Ned Resnikoff`s great piece on msnbc.com. Fantastic companion photos from John Trotter. A congressman who is fighting the GOP food stamp cuts and people on the frontlines of the hunger battle will join me next, stick around.</p><p>HAYES: We are back, and joining me now is Joel Berg, Executive Director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger, author of \"All You Can Eat: How Hungry Is America?\" Margarette Purvis, president and CEO of Food Bank from New York City and Congressman Jim McGovern, democrat from Massachusetts, a member of the house agriculture committee and co-chair of House Hunger Caucus.</p><p>Joe and Margarette, I want to start with you, $5 billion in cuts happen on Friday. That money goes away. Now, it is an $80 billion a year program more or less. That is, you know, a little more than 5%, but how big a deal is this really?</p><p>MARGARETTE PURVIS, CEO OF FOOD BANK FOR NEW YORK CITY: This is the biggest of deals. You know, just in New York City alone, these cuts will wipe out 76 million meals from people who need it the most.</p><p>Already, we know that a family, who typically have their benefits -- their food stamps, it will last until about the third week without the cuts. You know, the fourth week of the month that they decided to do this, it is for thanksgiving --</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>PURVIS: -- it is for Hanukkah. It makes absolutely no sense, especially since we all know that nothing has happened differently with our economy.</p><p>HAYES: How about, can private charities kicked in? Is this -- you know, I give money to food banks, people give money to food banks.</p><p>JOEL BERG, NEW YORK COALITION AGAINST HUNGER: And, you should, but no one should be fooled into thinking this can solve the problem. Every food bank, soup kitchen, food pantry in America distributes about $5 billion worth of food. So, this cut goes into effect now, this is as if all of these charities didn`t exist for a year. And, the cuts being proposed --</p><p>HAYES: The cuts that happen on Friday, automatically that no one is talking about, they`re not like a political issue. Those just are equal to the sum total of privately charity funded food assistance in the entire nation. That is the size of the cut.</p><p>BERG: Correct. As media matters pointed out until this segment as far as we know this is the first network news show to even discuss 48 million people losing food. And, the house cuts on top of this would be eight times what charities distribute in a year.</p><p>HAYES: And, Congressman, I want to go to you on that. The republicans have proposed a $39 billion cuts to programs. That is over 10-year window that is to be scored about $4 billion a year. One of the things that I think is interesting here is it seems to me like these food stamps were something there was a political consensus around, until recently.</p><p>I wanted to show you just an image from Fox News who has been doing a lot of reporting, I guess you can call. This is just an image. Quote, unquote, \"Poor households reviewed that 99.6% of them have a refrigerator.\" The implication being that these people are not really poor. They don`t actually need this. Have you seen the political consensus around this very basic aspect of safety net necessity, erode?</p><p>JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN: Unfortunately, yes. There used to be a bipartisan consensus that any hunger was something that we ought to be committed to. Unfortunately, that bipartisan consensus disappeared. And, what we have seen as republicans belittle poor people, and diminish their struggle, and basically use them as political funds in their budget struggle.</p><p>Every family tried to find savings, it comes from programs like SNAP or programs that help poor people and it is very frankly now unfortunate. It is really sad. And, if government stands for anything, we ought to be there for the people who are most vulnerable.</p><p>HAYES: Is there going to be any way to avoid further cuts when you are considering reconciling a senate bill that has got $4 billion in cuts over ten years and a house bill that has got $39 billion in cuts over ten years?</p><p>MCGOVERN: Well, I`m on the conference committee of the farm bill, and I said today that you know I am willing to be flexible. I am willing to be reasonable but I`m not going to support a farm bill that makes more people hungry in America. We ought to at least agree on that.</p><p>And, I don`t believe that we should have anymore cuts in SNAP. We should be talking about how to end hunger, not just talking about trying to protect the program. We ought to have some White House leadership quite frankly. We need to have White House conference on food and nutrition to bring people together and actually have a road map to end hunger.</p><p>That is what we should -- That is where our discussion should be focused, not on these cutbacks to SNAP. But, we`re going to fight hard to make sure there is no further damage to SNAP. But, it is an uphill battle, given the makeup of the House of Representatives.</p><p>HAYES: One of the things that have attracted kind of the political attention by conservative and Fox News and republicans is that there has been massive growth in the food stamp program. That is not a right wing lie. That program has gotten much more expensive. $80 billion is a lot of money. We shouldn`t not mince words about the size of the program. Why has the size of the program expanded so much?</p><p>PURVIS: The size of the program reflects the size of the problem. It is not growing off on its own. It reflects that there is a huge hunger crisis. The problem is that we are treating the issue as the people, rather than the issue of being why is hunger this bad in this country? Everyone should be upset about this, not upset at the people who are suffering through it.</p><p>HAYES: Why is it so bad in this country? And, what is the answer to that question?</p><p>BERG: Living wages, jobs. People complaining about food stamps and Snap having to fill in the gap are the very same people wrecking economy. They are not really anti-government. They are anti-government for other people. Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida. who is complaining bitterly about the food stamp program. He admitted he received benefits earlier in life. So, my organization sent him a letter with a mirror in it, and said if you want to see what a food stamp recipient looks like, check this out.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MCGOVERN: And, Chris, may I just add. Look, the majority of people on food stamps are senior citizens and children. All of the able-bodied you know, people that can actually work, majority of those people work. Many of them work full-time and they still earn so little that they qualify for this benefit. So, we have a lousy economy, when the economy gets better, fewer people will be on food stamps.</p><p>HAYES: But congressman, to push you more on that, it is now -- we are now four years in this recovery. And, when we are going into the reporting of this and looking into the numbers -- I mean 15% of Americans are poor. 47 million people, I look at that and I say America, this is not working.</p><p>What we are doing right now, our system, the system we`re running is failing. 47 million people in poverty, hungry in this country is a failing grace. It is American capital is not producing at this moment, broad gains for people. It is not.</p><p>MCGOVERN: That is why we need a broader discussion. That is why we need a White House conference on food and nutrition to talk about how you end this problem. Not just how you put band aids on it. But, we need to be talking about increasing the minimum wage. We need to be talking about increasing the minimum wage.</p><p>We need to be talking about how you extend letters of opportunity to help people get out of poverty. But, in the meantime, we need to make sure that we are there with the safety net to make sure people have at least enough to eat.</p><p>Boy, what a radical idea that everybody in this country, the richest country in the history of the world ought to have enough to eat. Surely, we should be able to get a bipartisan consensus on that, but unfortunately in Washington that consensus has blown up.</p><p>HAYES: We declared the war on poverty. We actually won that poverty. That is incredibly in successful social and then we just decided to turn tail and run. Joel Berg from the New York Coalition Against Hunger, Margarett Purvis from Food Bank for New York City, and Congressman Jim McGovern, thank you very much.
